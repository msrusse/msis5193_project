            "If you are a Marvel fan, then The Avengers will feel like Christmas. Thanks to the merry doings of the director, Joss Whedon, all your favorite characters are here, as shiny and as tempting as presents under the tree.",
            "A movie that yells at you and geeks out in equal measures.",
            "Ultimately, it all comes back to Whedon: His clear vision for each character and how they might be profitably intermingled; his unexpected knack for action choreography; his funny, tender, immaculately constructed script.",
            "A spectacle in the grandest sense of the word ...",
            "The Avengers will undoubtedly please nearly all fanboys and most other moviegoers hoping for the quintessential popcorn flick experience. ",

            "'The Avengers' May Be the Best Comic Book Film Ever Made",
            "Clever, funny, emotional, and downright amazing; The Avengers is a spectacle which demands repeat viewings. Joss Whedon has delivered what is quite simply an epic comic book movie masterpiece.",
            "...not without its flaws, but Joss Whedon has put together an immensely enjoyable film, the best Marvel-based one to date, and one that is not in the least bit ashamed of its comic book roots.",
            "This star-studded, action packed film lives up to all the hype.",
            "The Avengers is as close as you can get to a quintessential blockbuster experience. One of the rare MCU films where the action beats feel entirely like extensions of story and character.",
            "Overall, Marvel's Avengers Assemble is fun, funny and downright entertaining. Joss Whedon did good.",
            "I think the problem is inherent in the format.",
            "It is no longer enough for one superhero to fight a single villain while dealing with his own personal problems, apocalypse must now enter into it.",

            "Tightly scripted and filled with enough moments of levity to balance the extended and spectacular battle sequences. ",
            "Gets everything right. So entertaining when our characters gather to fight Loki who is the best. ",
            "Marvel's The Avengers is the team-up movie that we've been waiting for and it's absolutely everything we wanted it to be.",
            "The film begins with a bang and builds from there, a thrill ride peppered with Whedon's trademark self-aware humor. It's fun to watch all these egos clash, especially Downey, who just owns the Tony Stark role.",
            "The Avengers will appeal to fans of comic books, fans of action and fans of characterization and dialogue. It's a pretty awesome assembly.",
            "This all-star superhero extravaganza is fun entertainment at a grand scale.",

            "While Ayer and his cast demonstrate a thorough understanding of their subject, and their movie features realistic violence and casual callousness, End Of Watch doesn't really go anywhere.",
            "Capturing the stress and tension of the job detail, as well as the emotional toll on the officers, the line between audience and actor is blurred as the camera alternates between their perspective and that of the audience.",

            "One longs for more scenes between the ensemble on the ground, but the emphasis on aerial (and digital) technology leaves the characters without context.",

            "Why, one wonders, didn't Lucas persuade his friend Steven Spielberg to take on this subject and treat it with the authority and respect he brought to Band of Brothers?",
            "The actors do their best, but the lines they have to deliver are toe-curlingly bad. Things get better when the planes are in the air, but the film's aerial dogfights are so blatantly computer-generated that the action fails to thrill.",
            "What a missed opportunity.",
            "While the film soars in the skies, on the ground there's nothing original in the script.",
            "It's an inspirational story and its infectious sense of camaraderie may well be an effective recruitment film for the U.S. air force."

            "It isn't very scary, but it does pile a bunch of really tasteless twists on towards the end that make no sense and it almost becomes a comedy. On one hand, is a failure as a horror film, but as an exercise in desperation, it's kind of a hoot",
            "exactly what you'd expect from a PG-13 horror movie dropped in September. There's really nothing particularly scary about it, and the story ranges from shaky to thin",
            "House at the End of the Street reveals itself to be merely another forgettable PG-13 thriller banking on the brain-dead mall crowd to tweet their unending love for a crummy feast such as this.",
            "The screenplay has a nice twist that could have supported a stylish giallo-style thriller; unfortunately, director Mark Tonderai delivers a mess -- an almost random tangle of choppy edits, handheld camera, 'shock' sound effects and other horror cliches.",
            "Formulaic, unoriginal suspense thriller aided by a plot twist and good leads, that might delight the less-gore-is-more teenage audience.",
            "A routine 'Don't go down to the basement' thriller, but watching Jennifer Lawrence go through her paces makes it enjoyable. "

            "The ironic handling of decor and characterisation builds an eerie portrait of the blissed-out West Coast bourgeoisie at their most brainwashed.",
            "It may very well be Haynes' most invigorating work precisely because of all the avenues of projection its fascinating obliqueness provides.",
            "Haynes does to us what his film does to Carol, cannily exploiting our willingness to find answers where there are none, to read meaning into associations.",

            "One of the all-time great films. Screams out with existential terror showcasing how the lack of identity is not only anxiety-inducing but potentially inevitable due to the modern world we live in.",
            "In many ways, 'Safe' predicts both the insular nature of contemporary society, and the (counter-intuitive) disease of conformity that's synonymous with it.",
            " For all its disquiet, Safe is truly about the terror of losing control-or, even more frightening, being made aware of the fact that we never had control to begin with.",

            "With anti-star boldness, Moore doesn't so much embody the role as disembody it, dissolving before our eyes.",
            "Frequently fascinating, it never builds into anything profound.",
            "Safe is numbingly fascinating, partly due to its carefully composed, antiseptic visual style and its throbbingly threatening soundtrack.",

            "Beautifully constructed, chilling internal nightmare where every scene plays out like a little mini movie in and of itself. Brilliant.",
            "Like Carol, this gifted filmmaker seems to be trapped inside a shell -- devoting his considerable intelligence mainly to justifying his own sense of paralysis.",

            "Like its source material, the movie is stylish, profane, intelligent, and eminently diverting. But as much as it is a delight that Dominik has disinterred Higgins's work, it is a mild disappointment that the result is not more substantial.",
            "Trading in pleasures of a deliberately rarefied sort, writer-director Andrew Dominik's talky, character-rich genre piece largely short-circuits thrills to sketch a grimly funny portrait of thugs taking care of business, in every rotten sense of the word.",

            "Sometimes its violence is ultraheightened, disgustingly real. Other times it's so stylized as to be barely felt.",

            "The weakest part of this film is the ferocious government PR chief, played by Kristin Scott Thomas, with much lip-pursing and eye-rolling, but nothing funny or believable in the script for her to say.",
            "The kind of film you might find on the DVD shelf of a holiday cottage, and that's not necessarily a criticism.",
            "The preachiness - about \"faith\" - gets so thick that the film completely loses all its early zingy lightness of touch.",
            "Too light for its own good.",
            "The stars are endearing enough to keep things tolerable, though you may wonder why even McGregor's Scots brogue sounds artificially sweetened here.",

            "Everything that happens is horribly predictable, and the tone varies from light and fluffy to over-the-top camp, especially with Kristin Scott Thomas as the cynical British press secretary.",
            "Faith, serenity, dreams, possibilities, duty and honor, love . . . and fishing. \"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\" somehow ties them all together, and without so much as a kink in the line.",

            "Hitchcock does noteworthy disservices to the master.",
            "Watching Hitchcock pitch his story to the press and bicker with executives and censors is amusing and sobering at the same time, ",
            "Anyone wanting to learn about the real Hitchcock will be disappointed - although Hopkins does get a gold star for a tongue-in-cheek impersonation of Alfred.",

            "Kitano's considerable gifts as a screenwriter and stylist-namely, his talent for staging violent outbursts and conveying narrative through elliptical cuts-are enough to sustain the film as a twisty, cynical underworld yarn.",
            "\"Beyond Outrage\" fails to live up to its title as Japanese superstar Takeshi Kitano can't find much in the way of fresh ideas for the genre.",

            "The strategy and strategizing of \"Beyond Outrage\" ... feel like overkill (if you'll pardon the expression).",
            "The narrative haze clears eventually, and the action-dialogue ratio balances out with a succession of swift, punchy setpieces.",
            "At its best, it's a Yakuza film that stays true to the concept by injecting more gunfights, simple characters, dark humor, and a heavily bloody plotline. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "The tension between the past and the future leads to lots and lots of brilliantly edited (the genius of the movie) violence. In the end, no one loses and no one wins",
            "Another cash-grab that unfortunately wears its cheapness on its sleeve.",
            "What prevails throughout Beyond Outrage is a rigorous, downbeat classicism.",
            "Plays like a movie made for Takeshi devotees and super fans of the genre at the expense of everyone else.",
            "The movie as a whole feels cynical and exhausted.",

            "An overlong and overly intricate but effective yakuza thriller, with Takeshi Kitano & Co. all in fine, furious form. ",
            "When it comes to yakuza cinema, you can do better.",
            "Beyond Outrage is the very sort of tiresome tough-guy retread that, with 2007's meta drama Glory to the Filmmaker! and 2008's darkly comic Achilles and the Tortoise, Kitano seemed to have outgrown.",
            "If Takeshi Kitano does go forward with the rumored third volume, hopefully he'll conceive of some fresh angle on this increasingly dry material.",
            "Beyond Outrage is an effective deconstruction of the yakuza crime thriller that withholds the genre's usual thrills but retains a sense of humor. The result is a film that's thoughtful and affecting, even if it is a little slow at times."

            "Tarantino accomplishes what he set out to do, make a fun, violent, badass spaghetti western. He brings together the classic aesthetics of the genre, with his modern, pop culture saturated sensibilities, and his whip smart dialogue. ",

            "On the surface, Django Unchained is your standard revenge fairy tale, but it has a mean streak that enhances every aspect of the experience. Equal parts electrifying and hard to watch, its joyously liberating ending sticks the explosive landing",

            "Narrative issues hold In the House back from being as great as it should be.",
            "The convoluted yet familiar narrative games become somewhat tiresome. The movie works best as a straight suspense drama about a frustrated teacher and his devious star pupil...",
            "The result is one of those stories about storytelling that have become something of a post-modern specialty of elevated art. Ozon manages a light touch, however, so that Dans La Maison never feels too self-referential.",
            "As a black comedy, this never quite catches fire, though there is some mild amusement to be found in its social satire.",
            "Has the slow-pulsing vertigo of a psychological thriller & the twists of an elaborate melodrama, but to reduce it to these labels is glib. Caustic & funny but never misanthropic. A study of the ways people actually live, rather than how we assume they do.",
            "These characters are messed up and yet there I was, sitting in the back row of the cinema, with a smile on my face.",

            "Occasionally too clever for its own good, the film may go one step too far, but Ozon manages the hybrid of genres beautifully and ultimately it is his superb cast that sells the nuances and the concept"

            "More than the trite set-up, Friends with Kids' biggest travesty is a criminal waste of professional funny people like Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph.",
            "Sharp enough to appreciate, with Westfeldt and Adam Scott anchoring a really good cast.",
            "Friends with Kids is simply not very funny. The few laughs there are come from the bickering O'Dowd and Rudolph, but even their shtick is clich\u00e9d and obvious.",

            "All in all, this is a smart, charming and endearing film.",
            "Blending Jennifer Westfeldt's talky, observational style with the kind of irreverent humour that helped Bridesmaids bridge the gender divide, Friends With Kids explores love, marriage and child-rearing with gusto and wit.",
            "A strong support cast (featuring Bridesmaids trio Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph and Chris O'Dowd) are just as amusing as the leads.",
            "Blends the disparate tones---dirty, sweet, funny and flailing---into a largely compelling, wholly watchable modern movie.",

            "Surprisingly funny and wickedly smart, this romantic dramedy soars.",
            "As she did with her first script, the gender-bending 'Kissing Jessica Stein,' Westfeldt goes for something radical and winds up pulling her punches when things start getting interesting. ",

            "Movies of this genre normally want you to root for the couple to end up together. All this one had me doing was hoping that someone would smack them upside the head and talk some sense into them.",

            "As ever, without a funny script, Carell looks and sounds like the world's creepiest serial killer.",
            "Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is as insufferable as its title.",
            "A failed attempt to mix genres, made worse by a lot of misplaced schmaltz.",
            "Though it's clear we're meant to be moved by the big finale, the sight of these two together is so unsettling it's hard not to start rooting for the asteroid.",
            "Seeking a Friend for the End of the World sought but never found a cineplex audience. Even so, I would personally advise that you add it to your queue of movies to see before the asteroid hits.",
            "Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is a film that just about works. The emphasis here is on 'just about', however.",
            "With uneven laughs, sensitivity and bittersweetness in one tidy package, Seeking A Friend For The End Of The World is a credible directorial debut for Scafaria but it only becomes watchable after the first 45 mins.",
            "A jagged contraption of a narrative that never finds a comfortable or credible rhythm. ",
            "Scafaria retools modern trappings with old formulas for mostly enjoyable effect. Just as long as you don't look at it too intently. Under close examination, you may recoil in disgust.",
            "This convoluted rompocalypse seems unsure of what it really is, or indeed aspires to be.",
            "With her debut as director, [director Lorene] Scafaria has created something really unique.",
            "The romance plays like a studio note and you barely believe it, but the movie wrapped around it is so watchable that you can let it be. This one last time.",
            "How you feel about this movie may depend on whether you believe that Keira Knightley has a thing for John Cale.",
            "That's where the brilliance of the film clicks in: What these characters are facing isn't all that different from the human prospect in general.",
            "It's a genre-defying melancomedy that manages to be good science fiction and a moving romance at the same time. Best of all, it never cheats you with false optimism about the fate of the world.",
            "Could there be a more opportune time for this topic? Will that pack 'em in the theaters? Not likely. It's hectic while lacking tension, thus paradoxically ending up both irritating and boring simultaneously.",
            "Carell could have given the performance of his life (he doesn't), and the film would have remained a clich\u00e9-ridden mess with a narrative built on convenience and coincidence.",
            "There's an entire world out there that's about to end, and this movie zooms in on the two least interesting people in it.",
            "Carell possesses a knack for these comedic-tinged dramatic parts, subtly layering on the pathos while slyly exploiting his character's vulnerability.",
            "A certain generosity of spirit is required here, but the performances are excellent and the central premise ... is a solid and amusing one. ",
            "Seeking a Friend mocks the modern rom-com formula, but its apocalyptic gags soon give way to a heart-breaking love story.",
            "'Seeking a Friend for the End of the World' is funny, but also profound and tragic."

            "Narrowness of focus keeps the movie from becoming bloated with self-importance, but it also leaves it feeling a little inconsequential-more of a pleasing snack than a satisfying meal.",
            "Vincent seems to have consciously designed Haute Cuisine as a small movie...But that simplicity is a winning choice.",
            "When a movie's high-stakes moment is whether a cream cheese should be considered dessert, it's hard not to motion for the check.",

            "Vastly superior to Mirror, Mirror in every way. Great work from Charlize Theron.",
            "For a creaky old fairy tale considered by many to be past its bedtime story prime, this Snow White turns out to be much, much better than expected.",

            "A film that succeeds somewhat by not trying to be anything it's not. ",
            "What you take away from this dark film, filled with several twisted characters and twisty turns, is a great deal of nicely-crafted atmosphere, and a terrific performance from Charlize Theron as the evil stepmother. ",
            "The superb cinematography and art direction deserve praise, but they could shorten the middle part of the story.",
            "Is this tale a commentary on how women often feel used for nothing more than their beauty and therefore chose to think of it as power? Good try.",
            "At times resembles a multi-million dollar perfume ad set in a fantastical, medieval-inflected world. Yet the central performances shine through and there is just enough humour.",

            "This is what happens when faerie tales are taken for the explorations of the human game that they truly are.",
            "Snow White and the Huntsman takes the ageless fable, and makes it dark and exhausting.",
            " For all its flaws - and there are more of them than in Charlize \"Evil Queen\" Theron's magically aged face - Snow White delivers exactly what you expect from a fairy tale. And more.",
            "Overall, I enjoyed Huntsman thought it was a good first effort from [director Rupert] Sanders, though pacing and some lazy narrative devices dragged it down a bit.",
            "One had hoped for better. ",
            "Not a perfect movie by any stretch of the imagination, Snow White and the Huntsman can boast truly magnificent performances--minus Stewart, of course--an interesting take on a beloved tale, and gorgeous scenes. Too bad about some of that plot though."

            "Walter Salles' adaptation of ON THE ROAD is an intoxicating but frustrating film. You will be drawn in by the visual and aural hedonism and you'll ignore the self-indulgence and lack of control - but only up to a point.",
            "On The Road takes you on a visual and emotionally visceral experience of freedom and freedom of expression.",
            "Salles has been on this road before with much more success, and this trip just feels gratuitous, lost in its own haze of beatnik navel gazing.",
            "In its base remit of offering a visual realisation of the story and honouring the key themes of the novel and Beat culture, Salles deserves at least a modicum of credit.",

            "[Director Walter] Salles gets the frenetic pace of Beat Generation antics right, but he only hints at Sal's ambivalence about this way of living.",
            "The performances are a key element to enjoying this picture, but it remains slow and sometimes uneventful.",

            "Kristin Stewart reminded me of why I liked her in the first place, in movies like \"Into the Wild.\" Quiet and natural is more her thing, and she was seductive and believable and also oft-nude here.",
            "With On The Road, Salles creates a vivid portrait of youth and spirited abandon that probably won't resonate with everyone. But then again, the best movies seldom do.",
            "More an extended Urban Outfitters advertisement than an essay on, or into, the exciting experiments of Beat Cinema. ",
            "While the film revolves around painfully handsome Dean's chaotic existentialism, the women of On the Road, while often discarded by their men, provide essential narrative stability and insight.",
            "Although the film is sensationally photographed and artfully directed and scored, it's ultimately strictly dullsville, man. ",
            "Despite the obvious enthusiasm of the screenwriter, the director, and the actors for Kerouac's novel, they get it wrong. Probably nobody can get it right, since the power is in the words, not the story.",

            "As a documentary, \"Searching for Sugar Man\" falls short, but as an enormously satisfying feel-good story it hits the mark."

            "[Philippe] Falardeau's unobtrusive direction, and the restrained performance of Fellag and the child actors, make this a powerful, unsentimental film that doesn't make you feel like you're hearing a lecture.",
            "It rarely diverges from the template, but it's a particularly modest, intelligent and moving film.",
            "lowly enveloping you in its pace, this is a film you never want to end.",

            "While it does not hang together as a whole, Farewell, My Queen is still an interesting and engaging film that should be overall commended for what it does achieve.",
            "It's kind of the Rosencrantz and Gulidenstern Are Dead approach to history, observing it from the perspective of a \"minor character\", and it works ... it's a fascinating glimpse of a moment in history from, essentially, a safe bystander.",
            "A strangely mixed film, sliding from intimate scenes of royal indolence to muted panic in candlelit corridors, a distinct undercurrent of detached uncertainty always present in both story and style.",
            "A mood of melancholy and the film is beautifully lit and shot. But there's something missing in the telling and its often disjointed structure mitigates against the emotional satisfaction we are seeking",
            "Visually sumptuous, this French Spanish co-production about the last days of Marie Antoinette is a far cry from Sofia Coppola's 2006 lollypop version"

            "The convoluted final act may test the patience of the uninitiated, but in every other respect this atypical Hindi heartwarmer deserves international breakout success."

            "Its last five minutes are so extraordinarily enigmatic, you're certain the subject of innocence, guilt and attraction has been addressed on a deep level.",
            "A nuanced kitchen-sink depiction of an Israeli Hassidic community which zeroes in on the dilemma of an 18-year-old girl named Shira.",
            "This is an extraordinary first film, nerve-tingling in its intensity, and assembled with a finesse and control even the great Austrian director Michael Haneke might envy.",
            "Beautiful and mysterious, the[se] first glimpses are an ideal primer for the Israeli film, which never rushes to spell out the meanings of its subtle and quiet moments.",
            "While Burshtein does offer up that sense of reverence and communal commitment, she doesn't idealize the community and isn't afraid to show the more business aspects of Purim.",
            "Steeped in tradition, religion and ritual, Fill The Void fills a void in cinema with warmth and insight into the mysteries of love and life.",
            "Almost all of the film's characters are so well-rounded, and their personal and moral nagging so well-defined, that every single shot feels full of life and vitality. Most commendable of all, Burshtein treats her subject with delicacy.",
            "For better or worse, Burshtein elides a specific critique of the religious ideology that has forced Shira into marriage in the first place.",
            "Fill the Void is an astonishing film, a masterful piece of art that feels like the work of an established veteran but is instead the debut of a woman who, like the married women in her film, sees her family as the center of her life.",
            "[Rama] Burshtein oppressively captures the claustrophobia of a close-knit community where every daily act - from opening a door to eating - is a religious ritual.",
            "Burhstein's slow-paced, carefully edited work illuminates concepts of filial piety, female agency, and patriarchy.",
            "It's not a great movie, but it's a humane and touching one.",
            "Emotional issues an an insular world",
            "A man and a woman, alone, on a path at night, forbidden to touch, speak, confront, describe passion: the man moves closer. That's all. The smallest of moves, infinitesimal motion. The world tilts on its axis.",
            "...an entertaining yet uneven debut from a promising new filmmaker...",
            "As opposed to the bleak view of sexual subjugation in Kadosh, Amos Gitai's 1999 film about Hasidic marriage, Fill the Void sees Burshtein fortrightly and wittily asserting that this is how her community lives.",
            "A rare and illuminating glimpse of contemporary Hasidic life against the backdrop of ritual, Purim, marriage, and death.",
            "Few films in recent memory better capture the heartbreak of loss, the agony of indecision or the burden of familial duty.",
            "An intelligent and moving examination of the possibilities of personal freedom within the strict confines of religion and tradition.",
            "A fascinating and emotionally gripping drama with a sharply written, understated script and a pair of terrific performances from Hadas Yaron and Yiftach Klein.",
            "With honesty and sensitivity, this Israeli drama takes us into an unfamiliar subcuture, letting us experience aspects of life in an Orthodox Jewish community that we've probably never even imagined before.",
            "A warm, watchful slant on marital mores in an ultraorthodox Jewish community."

            "This vacant, misshapen film is basically an extended beer commercial that presents the world as a ludicrous place populated by sex-and-cash-and-booze-crazed zomboids. Cruise, meanwhile, comes off as a somewhat taller Spuds MacKenzie.",
            "Cocktail kicks off with an entertainingly lighthearted opening stretch revolving around Brian's initial entry into the world of bartending...",
            "Cocktail is a vacuous throwback to Saturday Night Fever -- without the cultural novelty. The script is spiked with some comic lines, but overproof doses of inadvertent humor kill the effect.",
            "As if realizing that his star hasn't smiled for 15 minutes, Donaldson tacks on a goody-goody ending that would shame the Care Bears. How to sum up what went wrong? Cruise has a line in the movie: \"Flat beer from rusty pipes.\"",
            "Ultimately, the ideas in this film fall as flat as stale beer and honest emotions are as watered down as cheap whiskey. This Cocktail is definitely on the rocks.",
            "Cocktail is so steeped in corn, the drama seems comedic and the comedy is about as funny as a hangover.",

            "Ono may be the center of this universe, but the real star of the film is the sushi, and the exquisite yet frustrating beauty with which the camera has captured it.",
            "Gelb also provides an education on the different kinds of sushi, the purveyors of premium fish and rice, and overfishing. But it's his lyrical, lovingly photographed scenes of preparation that elevates the documentary to a work of art.",

            "The recent rediscovery of silent film is unfortunately more of a casual awakening than a complete rebirth, although Blancanieves may be the finest example of it yet.",
            "Filmed in glamorous black and white, all dialogue furnished via intertitles, the movie is less a pastiche than The Artist and, at least initially, it's not as precious. ",

            "Loving, willful anachronism... silent black-and-white fairytale Blancanieves-\"a local film for a global market\"-retells the familiar tale against a backdrop of bullfighting and flamenco in 1920s Seville, with intermittent roosters and dwarfs.",
            "A Spanish take on Snow White that picks up where The Artist left off and shows the full elegance of silent filmmaking.",
            "Blancanieves is a truly stunning motion picture, the kind of movie that makes you glad the movies exist.",
            "Shooting in crisp black-and-white and with sparse dialogue (on title cards), Berger creates gorgeous scenes that evoke not only the silent era but early '30s horror (including a reference to Tod Browning's Freaks that's oddly endearing). ",
            "Berger plays Blancanieves like a game, very carefully monitoring the mood and heightening it or lowering it as needs be.",
            "Blancanieves is fun, funny, and beautiful to look at, with a genuinely surprising and moving ending.",
            "Far from an arthouse gimmick, Blancanieves marries style and story in a way that seems so obvious and fitting that it's a wonder why this film hadn't been made before.",
            "It oddly looks like a cross between a Guy Maddin and Tod Browning flick, one that couldn't keep its straight silent pic pretense without shooting for something more modern."

            "The Australian director Cate Shortland has made a quite stunning film about the collapse of Nazi Germany, seen not from a Berlin bunker but through the eyes of a 14-year-old girl.",
            "The young principals here, Malina and especially Rosendahl, are superb at conveying that premature hardening, their elastic minds pummelled by inelastic forces.",
            "The sins of the Fatherland send a German teenage girl and her Nazi-connected family on the run in Australian director Cate Shortland's vividly rendered and sensual drama Lore.",
            "With a child's perspective on war, \"Lore\" deserves comparisons with \"Empire of the Sun\" and \"Hope and Glory,\" and with a feisty female protagonist it stands virtually alone.",
            "Although there are moments that push the story a bit beyond credulity, Shortland has created something remarkable by forcing us to find within ourselves sympathy for this would-be Aryan princess.",
            "A film you simply don't want to miss.",
            "Cate Shortland's tough, moving film is shot with great intimacy, driving home the idea that great horrors are ultimately a personal responsibility.",
            "Shortland has created a moving, intriguing and complex film, which provides one of the most intelligent and honest approaches to both Nazism and the holocaust seen on screen in recent years.",
            " A raw, urgent yet contemplative tone infuses every moment and, courtesy of cinematographer Adam Arkapaw, Shortland uses the country's foggy, murky landscape to stunning effect.",
            "The portrait that emerges proves, above all else, one of resilience and adaptability.",
            "Lore's textures and colors evoke equal parts wonder and horror.",
            "Remarkable. Raw, disorienting and it never bothers to tell you what it can instead show.",
            "Cate Shortland infuses a fresh perspective and a haunting moral quandary to the WWII genre, bringing a little seen part of human history to chilling life.",
            "Rosendahl puts the onslaught of horror and absurdity in poignant perspective with her limpid depiction of her character's growing resourcefulness and awareness.",
            "Lore is a akin to a bourgeois German version of Elem Klimov's 1985 Belarus-set Come and See, and it has some outstanding features. The star turn is the lurking cinematography of Adam Arkapaw.",
            "The deep-feeling Rosendahl makes a major impression as an intelligent girl learning the power of her sexuality and resolve under maximum stress.",
            "Shortland may not leave us with certainty, but in the context of so bloody a conflict fueled by intransigence and misguided idealism, the hope and the beauty of Lore is only strengthened by its embrace of youthful uncertainty.",
            "The dream of every director tasked with bringing such a difficult story to life is to have a star who can carry the drama, and in her feature debut, Rosendahl is a revelation.",
            "The bleak backdrop is rendered with great beauty-so much so that perhaps the sensory poetics of the visuals linger beyond their darker implications.",
            "It's this mature take on the subject matter that makes Lore the finest Australian film of the year.",
            "We see no fighting and no high-level participants -- just ordinary people before a backdrop of natural beauty and manmade horror.",
            "With an eye for images that are both lush and foreboding, Cate Shortland dives confidently into a moral minefield and doesn't care about defusing the situation. ",
            "One could have made a much more didactic film with the same story - German girl learns Jews aren't so bad after all! - but Shortland is after something much more elliptical here. "

            "Darkly funny as it is, the movie has undercurrents of genuine and very British weirdness.",
            " The film is a violent, hallucinatory Bonnie and Clyde story, tracing two youngish lovers on a gory rampage across the countryside. This film just proves once again that Wheatley has zero regard for convention.",
            "Initially sweet and good natured, only to become disturbing yet laugh-out-loud funny, Sightseers is a dark treat. ",
            "Fantastic black comedy, burnt like toast. Unfilled expectations and the need to be loved turn into a hilariously horrific caravan trip for two strange lovebirds.",
            "There are few directors out there who can achieve the appropriate balance between horrific violence and laugh-out-loud comedy, but Wheatley's masterful touch makes this a consistently enjoyable.",
            "Wheatley's control has never seemed greater, the music cues, the deft editing by Wheatley, Amy Jump and Robin Hill and the performances all so sharp that the film is allowed to be viewed properly as the gem that it is.",
            "It's hard to quibble with Sightseers, and its satirical, observational eye is spot on, mining to laser-like effect hitherto underdocumented subjects in British comedy cinema.",
            "At last, a really well-scripted and well-directed, funny British comedy.",
            "Mr. Wheatley doesn't trust his viewers to get the point and spends most of the movie picking the same scab.",
            "Not only is Sightseers a relishable achievement for its devisers, Lowe and Oram, but it enhances Wheatley's reputation as currently the most refreshingly offbeat and unpredictable director of British crime movies.",
            "The filmmaker's sense of humor is deadpan, but it might work better in the format of a half-hour sitcom.",
            "Here, Britishness is the horror. And that's really scary.",
            "A must for cult connoisseurs who take their comedy strong and dark. ",
            "Sightseers is everything you could want from a dark comedy infused with horror and is by far Wheatley's most assured work to date.",
            "It has a levity and self-aware absurdity that makes it not only a different kind of beast, but also another film that marks Ben Wheatley as a young director to keep an eye on.",
            "The film is certainly funny, but the laughs aren't as constant as you'd hope from a film like this.",
            "Uncomfortably lurching from broad slapstick to dark and sharp gore - often in the space of a single scene - Sightseers adds up to a rather jumbled whole, despite the punchlines hitting as often as they miss.",
            "Devised by acting-writing comedy team Lowe and Oram and co-scripted by Amy Jump, director Ben Wheatley's professional and personal partner, the movie pokes fun at the social limitations of these lumpen Midlanders without sneering at or patronizing them.",
            "An undeniable treat for lovers of morbid comedy."

            "A fascinating film.",

            "This attempt at a drama is pretty routine, but it demonstrates why some clich\u00e9s became clich\u00e9s: because they work. [It's] basically The Bad News Bears without all of the humor, though the tone is still fairly light. ",

            "If you can't guess where these \"Crooked Arrows\" are going, you aren't getting out enough. But Routh is wonderfully light and laid back here, perhaps thanks to the low stakes this tiny film has.",

            "Although it adheres to the tried-and-true sports-movie formula of an underdog team striving to overcome their limitations to become winners, Crooked Arrows lacks captivating emotional momentum.",
            "The connection between the sport and tribal traditions is compelling, but eventually the film drowns amid a slew of underdog cliches.",
            "Authentic and uplifting, it's a feel-good, family movie.",
            "While 'Crooked Arrows' certainly isn't a good film by any objective standard, it has a good heart, and proves far more tolerable than many blockbuster sports movies.",

            "The late, great Diana Vreeland devoted her youth to reinventing herself-and her life-to redefine how the world sees beauty. While she may not have become a swan, she became something much more opulent and grand. A peacock, perhaps. ",
            "The limits placed on Immordino Vreeland by a presumed family obligation and her subject's superstructure persona create a fascinating narrative tension in an otherwise admirably executed but boilerplate personality piece.",

            "...more of an energetic and affectionate sketch than a revealing portrait of this oversized personality, but one has to wonder if the woman who celebrated glittering surfaces would have wanted it any other way. ",

            "It is pretentious and overbearing at times but passionate.",

            "the concept was rife with possibilities that could synergize with Graynor's fresh appeal as well as her rising-star status. Neither the possibilities nor the synergy happens, mainly due to an underdeveloped story.",

            "Colourful direction and sparky performances help make this friendship comedy watchable, although it never seems like a finished film.",
            "The film keeps trying to be filthy and outrageous, but is actually rather timid.",
            "What saves this ultimately charming indie... from its inescapable sitcomishness and an over-reliance on some tired stereotypes is that it does manage genuine cuteness in a realm that has enormous potential to be icky and crude.",
            "Ari Graynor and Lauren Anne Miller are great as the sassy pair and despite a veneer of sex, in truth the film is more about friendship.",
            "Transcends the more pat aspects of its story, connecting in fun fashion by sheer force of personality.",
            "Earns points for focusing on the central female friendship and for its refreshingly frank and breezy attitude to sex, though it's slightly let down by a late-arriving plot development that fails to fully convince.",
            "Think American Pie (without the sight gags) meets Sex and the City (without the gloss) and you've got this, a girls-on-top comedy that's all spit and no polish."

            "Although the themes of clueless rich kids acting boorishly are very much the same as in Stillman's biggest hits, 'Metropolitan' and 'Barcelona,' the light and breezy \"Damsels\" more than stands on its own as an Austen-tatious delight.",
            "Why he would once again focus his imagination on another ensemble of shallow, self-absorbed characters that are all directed to speak like they were born in the same upper-class Connecticut suburb indicates a one-track mind, at the least.",

            "And while it occasionally feels a little wobbly, it grows more sure of itself and richer as it goes along.",

            "It's just unfortunate that Dark Shadows' impressive cast is not backed up with tighter material. With hints towards a possible sequel suggested, whether Burton has earned the right to make it after this average effort is definitely up for debate.",
            "Burton is a master of black comedy whose attention to detail makes for films full of wonder.",

            "Has some good footage but is more Disney-anthropomorphic than Attenborough-authentic.",
            "Like the real-life natural-world Disney features of yesteryear, there's a huge amount of entertainment to be had, especially for kids, although the imposition of a story and the attribution of various emotions to the creatures can get slightly cloying.",

            "An engaging, beautifully shot wildlife drama with undeniably cute subjects, but you can't help wishing the film had probed a bit deeper into meerkat society.",
            "Contains plenty of high drama thanks to some judicious editing and cutting-edge camera work and it avoids sentimentalising nature too much by showing death on screen and weaving in a subtle environmental message."

            "There's nothing revolutionary going on here, but LIBERAL ARTS will speak wittily to certain audiences with an enjoyable clarity and resonance.",
            "All in all, Liberal Arts is more than above average with a nice take on nostalgic romanticism, filled with sweetness, charm and a lot of wisdom.",
            "Credit is due to Radnor for assembling a strong supporting cast... but sadly his second outing behind the camera falls foul of many of the deadly sins committed by indie Sundance fodder past and present.",
            "Radnor has a wisdom beyond his still-young years, and a talent for communicating it.",
            "This film is one of the rare exceptions to the rule. Yes, it's romantic; and yes, it's funny, but it's also a layered, thoughtful look at the meaning of coming-of-age.",
            "There's nothing predictable about the way the romance unfolds. ",
            "Liberal Arts seems aggressively cheery, determinedly lacking in negativity, and very affirming in its protagonist's masculine heroism. None of it is a surprise, and as a result, not much of it is very good, either.",
            "Romantic comedies don't set out to change your life, but Liberal Arts does provide an easy and enjoyable study on growing up and finding contentment, whatever your age.",
            "Liberal Arts is a resolutely vanilla-flavored concoction but still pleasant, amiable, and a little more thoughtful than your average rom-com.",
            "An exuberant, heartfelt concoction, the kind of sunny comedy that's good for the soul.",
            "Some of the insights are a bit simplistic but for most of the running time, the film is an enjoyable diversion. ",

            "If you long for the bleak intelligence of an Ingmar Bergman film, where humankind is deeply flawed and God is indifferently silent and the landscape is cloaked in perpetual winter, then Beyond the Hills promises to be your cup of despair.",
            "There are no easy villains or heroes in this sad and slow but forcefully told tale, which exhibits the same humanity Mungiu brought to 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days, his abortion drama that won the 2007 Palme d'Or.",

            "Mungiu's Beyond the Hills delicately explores a highly controversial, contemporary subject with the care and intelligence that it necessitates. ",
            "The film's greatest strength is its constant insistence on ambiguity. Almost nothing is explicit and as a result, everything the viewer thinks, feels and judges is based on inference, allusion and their own prejudices and convictions.",

            "The skillful handling of such radical yet delicate material in the film's final act is quite a sight to see.",
            "A profound and bruising study of a country whose long-suffering inhabitants are cowed into incommunication by various forms of repressive dictatorship, it's another muted triumph from director Cristian Mungiu.",

            "It's a satisfying story, played out in decorous period surroundings of the classic warrior tale but Yamada's 79th film lacks any hint of surprise or excitement.",
            "The storytelling is all rather flat, as is the lighting. And the duel, when it finally comes, is something of an anticlimax.",
            "A fervent, sweet-natured tragic romance.",
            "A very satisfying tale that emphasizes one of the genre's key themes: The deepest wound a samurai may suffer does not come from any blade.",
            "An impeccably made classic Japanese period picture in which a nobility of spirit is tested amid the most beautiful of settings, revealing the harshness and hypocrisy of a feudal society of the utmost formality and rigidity.",
            "It's an exquisitely crafted melodrama, moving with stately grace toward an understated yet forceful quest for revenge.",
            "Unites Ozu and Kurosawa's cinema. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Tradition, love and intimacy are intertwined in the beautiful Japanese film Love and Honor. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "the movie has only one sword fight, and it consists of only three or four swings of the blade, but don't let that dissuade you. You won't be bored.",
            "Feudal honour is challenged by love with overwhelming consequences. Even die hard Zatoichi-ites will admire the deftness of Yamada's masterly direction.",
            "Intricate, artfully constructed and utterly assured, Love And Honour is essential viewing for anyone who has seen Yamada's earlier samurai films. If you haven't, don't miss the chance to see what is a finely tuned example of the genre.",
            "Gently paced and delicately played, give this long enough and it becomes a compelling watch that eventually rewards any moral aspirations with a splendid Zatoichi-style scrap that manages to stay its welcome.",
            "The third in director Yoji Yamada's Samurai Trilogy is an enjoyable, well acted drama, with a superb climactic swordfight and a plot that seems to have been lifted straight out of Hollywood melodrama.",
            "Veteran director Yamada continues to examine issues of duty and loyalty, sharply using matter-of-fact period detail and deep characterisations.",
            "dyskoleyetai na kratisei ypo elegho toys melodramatismoys tis, kai sto deytero miso tis se krataei men me sfigmena ta heria ap' tin agonia, katorthoma, omos, poy den eimai sigoyros oti einai kai toso dyskolo, otan s' ehei paei os ekei me ta sagonia tentom",
            "Final installment in samurai trilogy that features a blind swordsman in an utterly distinct fashion from the Zatoichi movies--a far more vulnerable and far more believable hero.",
            "Thanks to its focus on internal struggle and domestically confined drama, Love and Honor is the wilting lily of Yamada's trilogy, albeit an exceptionally satisfying romance.",
            "Gracefully directed, deliberately paced and intentionally free of the action you'd expect from a samurai film, all of which makes its climactic confrontation that much more effective.",
            "The film is void of action until a final duel that is staged with a believability that makes the supernatural skill displayed in most blind swordsman films seem preposterous.",
            "Love and Honor is a welcome affirmation of Yamada's determination to maintain his historic workload, even while in his 70s.",
            "Might work as a short story but as a full-length makes for a long, slow round of watch-checking."

            "The quiet time that Johann and Anne spend during museum hours -- and after his shifts on trips around the city -- offer solace in their mutual solitude. Museum Hours is an introverted companion for its viewers.",
            "The two leads contribute fresh, genuine performances, and what might have been a musty academic exercise gains in tension from Cohen's deft juxtaposing of vocal narration, character detail, and majestic artwork.",
            "It's as if Cohen had lived for centuries among these places, and sometimes with art that encapsulates these centuries, and is pleasantly imprisoned within its strength.",
            "It has its tedium, but it's not bad. At times, it's actually quite good.",
            "Subtle in its emotional grounding and profound in its ability to harness art history to question the world's current relationship with it, Museum Hours is nothing less than a brilliant film. ",
            "The film's effect is much like a an actual visit to a museum, a stiff whiff of cultural pretense that becomes a sense of quiet awe and wonder.",
            "[A] sublime and quietly engrossing exploration of the power of art to bind people together across the ages.",
            "Cohen examines the skill of looking-looking at art, looking at film, looking at the world around you. He observes the art, and we observe his art, watching intently as he films intently.",
            "Museum Hours offers neither a city symphony nor a love story but a serenely eccentric way of looking. ",
            "Cohen has balanced both the head and heart, producing a serene quality that feels like a lazy Sunday afternoon strolling off the streets into an art gallery.",
            "\"Kunsthistorisches. It's the big old one.\"... neatly sums up the film's warm, casual attitude toward weighty cultural institutions while serving as a way of reframing formerly perceived paragons of elitism in a more democratic manner.",
            "Emotion is often considered the enemy by experimental filmmakers, but Cohen's films depend on it.",
            "When Cohen's film is over and the lights go out, the world is not the same anymore.",
            "A Chris Marker kind of exceptional experimental film that sets its sights on observing art, the landscape, people, Vienna and our sense of being.",
            "Cohen's simple, masterful film considers how we anoint value.",
            "...encourages you to see the aesthetic potential of everything around you, including each frame that appears on the screen.",
            "This goes on for more than two hours and will bore some viewers to death. Others, though, will find this quiet, complex film a fascinating piece of art in itself.",
            "Great art has the power to comment on life's issues - sex, death, parenthood, religion, etc. - and Cohen uses the power of the still image to construct a film of moving ones with power of its own.",
            "As we learn how to look at the Kunsthistorisches' masterpieces, we're also learning how to watch this movie. ... And better: we're learning how to look at our lives.",
            "Museum Hours is one of those artsy-fartsy meditations on life that you see sometimes in the better cinemas. The good news is it turns out to be more artsy than fartsy: There's plenty to think about here.",
            "Calm entertainment.",
            "Most successful at its most hushed and explicitly 'artful,' in the museum; less interesting when it becomes more casual, as when Johann and Mary hang out and discuss general topics at coffeehouses. (Mary is nice, but, frankly, a bit of a bore.) "

            "\"In Another Country\" is a delightful comedy that shows Huppert's ability to play characters who aren't obsessive neurotics or dangerously sexually frustrated, as in films like Denis' \"White Material\" or Michael Haneke's \"The Piano Teacher.",
            "...Huppert's character is a social flaneur who, whether she knows it or not, searches for guidance in others, the world around her and ultimately in herself in order to find a response, an intentional act taken in conscious responsibility. ",
            "An effective comedy where the laughs don't come from farts or slapstick humor, but from everyday situations. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Hong embraces the power of fiction both to reflect reality and to reflect upon itself, and, in doing so, once again shows why he's one of the most important directors working today.",
            "An intriguing little cross-cultural curio that plays like a woozy, jazz-improv riff on romantic futility and destiny.",
            " Isabelle Huppert has an inviting, steady glow in Hong Sang-soo's loosey-goosey, humorously light celebration of the French star, cinema's possibilities, and his colorful, endlessly combative homeland.",
            "The cumulative impression is of figures being lightly traced in the sand only to be inevitably washed away, intentionally ephemeral and quite charming for it.",
            "It's a fairly banal comment on foreign estrangement (or love) that could have used some roughing up.",
            "Hong Sang-soo hits the beach once again in his latest project, another austerely amusing study of hopeless neurotics making a mockery of leisure.",
            "An arty, though not particularly artful, experiment",
            "Hong Sang-soo's intricate new comedy of broken romance reaches exquisite heights of self-mocking pathos, painterly finesse, and symbolic density.",
            "Hong has fun zooming, panning, and toying with structure and narrative repetition, though the film doesn't have the powerful undercurrent of regret typical of his best work.",

            "Regardless of its problems, this was still a fun movie, with good dialogue and some nice supporting work. It won't change the world, but honestly, it doesn't need to.",
            "There's fun action throughout and a solidly constructed puzzle to solve. It's not great, but it's sufficiently entertaining as it goes. ",
            "Jack Reacher is a solid, whodunit mystery that will keep you entertained.",
            "As far as guilty pleasures go, Jack Reacher is surprisingly smarter than most.",
            "The film has a very 70's feel to it, reminiscent of classics like Bullit or The French Connection.",
            "Piles on action hero cliches with precision but little flair, and it goes on for way too long.",
            "Uncommonly sharp writing, a twisty puzzle and a darkly wry sense of humor elevate \"Jack Reacher\" well above the level most big-screen police procedurals attain.",
            "a highly enjoyable throwback to gritty '70s crime thrillers that were made without wires, CGI, or hyperkinetic editing and instead relied on stunts, narrative twists, and star power",
            "[Jack Reacher] is slick and superbly shot.",
            "This hard-charging action flick, based on the bestselling series of novels by Lee Child, is a throwback to the tough-nosed crime dramas of the 1960s and 1970s.",
            "It's so forgettable that its rewatchability factor could be off the charts.",
            "Plain, cleanly directed meat-and-potatoes action filmmaking that aspires to competence and simplicity. A nice change of pace.",
            "Usually McQuarrie keeps things light, letting us enjoy the fantasy of one man defending himself against five enemies with nothing but his fists.",
            "Christopher McQuarrie's Jack Reacher is that rare blend of hard-hitting action and smooth-talking dialogue that makes for an entertaining film.",
            "Cruise does his best to keep a straight face and make himself halfway believable as a brainy roughhouser - think of a less intense Jason Bourne - but ridiculous plotting undermines his efforts.",
            "McQuarrie deftly intermixes observations on human nature - aware that in life, as in all great mysteries, people are not so easily described as \"killer\" and \"victim.\" Part of why you root for Jack Reacher is his empathy for these foibles and follies.",
            "Jack Reacher revolves around wild impossibilities and baffling motivations, and the conclusion is a whopper that outdoes everything I've discussed above."

            "The film has a mesmerisingly vivid things-just-happen feel to it.",
            "If What Richard Did is sometimes a little too understated for its own good, this is still a classy piece of work which convincingly captures the emotionally complex, morally murky texture of real life.",
            "DP David Grennan and [Lenny] Abrahamson have a fine touch with the volatile ensemble dynamics of kids with high energy, quick tempers and the fragile vulnerability of youth. ",
            "You may be shocked by your own reactions to \"what Richard did,\" but you won't soon forget the movie in which he did them.",
            "Abrahamson's penetrating film asks - and does not answer - whether one viciously criminal moment is an aberration, or whether it reveals the weak, shabby person who was there all along.",
            "It's a tough tale of adolescence and the preciousness of life that hits a whole new level of emotion in the aftermath of its life-altering event.",
            "While [Lenny] Abrahamson's patience in setting the scene and establishing the social dynamics among the characters is admirable, his efforts make the film top-heavy with exposition and rather repetitive carousing sequences.",
            "The young, largely unknown cast are uniformly superb with Jack Reynor outstanding as Richard as he carries him from initial buoyant confidence into crisis and then, the final descent into self-flagellating acceptance.",
            "Up-and-coming actor Jack Reynor delivers an astonishing performance as Richard, evoking both sympathy and contempt from the audience.",
            "In lesser hands, What Richard Did could have been a judgmental mess. Instead, it's a measured human drama set in a Dublin rarely seen on screen.",
            "The director's devastating power resides in his ability to turn the before and after of his lead character's actions into a commanding and compassionate morality tale of cause and effect.",
            "The acting could not be bettered, from the principals on down.",
            "[Lenny] Abrahamson also delivers the emotional goods, particularly in a beautifully acted scene between Richard and his father that is as surprising as it is believable. ",
            "It's simply staged but packs the kind of emotional heft which is rarely seen in such films. ",
            "What Richard Did is undeniably a strong, at times powerful exploration of crime and punishment.",
            "Where Abrahamson is beyond reproach, and, in fact quite masterly, is in the film's forensic dissection of its middle-class milieu.",
            "As smoothly shot as a classy ad, slow-moving and short on spark, What Richard Did compels with its sensitivity and technical diligence, but crawls along in terms of onscreen energy and narrative tension.",
            "[What Richard Did is] the most conventional work [Lenny] Abrahamson has produced so far, yet still markedly different from comparable teen pics. ",
            "Newcomer Jack Reynor gives a startling, star-making performance in the slow-burn Irish drama What Richard Did... Consider this indie his Queens Boulevard, if you will.",
            "Mr. Reynor's portrayal of this man-child is an extraordinary screen performance in which his face registers all the conflicting emotions gripping Richard. We see every layer of him, from the scared inner child to the suave, entitled ladies' man.",
            "Isn't shocking in obvious ways, preferring to stun the audience with an authentic atmosphere of guilt and indecision, investing in the frustration of delayed response over unapologetic manipulation.",
            "[Feels] like a Bergman homage without earning the clunky label \"Bergmanesque.\"",
            "A satisfyingly knotted moral fable with some very memorable performances, including a fine piece of charismatic brooding from Reynor."

            "It's a film where nothing can happen, but at the same time, everything happens.",
            "Rural and urban, property lines and blood feuds, family histories and petty battles . . . in a film that reframes Brazil as a place where blood is thicker and murkier than water, even in homes that seem so clean and white and safe.",
            "Entrancing but vaguely discomfiting.",
            "Empty, anxious and puzzling: Neighboring Sounds has an intriguing tone of half-seen unhappiness that never pays off either in black humour or the terror of modern existence.",
            "It's a remarkable, understated fable about social strata and urban paranoia, although its stretches of plotlessness may push patience at 124 minutes.",
            "With each scene, Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho adds layers of meaning to his characters and the neighbourhood, many that no doubt can only be properly appreciated by Brazilian audiences.",
            "A hugely impressive debut feature from Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho.",
            "Has echoes of Michael Haneke as it explores the guilty secrets and bitter resentments lurking beneath the calm, respectable surface of a community in affluent Recife.",
            "For those who don't mind that lingering, almost voyeuristic display of human behaviour, this confident and promising debut is a must-see.",
            "Filho's use of space is masterful, as fine as Antonioni or Polanski, with long Steadicam tracks and crisp wide shots giving us a fine-grained rendering of the block's communal and private spaces.",
            "This is a movie to get lost in. Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho - you're on our list.",
            "The film promises a little more than it delivers, and at over two hours there are moments where it drags. But as a statement of intent, 'Neighbouring Sounds' is incredibly bold.",
            "With its inventive sound, masterly lensing and diverse mix of characters, Filho reveals a society haunted by both its past and by the threat of future violence.",
            "Economically packed with social issues of wealth, property and class, and deft cinematic references, this is a movie built for the modern global high-rise condo market.",
            "Similar to the slow-creep style of Dogtooth director Giorgos Lanthimos, the narrative unfolds with escalating tension, the cause of which is heard and felt but not always seen.",
            "Neighbouring Sounds might be considered something of a horror movie for Brazil's urban bourgeoisie. One of Filho's most audacious tactics is to package what might've otherwise been an Altmanesque ensemble drama as a sort of existential thriller."

            "Every frame pulses with hard-gained experience: it may be the most lived-in film of 2012, and certainly counts among the most moving.",
            "Monitoring the peaks and troughs of this fractious relationship is more fascinating than enjoyable.",
            "This is a painful drama, but its pain is more studied than emotive, and it demands that we think just as much as it makes us feel.",
            "A complex and mysterious tale of a love affair, one that lacks the tidy story arc of a movie but feels real.",
            "When you summon memories of this film, they are almost always of two men in a room, in a default state of discontent.",
            "A heart-breaking love story and call for emotional transparency in relationships.",
            "Keep the Lights On stands as a heart-wrenching arch, oozing with amiable authenticity in slices of life too often shied away from on screen.",
            "Writer/director Ira Sachs has wisely chosen to tell the nine-year affair from the point of view of the filmmaker...",
            "This gay domestic drama is a fascinating turn for Sachs.",
            "Multifaceted director Ira Sachs returns with Keep the Lights On, his first feature since 2007, and is arguably his most poignant and strongest work yet.",
            "Keep The Lights On is still well-made with a terrific cast supporting one of the year's best performances.",
            "The movie's elaborately failed closure only makes sense once you understand that the filmmaker's all-too-human desire for self-justification apparently trumped the ruthless self-control required to make a work of art.",
            "A mournful examination of the extremes of life condensed from a ten-year period into a hauntingly swift 101 minutes of heartbreak.",
            "Keep the Lights On acknowledges (without belaboring) the performative nature of identity; how each of our claims to selfhood, be it sexual, romantic, or professional, are staged on a shifting terrain of habit, fantasy, and desire.",
            "The best film of 2012...Perfect.",
            "Small in frame but large in heart.",
            "Sachs captures Erik's yearning for Paul and Paul's addiction-induced indifference with equal force. ",
            "An intimate, honest and uncompromising study of the need for love and the addictions to drugs, sex and intense emotion that may accompany -- and sabotage -- love's pursuit.",
            "A brutally honest, at times embarrassingly raw, attempt to capture a modern day, urban relationship...bittersweet and filled with memorable details, a huge leap forward for [director] Sachs.",
            "It feels as if we're being given glimpses into real lives unfolding.",
            "There's a lot to like here, and if you're a traditionalist who hungers for a happy ending, you'll find it embedded in the opening credits.",
            "Director-cowriter Sachs takes an unusually intimate look at a 10-year relationship in this beautifully shot and performed New York drama. ",
            "A tenderly observed portrait of a man aching for romance even as he resists the idea of full commitment."

            "Juan of The Dead is rough and ready, the effects are a little shoddy, the comedy is broad and sometimes homophobic but there are just enough whimsical moments and deadpan hilarity to make it worthwhile.",
            "It's probably best enjoyed while drunk.",
            "[C]learly wants to invoke motifs of revolution rocking the status quo and of how people cope under the most extreme expressions of communist... but the humor falls flat -- waaaay flat -- for anyone not Cuban, or not at least familiar with life in Cuba...",
            "It's good day-glo fun with a satirical edge whose playfulness never allows proceedings to get too earnest.",
            "If it's not too late in the day for yet another zombie movie, this has enough small pleasures - especially in the lead characterisations - to make it a worthwhile watch for a) Cuban exiles and b) long-term zombie completists."

            "And justice for all? Hardly.",
            "It tells the story of a terrible crime compounded by a grave injustice that's been remedied, but only in part, so it's impossible to have a single or simple response to the movie.",
            " I found myself leaving the theater in a stunned silence and amazingly disappointed in a justice system that seemed far more invested in protecting itself. ",
            "West of Memphis could have made a statement about presumptions and the fallibility of our justice system. Instead, we see millionaires like Vedder feeling good about themselves for saving three innocent people.",

            "It's another case where, instead of a prosecution having to prove a case, a defendant has to choose the lesser of two evils. \"This happens all the time,\" defendant Damien Echols says of the whole process, and he's right.",
            "A sobering look at how the wheels of justice can be -- and are -- manipulated by political expediency and a small town's tendrils of the old boy network",

            "No one has ever inverted the European horror film with such wit, eloquence and purpose to challenge its audience. If you love this subgenre, you'll feel like BERBERIAN was made exclusively for you. I certainly know I did.",

            "Ultimately, Berberian Sound Studio is just an exercise in meta -- a movie more about generating sensations than making sense -- but it's provocative and effective in the way it shows how a movie doesn't have to be \"real\" to be disturbing."

            "It's a broadly forgiving portrait of an impossible, irascible talent, who seems to have treated life much like his instrument.",
            "We are always being told that books and movies have to have \"sympathetic\" lead characters - well, here's a documentary that does very well without one.",
            "An interesting character study interspersed with classic rock, jazz and Afrobeat clips. Nothing more, but certainly nothing less.",
            "It's all insanely enjoyable.",
            "It's refreshing to watch a music doc, especially one with such intimate access to its subject, in which barely anyone is unreservedly polite about the person in question.",
            "A deceptively unconventional rock 'n' roll tale of drink, drugs, drums and ponies, Bulger's Beware of Mr. Baker saddens as much as it elates. ",
            "As jaw-dropping as Ginger Baker's drumming is, the man himself is even more rattling.",
            "The kind of august rogue who threatens to put his director in hospital and punches him in the face with a cane-and makes him like it.",
            "...essential viewing for classic rock fans and anyone who loves a good rogue of questionable moral character, undeniable talent and a road case full of excellent stories.",
            "What makes this an excellent music doc is the sadness that comes through the madness.",
            "A cracking story, buzzily edited, this warts-and-warts portrait delivers an illuminating insight into recent rock history. Don't miss it.",
            "An entertaining doc on the volatile but great jazz and rock drummer, the controversial London born Ginger Baker.",
            "The constantly gripping film is adroitly assembled.",
            "With no preconceptions, I found this to be one of the films of the year - an extraordinary story about an even more astonishing talent.",
            "Entertaining documentary about the notoriously cantankerous drummer...",
            "Searingly honest and ultimately deeply moving, this is a fascinating portrait of notoriously antisocial former Cream drummer Ginger Baker, now 73 and still raging.",
            "A juicy slice of rock history.",
            "A fascinating rockumentary that pays tribute to its subject's impressive musical odyssey, while illustrating the enormous emotional costs he's incurred along the way.",
            "By turns sad and darkly comedic, but never less than mesmerizing -- a moving and morally conflicted portrait of a true questing spirit.",
            "Ginger Baker has been revealed as a major talent, an innovator and an unlikely survivor. And a not very nice guy.",
            "Ginger Baker is, and was, a train wreck. Yet this film, like Baker's onstage playing, is always riveting, and something you can't look away from.",
            "This straightforward yet insightful documentary pays tribute to its subject without resorting to hagiography.",
            "I watched Beware of Mr. Baker and longed for the time when rock was good, musicians were gods, and good god, the parties and the playing were species of their own."

            "It's among the most understated anti-war films ever made, effortlessly humanistic but far too subtle to indulge in preaching.",
            "A model of simplicity and grace, with emotional effects that move you when you least expect it, the kind of great film that only a master can pull off.",
            "Funny, heart-wrenching, nail-biting, caustic and profound, touting the futility of armed combat while turning imprisonment and escape into a microcosm for society's aspirations and contradictions.",
            "The great illusion is that these men of the officer class are somehow different from the masses who suffered the bloodiest of wars. Renoir proves that they are not.",
            "Unstructured, amateurish nonsense coalesces into meaning and beauty. The variety show's foolishness doesn't just stand in for the civilization the war leaves behind-it becomes its living proof.",
            "...highlights the absurdity of war, or possibly the absurdity of civilized behavior when war is going on just outside.",
            "Renoir, who invokes so skillfully these terrifying images of disintegration, offers in contrast only the old ideal of man's brotherhood, and his film does not tell us whether it is illusion or reality.",
            "Back in 1952, both Orson Welles and David Lean cited the movie as one of their 10 all-time favorite films. Still, not everyone was a fan: Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's rat-faced Minister of Propaganda, declared it \"Cinematic Public Enemy No. 1.\"",
            "often contrasted to All Quiet on the Western Front which has a similar message but told with a very different perspective",
            " Like Universal's Oscar winner 'All Quiet on the Western Front' (1930), 'La Grande Illusion' was banned in Germany by Nazi propaganda minister Josef Goebbels. See it and sing 'La Marseillaise.'",
            "See it and you may begin to appreciate the sorts of standards for greatness that the cinema is capable of setting.",
            "a monumental humanist work",
            "Its very simplicity of utterance gives it a purity that makes other films that try to express similar sentiments feel forced and obvious.",
            "Renoir's 1937 anti-war masterpiece created a new genre, the POW movie, and with his 1939 La R\u00e8gle du jeu constitutes a diptych of unparalleled excellence.",
            "A timeless classic of acting and filmmaking genius that uses the artificiality of war to explore the very construct of society, and is a classic must-see.",
            "A vividly humanist, anti-war classic.",
            "A sorrowful, acutely thoughtful, and wholly imperishable masterpiece...",
            "Tragic. Moving. Funny. A pure joy.",
            "The film makes its moral point about the futility of combat by emphasising the interconnectedness of all humanity via such shared experiences as hunger, desire and friendship. It's also a ripping yarn with a vein of charming and sometimes risqu\u00e9 humour.",

            "The dominance of the madcap side of the film's split personality lays an airy veneer over Dolly and Joseph's woes, making them seem inconsequential - as unsubstantial as an observation about wedding-day weather.",
            "It's as politely dull as the generically benign phrase of its title.",
            "The movie builds with a tragic eloquence that's haunting while at the same time delivering a justifiably tear-filled coda that had me smiling in hopeful exuberance.",
            "The film may help Downton Abbey fanatics looking to kill a little time in that era but holds little cinematic appeal for the rest of us.",
            "..this costume drama set in the lull between World Wars is drawn from Julia Strachey's 1932 novella (apparently much-loved by Virginia Woolf) and proves to be almost impossibly English.",
            "With the critical narrative information delayed until the film's final moments, it's a waiting game for the audience, not unpleasurably spent watching the gorgeous costumes and eccentric behaviour of the family and friends of an anxious bride.",
            "If you're seriously white-knuckling for a dose of English Period Countryside Romanticism while waiting for Downton's next season to roll, Cheerful Weather for the Wedding will be like methadone: it's not going to satisfy you, but it may relieve your itch.",
            "Period drama has simmering conflict, lacks resolution.",

            "A languid film that fizzles from the start.",
            "A very mannered but deadly dull period piece drama of partially upended, stuffy social customs, and a ruinous vehicle for the incandescence of Felicity Jones.",
            "Something happened, you see, and someone or other felt something about it. Why that should matter, why we should care, is lost in a string of bons mots, sidelong glances and frocks.",
            "The Donald Rice film suffers most from an excessively blunt approach.",
            "Strictly recommended for the besotted Anglophile set who revel in watching endless versions of the privileged set enjoying their privileges.",
            "Entertains intermittently with its stiff-upper-lip community interplay, only truly taking command when it focuses on unspoken desires and stymied confessions.",
            "Without a source as rich as Jane Austen to draw on, Cheerful Weather feels incomplete, caroming off previous stories without forging its own way.",
            "A welcome addition to the wedding comedy sub genre, light on its feet and brimming with vivid character portraits.",
            "The costumes are gorgeous, and the settings are plush, but the acting is merely serviceable, and the film lacks either the wit or the energy of its predecessors."

            "Like any good documentary, \"\"The Artist Is Present\" gives insight into the life and work of a truly talented lady. Her works may not be for all tastes she but obviously has an audience if MoMA is any indication.",
            "...for the 2 1/2 month run of the [MoMA] show, Marina would sit completely still in a chair as visitors cued up to sit across from her and look into her eyes. The effect is incredibly and unexpectedly moving.",

            "Requires multiple viewings to pick this one apart.",
            "The reality it takes place in is heightened just enough to make the concept feel ironic, but then all attempt at genuine sentiment subsequently falls flat.",
            "An hour and a half of darkening absurdism.",
            "The film takes some deciphering, but once a viewer cracks its code \"Alps\" opens up into something expansive and rich.",
            "As predictably intolerable as one might've anticipated...",
            "The acting is excellent throughout, each performer managing to play up the comic aspects with a new definition of deadpan. ",
            "This remarkably enjoyable film undoubtedly demands a second viewing -- and most importantly, proves that Lanthimos isn't just a one-hit wonder.",
            "Lanthimos's film Dogtooth disturbed and impressed a lot of people, and I doubt his new film ALPS will receive a different reaction.",
            "Giorgos Lanthimos&#65279;' \"Alps\" is a gimmick brought to life, a conceptual idea of a social situation filmed with automatons and containing but an illustration of a concept.",
            "It will certainly keep you interested, but the ending lacks the strength to make it work completely. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "In fact, you probably shouldn't be reading this review if you have an interest in seeing the film.",
            "Emphatically weird, watchable and niche.",
            "It's hard to see what, if anything, Lanthimos is saying about modern Greece. And without that clear focus, the film feels a bit off-piste.",
            "What does it mean?",
            "From the Greek filmmakers behind the acclaimed anti-thriller Dogtooth, this fiendishly inventive drama is just as complex and telling.",
            "Lanthimos delivers another heady dose of weirdness. Loopier than a frog sandwich but rather wonderful.",
            "Absurdly amusing (in places), rigorously directed, and more interesting on an intellectual level than an emotional one.",
            "Helps make the case that Lanthimos might be a worthy, more entomological successor to Luis Bu\u00f1uel.",
            "The movie contains some of the same elements that made [Dogtooth] so startling but they tend to float around rather than coalesce into a singular perspective.",
            "Lanthimos' vision still compels and challenges, but Alps offers a big idea in place of a better movie.",
            "A film peculiar beyond all understanding, based on a premise that begs belief.",
            "...registers less as a drama than as a filmed scientific experiment."

            "David France's rousing and inspirational documentary should be required viewing for political activists everywhere.",
            "There are personal glimpses into the home lives of activists that left many in my theater wiping their tears on their coat sleeve.",
            "This inspirational, unexpectedly hilarious film is a patchwork of archival footage that takes us up to the present day.",
            "This documentary by David France persuasively argues that one of the greatest grassroots activist campaigns of modern times was the Act Up movement ...",
            "David France's documentary about the 1980s/90s American gay community and its leading role in discovering \"combination therapy\" - the anti-HIV magic bullet - will be inspiring among audiences from the G20.",
            "This raw and passionate AIDS treatment doc suffers from a simple lack of focus.",
            "For anybody who doubts that individuals can combat giant governmental and corporate forces and win, this is a great how-to manual.",
            "An excellent film for both those unfamiliar and gay youth uninitiated with the dark days of the AIDS crisis, and the deadly struggle to speak up or die quietly.",
            "Feels like a far more shallow experience than it really should be.",
            "How to Survive a Plague will leave people feeling hopeful that it can be done sooner rather than later. ",
            "One of the most moving scenes in the film is close to the end when we see the survivors in a series of long, silent close-ups, as they are now... jowls, grey hair and aging itself becomes a triumph, as it rarely is on American movie screens. ",
            "How to Survive a Plague supplies plenty of moments that are electrifying, inspiring and often both, courtesy of such luminary leaders as Peter Staley and Larry Kramer",
            "Like the very best documentaries about political movements, How to Survive a Plague makes you feel humble and, at the same time, extraordinarily proud.",
            "Moving docu follows AIDS scourge and history of gay activism ",
            "It all adds up to not just a document of the time but a blueprint for today's activists.",
            "A compellingly watchable portrait of a battle fought under that most memorable rallying cry: \"Silence = Death\". Bravo.",
            "I don't doubt that anyone who has had a brush with AIDS, lost a friend or even a hero like Queen's Freddie Mercury, will find what is already a socially curious, medically fascinating and politically charged film an unmissably emotional experience.",
            "Nominated for the Oscar, this documentary is one of the most involving and moving films you'll see all year. At its core this is a movie about how a decent society should behave, even to the point of helping people who hurt themselves.",
            "Well-made and featuring an astonishing amount of on-the-scene archive footage, this is a powerfully emotional and hugely inspirational documentary that demands to be seen.",
            "It's no whitewash: important activists from the era admit how much time was lost through internecine squabbling, as well as the struggles they faced against the pitiless anti-gay rhetoric of their political opponents.",
            "It can't be long before we see the Hollywood version.",
            "A moving treatment of a deeply personal subject (France's own partner died of an AIDS-related illness in 1992), and an enthralling depiction of a seriously fired-up popular movement.",
            "An important, moving doc about how LGBT activism taught a community to shun silence.",
            "David France has made an absorbing film to document that moment of immense implosion, called How to Survive a Plague."

            "There's a marked flatness to the film, a real heaviness. Jokes sink, energy is low.",

            "The gags are all over the map after that, a hodgepodge of humor that can't decide whether it wants to be mean-spirited satire or play it safe for a mass audience. The result is Cohen's weakest film to date. ",
            "Assuming you're not easily offended, The Dictator is laugh-out-loud comedy at its best.",
            "It might seem that here, Baron Cohen is doing nothing but poking fun at a couple of dead dictators. But their spirit is alive and well across the Middle East. And his satire can hit home.",

            "Somehow the movie, while still making sure to offend any given demographic, rights itself by becoming of all things, a romantic comedy cum political satire.",
            "The most offensive thing about this film is that it completely lacks a sense of humour. ",
            "The problem is that, unlike Ali G, Borat, and Br\u00fcno, Aladeen is less a force of nature than a scripted performance.",

            "The several allusions to Thomas Mann's forbidden-love novel \"Death in Venice\" are apt, but \"Yossi\" is also a standalone film and an extraordinary sequel.",

            "Predictable if measured uplift aside, Fox keeps \"Yossi\" effortlessly affecting, graced with deadpan humor and a knowingness about lonely lives.",
            "Directed by Eytan Fox, the gifted helmer of the international hit Walk on Water, 'Yossi,' a work of special depth, is yet another of his incisive character studies of a man who doesn't quite fit in until he finally does.",

            "Reygadas' jagged, broken-logic drama lurches from fantasy to earthbound complications, though it is often hard to tell one from the other.",

            "Moviegoers beholden to clean narrative may feel they need their own explanatory GPS and audio guide. But the richer reward lies in allowing oneself to be led by this gifted director's instinct for lyrical, sensory exploration.",
            "This one delivers a grand pictorialism and piercing existential moments that float atop the maundering narrative like noodles in soup.",
            "It's as if Reygadas started with a sprawling cache of visual ideas and then tried to find some way to organize them all. The effect can be frustrating at times, but also surprising and beguiling.",
            "Post Tenebras Lux weaves an austere narrative around the crumbling of family life in rural Mexico while dropping in autobiographical clues of Reygadas' own upbringing in often breathtakingly beautiful moments of serene cinema.",
            "I still can't deny that parts of the film resonated with me, and down the road I might come to appreciate it more, but right now I feel mostly indifferent to what I saw.",
            "If only the movie were as terrific as its 10-minute pre-title sequence.",
            "As the film advances and the narrative clues dry up like an arid desert of unfinished letters, it's tough not to see Reygadas' new work as little more than a series of vignettes, each one bellowing, \"Respect me.\"",
            "When the images are spectacular, a lot can be forgiven; but mostly Post Tenebras Lux is like being trapped in Mr. Reygadas's dream diary.",
            "If Reygadas set out to make an intuitive, pre-cognitive film, then this mysterious, intangible but profoundly resonant prologue comes closest to realizing that dream.",
            "It's either a sublime work of genius or a drearily pretentious nightmare. Possibly both.",
            "The film is at once brilliant and banal, original and derivative, heartfelt and pretentious. Its sheer visual gorgeousness is enthralling, yet there are passages that seem arty and self-indulgent.",
            "As irritating as this film is, I am grateful for it. Reygadas is an artist, and an uncompromising one at that.",
            "An unusually bold and bizarre drama that offers a different way of looking at film.",

            "A completely essential piece of film art.",

            "Even with its head games and confusions, \"Post Tenebras Lux\" is an imposing spiritual work,",

            "A satisfying, enormously likable genre cocktail, Cockneys vs. Zombies not only delivers upon its title promise, but does so with wit and fleet-of-foot aplomb.",
            "Cockneys vs. Zombies quickly overcomes its dull-as-death titling and turns out to be the best zombie yuk-fest since Edgar Wright broke new, unhallowed ground with Shaun of the Dead nearly a decade ago.",

            "An entertaining romp with nitwits and monsters, keeping to the essentials of makeshift warfare while preserving all the necessary funny business. All that's missing from the effort is a translator for American audiences. ",

            "If you are in a fight, you want this man on your side. He is charismatic, brave and most of all entirely believes in what he is what he is doing. I'm not sure he know the meaning of the word compromise.",
            "Climate-change documentaries are almost always disturbing, but \"The Island President\" communicates a special urgency.",
            "Nasheed is indeed inspirational, a cool-headed but passionate and courageous guy. You end up wishing a lot more leaders were like this guy.",
            "Shenk expertly weaves Nasheed's extraordinary personal story together with the Maldives' breathtaking natural beauty and a Capra-esque tale of dogged idealism and political courage to create wonderfully vivid cinematic portraiture.",
            "What makes Nasheed's whirligig tactics so urgent is that, unlike most other countries participating in the summit, his own nation is actually in danger of being annihilated by climate change.",
            "Pairing these striking visuals with a fitting soundtrack...The Island President makes for a polished piece of documentary work that paints its subject as a stifled martyr.",
            "A smart and engaging portrait of a man for whom this issue hits closer to home than anyone, illustrating a tremendous issue that is now too big, and no longer able, to be ignored.",
            "The Hilton LightStay Sustainability Award, part of a programme in association with the Sundance Institute, is given to films that heighten sustainability awareness. And they could not have picked a better candidate than The Island President.",
            "Yet the documentary is at its most engrossing when it moves away from the big picture and focuses not on Mother Nature [but] a few of the people she affects -- especially the title character.",
            "One only hopes that the documentary will help advance Nasheed's mission and inspire others to join arms out of shared ecological concern.",
            "A fascinating look at an extraordinary personality.",
            "The haunting \"How to Disappear Completely\" plays over the closing credits. If Nasheed isn't able to wake up the world to his country's plight, in a few decades, that could be the new Maldives national anthem. ",
            "As an insight into the cynical nature of world politics, The Island President is wonky but fascinating stuff ... But as a testament to mankind's willingness to change... it's deeply dispiriting. ",
            "The film clearly sides with Nasheed's David as he battles Goliath-like businesses and governments, but it never loses sight of the fact that his efforts to preserve the fragile beauty of the sinking Maldives may already be doomed.",
            "Shenk's tight storytelling makes for a gripping film that delivers the ugly, at times ennobling, truth.",
            "A socially engaged documentary with more heart than head, this slice of boosterism focusing on the exiled Maldives president achieves unexpected ancillary connection as a ground-floor look at a grand clash of political and governmental wills.",
            "An absorbing portrait of a man trying to turn a tide of indifference.",
            "\"The Island President\"is heartening and unsettling by turns.",
            "Primary meets environmental documentary. A must-see now that political strife has forced the film's subject, President Mohamed Nasheed, to resign.",
            "Nasheed is a fascinating man with grand ideas that stand in direct contrast to his appearance.",
            "Shenk gets almost unfettered acccess to Nasheed, who is refreshingly honest about the tactics he is employing to get other countries onside ",
            "It's a gut punch to every single person who has come to the wholly depressing conclusion that the world our grandparents enjoyed may not exist for our children. ",

            "With excerpts of early clips of his first roles, to current interviews with him, the movie details a life of tremendous creativity and courage.",
            "This is a fabulous documentary about a man and the times that were, and hopefully still are, a-changin'.",
            "With Belafonte narrating his own story, Sing Your Song increasingly feels more like a personal memoir than objective insight.",

            "The star is still Trump. Why this gigantic turd with legs remains the object of fascination to so many speaks unfortunate volumes about the plummeting IQ of the mass audience.",
            "As Baxter demonstrates with agonizing, unflinching clarity, the result was a community and a land that were literally rolled over in the name corporate greed - and with the apparent blessing of the local authorities.",
            "Baxter is a little too staid, too polite to get outrageous - and that keeps the film from outraging us the way it should.",
            "Baxter may not be the most accomplished filmmaker, but he's on the side of the angels here and his determination to give the locals a voice denied them by major media coverage lends his film momentum and heart.",
            "First-time director Anthony Baxter jettisons all pretense of impartiality, without adding any of the intelligent outrage of his evident influence, Michael Moore.",
            "A fine, powerful piece of documentary filmmaking, using old-fashioned v\u00e9rit\u00e9 techniques -- and more than a little audience manipulation -- to show how political influence and media savvy help the wealthy exert their will.",
            "Mr. Trump comes across as an insensitive, lying bully who will do whatever it takes to realize his dream of creating what he promises will be the world's greatest golf resort.",
            "Secure in its righteous rage, You've Been Trumped never stops for a second to seriously explore the economic points of view, even ones that might benefit the community.",
            "Donald Trump is the face of America here, representing all of us and demonstrating our values abroad. Hopefully this sharp rendering, or something very much like it, is the legacy for which he and his family will be remembered.",
            "Though Anthony Baxter seems driven by empathy rather than greed, his film is ultimately as reductive and misleading as the expensive Trump PR campaigns he righteously rails against. ",
            "Supremely entertaining documentary about the salt of the earth versus Satan.",
            "It could also be a terrific feature, a John Sayles movie maybe, although it's possible no one would believe a character as odious as the villain of this piece.",
            "Gives a vital airing to a virtually unheard side of a truly sickening story, but it's also thoroughly depressing to watch and you can't help wishing Baxter had tried harder to confront the people responsible."

            "More food porn...Though the celebrity status accorded chefs has gone way out of control, this is actually not a bad little documentary.",
            "An intimate, immaculate doco that ends up a stirring but unsentimental meditation on tradition and family. ",
            "The film attempts to tell the story of father Michel handing over his restaurant business to son S\u00e9bastien, but it makes a botch of it",
            "Paul Lacoste's documentary about the gastronomic lifestyle of the Bras family... explores the men beyond their reputations in the world of fine cuisine, where Michelin Stars are priceless diamonds on a dark and starless night",
            "Culinary idolatry where the camera takes up residence in the kitchen of a world-renowned chef to gaze in awe.",
            "There are some interesting father/son dynamic moments in the film that give it some merit. But I thought JIRO DREAMS OF SUSHI, which was released earlier this year, was much more focused and pretty much the same story.",
            "A documentary about a painstaking and intellectual chef, known for his elegant food, who is passing his restaurant to the next generation, even though it's clear he's not psychologically ready to do it.",
            "Mildly engaging, but leaves you hungry for more emotional and intellectual depth. ",
            "Sprinkle lime peelings onto milk-white ingredients: a verdant feast for the eye.",
            "Lacoste cleverly uses the enhanced sound of Michel slowly, deliberately chewing and crunching, in what is really the film's climax.",
            "The food preparation and the interactions in the immaculate, gorgeous restaurant are so engrossing that sidebars about things like leisure time in the countryside feel extraneous.",
            "\"Step Up to the Plate\" asserts how family, in multifarious ways, can be the most deeply affecting of ensembles.",
            "While foodies are sure to feel sated by the gastronomic splendors of Paul Lacoste's debut documentary, others may walk out with a strange sense of emptiness.",

            "Step Up to the Plate doesn't skimp on the food-porn goods, but the dynamic between its two stoical subjects is too undercooked to truly resonate.",
            "Paul Lacoste's almost purely observational approach allows him to come about as close to documenting the process of creation as anyone ever has.",
            "When it loses sight of this change of hands story, the film loses its direction, making me want it either back on track or over.",
            "...director Paul Lacoste (\"Inventing Cuisine: Michel Bras\"), making his feature debut here, is ofttimes more enamored with symbolic imagery than informational clarity."

            "Mira Sorvino is very good -- too good -- at playing a very annoying person in Nancy Savoca's Union Square.",
            "Propelled by a rangy, superbly colorful performance by Mira Sorvino, the film grabs hold of the viewer from the jump and snowballs toward a deftly moving and concise third act.",
            "It doesn't pretend to be anything more than it is - a slice-o'-life domestic drama/dark comedy of manners savvy about its limits and sufficiently disciplined to keep its convolutions to a credible, impactful minimum.",
            "Sorvino brings a spark, but neither she nor Patti LuPone, in an amusing cameo, can overcome the clockwork-like plod to the end.",
            "At a running time of 80 minutes, Union Square runs into some threadbare patches, but nothing that isn't quickly dissipated by a passionately endearing performance from Sorvino.",
            "\"Union Square\" isn't nearly as overwhelming as a whole, but it's a fun enough diversion, emphasis on that last part for this story where everyone's got something to hide.",
            "A half-sketched tale of familial floundering, Union Square is a suffocating and pantomimed drama that makes an especially unconvincing and headlong dive into sentimentality in its finale.",
            "Long stretches of \"Union Square\" are kind of irksome to watch, as you just have to wait for all the bickering and chatter to calm down in order for the true drama to begin. But once we get to the emotional boxing, we see how hurt these women really are.",
            "Lucy's general unpleasantness is a hurdle the film can't clear.",
            "The film is undone by the fact that both protagonists are obnoxious caricatures.",
            "Just when it seems to be going [for] an amusing family Thanksgiving comedy, it zings sharply (and awkwardly) into exposing raw emotions from painful wounds sisters share.",
            "A solid performance piece for two actresses that don't often get meaty material to tear into.",
            "An interesting study of families, of class-consciousness, of little passive-aggressive tricks.",
            "\"Union Square\" has the busy, hemmed-in talkiness of a theater piece, with too much forced to happen in too short a time. But it also has a lively, nervous energy and an expansive sympathy for the mismatched women at its heart.",
            "Savoca's ear for dialogue and a pair of electric lead performances give this souped-up one-act some life.",
            "Often funny and emotionally observant study of contrasting sisters has good performances, especially by Tammy Blanchard and, in a tiny but telling role, the transcendent Patti LuPone.",
            "Despite its problems, there's a touching sweetness at the heart of Nancy Savoca's intimate family drama about estranged sisters trying to reconnect.",
            "The look is minimalist but the two lead actresses add pleasing layers to characters of estranged sisters who parted ways for reasons Lucy refers to only cryptically.",
            "Character-driven drama about two estranged sisters who reach a point where they must choose either reconciliation or permanent separation from each other.",
            "With its small cast and focus on performance, Union Square promises to be a welcome showcase for Sorvino, and the early rhymes with Miss Linda are intriguingly open-ended.",
            "The actors are so good ... that they make you want to see what they could do in a better movie than this tedious acting-class experiment.",
            "This is a film that bores into you, mostly because of Sorvino's performance, which starts out at a level of white heat and never cools below incendiary."

            "Clayman, who co-directed with filmmaker friends, is fascinating company. The camera allows a necessary distance for him, as evidenced by the ladies who sit with him at a speed-dating session. They don't get him, but he's not the one missing out.",
            "Insightful look into the world of the mentally disturbed-by a filmmaker who is also his own subject.",

            "Rendered with cinematic brio and forceful clarity.",
            "Stands as moving evidence that Clayman's trust in the value of the filmmaking process ultimately outweighed the extreme difficulty he says he has making even the smallest decisions."

            "Despite the occasional stumble, the doc never falls, thanks to the sheer strength of its subjects' undaunted and indomitable character.",
            "The doc gives a rare look at the business of plying the world's oldest profession over the past 50 years in the famously tolerant city, but the directors are a bit too hands-off and the narrative wanders.",
            "Year by year, they've shared every part of their lives, and now the Fokkens sashay into the future, sharing memories and viewpoints as well as their neon-bright identical outfits.",
            "The filmmakers follow the sisters around town, creating a delightful portrait of good-natured extroverts.",
            "The sisters' struggle for autonomy (they opened Amsterdam's only independent brothel until they were forced out by organized crime) reveals a touching commitment to mutual survival.",
            "A prostitute's sexual freedom is a fiction; though this isn't news, the film confronts the issue with rawness and panache.",
            "Despite the pleasure of spending a little over an hour with these two warm, loving women, Meet the Fokkens often falters as a film.",
            "Amusing and even liberating to watch, but lacks sufficient insight and revelations. How often do you get to see a doc about elderly prostitutes?",
            "The feminist documentary takes up the battered-wife syndrome, low pay for female workers, forced separation of mothers and children and-finally-a woman-owned business. Gloria Steinem must be happy, though the film centers on 69-year-old twin hookers.",
            "Few recent studies of commercialized sex have been character profiles, so Rob Schr\u00f6der and Gabrielle Provaas's doc is an unusual and welcome polemic.",
            "To what degree the seductive senior siblings for sale are leveling with audiences is up for grabs, but certain truths vividly come into play. Namely, their refusal to act old, along with challenging the cultural norms of what it means to be beautiful.",
            "A racy, thoroughly enjoyable docu about a pair of 69-year-old identical-twin hookers in Amsterdam, Meet the Fokkens bounces along with defiant joie de vivre.",
            "Schr\u00f6der and Provaas frame their conversation well, making good use of the color, the reflective surfaces, and the surfeit of exposed younger flesh in the District.",
            "\"Meet the Fokkens\" holds your interest, mostly because the sisters (who turned 70 in May) are good company, no matter who they are.",
            "If there's a tug of sadness to this (off-)colorful tale, it has less to do with sympathy for these resilient women than with how easily their compromised lives can be related to our own.",
            "The film is about two old ladies, still cackling despite the sadness that trailed in the wake of the lives into which they were forced."

            "[VIDEO ESSAY] With an emphasis on gory brutality, Corbucci introduced a blood-soaked drifter closely modeled after Clint Eastwood's iconic character from Leone's films, but with one clear difference - Django drags a coffin with him everywhere he goes.",
            "When Tarantino's bulging eyes first laid eyes on Django...one can understand his affection for the film's memorable iconography - the dragged coffin, the hand crushed by a rifle butt; stylisation that made a two dime plot more colourful, more memorable.",
            "Django is a mean, unpretentious genre wallow.",

            "Funny enough to be disarming even when it's spinning its wheels thematically.",

            "There's more than stage talk in Dori Berinstein's documentary: Hiding within it is a remarkable, moving love story.",
            "There's little sense of the Carol Channing beneath the overdone makeup - if there is one - except maybe to celebrate her fourth marriage to a high school classmate who died recently.",
            "Carol Channing is 91 going on 7. That is meant as a compliment.",
            "[Captures] the essence of Carol as one of those creatures of the theater that when you see her onstage, you know you've seen something special.",

            "Let's hope Dolly finds her way back to center stage and never goes away again.",
            "A film, and a life, worth cheering for, that will send audiences out of the theater on a cloud, whistling her iconic tunes, grinning from ear to ear. ",
            "It's no surprise that she never really succeeded on television or film because Carol Channing truly is larger than life.",
            "Still, a documentary of this nature lives and dies by the personality of its subject and Carol Channing has plenty to spare.",
            "As show biz documentaries go, this one is a must-see.",
            "In her ninth decade, Carol Channing is the subject of a documentary about her incredible life and devotion to entertainment that is as delightful and effervescent as the bubbly star herself. ",
            "Carol Channing: Larger than Life is like a warm cinematic hug from Shubert Alley, not to be missed by anyone with even the remotest passing interest in Channing or Broadway history.",
            "This is a love letter to a born star and living legend that will make you laugh, cry, and be thankful that the great Channing is still here among us.",
            "Here's hoping another generation will take a look at a life that's even more impressive for the fact that it continues to be a work in progress.",
            "There's not much beyond all the fawning, but the effusively talented Channing more than deserves the gush.",
            "Dori Berinstein's desultory, fawning profile of the nonagenarian performer devotes many of its padded 88 minutes to Channing's greatest success, playing the title yenta in Hello, Dolly! on Broadway in the 1960s.",
            "Smarten up and pay attention. The Queen of Broadway enters.",
            "The lady was - and remains - a pro, still glowin', crowin', goin' strong.",
            "A terrifically entertaining, smartly constructed trip down memory lane with one of the American stage's most legendary troupers.",
            "Enjoyable, endearing portrait of a true Broadway icon.",
            "A bubbly 90-year-old mascot from the golden days of the American musical, this doc's subject is certainly larger than the conventional testimonial treatment she's given.",
            "The soft touch makes perfect sense, though anyone not already lined up at the altar of old-school Broadway will find the film slower going."

            "There is no glamour in this film; a low-key observational approach, keeps judgement and hard-hitting shock tactics at arms length.",
            "The film will, at the very least, make you wonder about who the \"girl model\" really is the next time you open a fashion magazine or see a billboard.",

            "Candid look at a sometimes-frightening industry.",
            "Explores a world that doesn't just appreciate youth. It lusts for it. ",

            "The radiant sadness of its two subjects-one a soulfully impassive stripling, one a symmetrical husk-forms the center of Girl Model, and that is enough.",
            "An alarming documentary about the trafficking of Russian child models to the Japanese fashion market ...",

            "This is a solid, entertaining conclusion that fans of the series will love and others can endure.",

            "The troubling fact is that the whole shiny edifice of Mary Sue indulgence here is built to cover up one of the most disturbing fantasies that pop culture has concocted in quite some time.",

            "One of the great outpourings of cinematic invention in an age of over-all artistic liberation.",
            "As an allegory it lacks any resonance, as a movie it stinks.",
            "Two zany young teenage girls are the focus of this extremely funny, witty and expertly-fashioned film.",
            "Chytilova overtly says, 'I'm going to use cinema as a weapon against a world that uses these kinds of weapons'.",
            "...wreaks havoc with an explosive playfulness that wouldn't be out of place in a Looney Tunes cartoon.",
            "These women are doing more than just dallying with liberation; they may let themselves be a bit spoiled, but will continue to break down social conventions in the process, and not let any of their feminist energy or dissenting attitudes go to waste.",
            "A riotous explosion of colour, chaos and confusion.",
            "It's a symbolic film comprised of deliberately inconsistent artifice both in its look and sound... an approach that serves a narrative which never seeks coherency.",
            "The Maries, and Daisies itself, are quintessential fruits of the Czech New Wave, deconstructing social hierarchies while embodying the free-flowing, iconoclastic ethos that roused and buoyed 1960s Czechoslovak cinema.",
            "[A] surreal, sexy, socialist pre-Prague Spring daydream: artful anarchy rules with bonus \"mod\" pop-art eyeball-kick fashion.",
            "A surrealist fantasy of the banality and conformity of Czech society.",
            "Daisies starts out like a bad 1960s student art film, but its colorful anarchy grows on you.",
            "Incoherent.",
            "A pretentiously kookie and laboriously overblown mod farce.",
            "Just about the most ticklish barrage of nihilism in cinema",
            "My favorite Czech film, and surely one of the most exhilarating stylistic and psychedelic eruptions of the 60s, this madcap and aggressive feminist farce by Vera Chytilova explodes in any number of directions.",
            "These two slim, mod beauties revel in their infantile defilement before swinging from chandeliers and catwalking down the buffet table.",
            "From elderly apparatchiks to cinematic continuity, nothing is sacred, as the director punctures the illusion of \"civilized\" society and viewer's frontal lobes.",

            "Yes, the pacing of In Our Nature is slow, and drags near the film's halfway point, but the top-notch ensemble propels the film forward, adding complexity to the characters while leaving the over-the-top melodrama for Lifetime.",
            "Like Carnage it gets off to a rocky start in keeping all its protagonists from leaving the movie. But if you can make it past that - and John Slattery helps a bunch - Brian Savelson's film settles into a nicely mature story about airing grievances.",

            "Although there is no narration or manipulative music track, Denis C\u00f4t\u00e9's long-take documentary look at Parc Safari in Hemmingford, Quebec, screams out (quietly) on the side of animal rights.",
            "The film is at turns mundane, poetic, disturbing and comical...invites all kinds of reactions, from our urge to anthromorphize animals to a desire to truly understand them.",
            "Bestiaire isn't for everyone. It demands a patient audience willing to fill in the gaps between C\u00f4t\u00e9's striking compositions and telling montage.",
            "Bestiaire accommodates multiple readings, allowing its audience to project theories about spectatorship and captivity onto its silent beasts of burden.",
            "Bestiaire is, most profoundly, about the dynamics of looking, an exercise in studying gazes that are either unidirectional or, superficially, at least, reciprocated.",
            "Cows stare dumbly ahead; a llama paces back and forth in front of a wire-mesh fence; lions and tigers loudly rattle their cages.",
            "Bestiaire argues persuasively without words, making a case without explicating one at all.",
            "These beasts live a compromised life and Bestiaire raises questions as to whether mankind's best intentions justify the sacrifices they have unwittingly made.",
            "This is a challenging and rewarding piece that reflects your own thoughts as much as those of the filmmaker.",
            "erving up artfully framed, static-camera compositions of the animals within their mismatched environs, Cote's actuality-style catalog of context-free tableaux invites auds to free-associate with the scenes put before them."

            " \"This is 40\" limps along, carried by the charm and charisma of Rudd and Mann, until it reaches a lazy, simple conclusion.",
            "If Apatow makes us squirm while we laugh along, then he's probably hit the nail right on the head, and he hits that mark dead on more often that not. It's one of his finest and most mature works to date.",

            "It's like if Knocked Up was instead titled This is 35, and This is 40 were chapter two. It's just redundant.",
            "Worth seeing but a bit of pruning wouldn't have gone amiss.",
            "It's a little silly, sometimes too pointed, and overly long, but at its heart are perceptive observations about the challenge of long-term relationships, raising a family, and turning 40 -- some of which will ring true for many of us.",
            "This Is 40 is intermittently funny, frequently embarrassing and, at 134 minutes, quite a bit too long.",
            "Apatow's descent as a storyteller is continuing, and his ear for comedy isn't at its peak.",
            "There's a shrillness that is admirable in theory but rather off-putting in practice. It's just not very funny.",

            "This stale and flaccid exercise looks as if it has come from one of those old notebooks in which [Allen] keeps discarded ideas.",

            "It's like being in boring old Heaven when you thought you had won a ticket to exciting, seriocomical Purgatory.",

            "A galumphing dud.",
            "Allen's creative revival comes to a juddering halt with a foursome of would-be amusing vignettes that barely muster a laugh between them.",
            "I'd like to equate this film to a nice vacation getaway: it's fun while it lasts, but sooner or later we need to wake up and get back to reality.",
            "It made me feel like I had a year watching it. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "If I had never seen a Woody Allen film or knew of his work until seeing To Rome With Love, I would have to call him a consummate storyteller who taps into the fabric of human nature.",
            "Allen seems utterly convinced of the film's comic value and novelty by extending what are essentially lame skits to a nauseatingly long running-time.",
            "A walking through Rome. A short tales of a city. The people who runs the city. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Though packaged with tourist clich\u00e9s, Allen's Roman holiday captures the city's amber light and lyrical chaos. ",
            "Each segment cannibalizes the other until all are reduced to broad strokes or snippets of thoughts, ramshackled together, creating a confection that aims to be a Prada cupcake but ends up messy proletariat pudding.",
            "Lacks backbone. It also lacks a scrupulous editor and a decent script. ",
            "It's a solid comedy that, in its one-liner-heavy dialogue, reminds us of classic Woody Allen.",
            "Judy Davis is an absolute treasure to watch and the film is funny but unpolished.",
            "Consumers should be advised that To Rome with Love requires that the moviegoer survive at least four Woody Allens.",
            "Even Allen's most loyal of fans must be starting to wonder why the once great director keeps on producing such dull material.",
            "Woody Allen's new film is relaxed, easy-to-digest, light entertainment-&#65279;&#65279;middle-brow fluff done right.",
            "[Woody] Allen seems to have been refreshed with his sojourn in Europe, and even in something as inconsequential as this has energy and invention.",
            "Is To Rome with Love great Woody Allen? No. It's not even very good Woody Allen. It's probably mediocre Woody Allen, at best. But mediocre Woody Allen is still better than the majority of the movies made today. ",
            "When it works, it works well and when it doesn't, which is too often, it is still amusing but very slight.",
            "Midnight in Paris was profound in a deceptively breezy way. To Rome With Love is just plain breezy, but I didn't mind.",
            "Weightless and harmless and made with good cheer."

            "Every now and again a film comes along that could play as a parody of itself with minimal alteration, and 90 per cent of them seem to have some kind of connection to Adam Sandler.",
            "It's nice that the hero goes to the mat for what he believes in. But he's not the only thing that comes down with a thud.",
            "It delivers exactly what's expected from a flabby mishmash of high school inspirational tale and Mixed Martial Arts fighting exhibitionism ladled out by Adam Sandler running mate Frank Coraci ...",
            "Here Comes the Boom will probably connect like a haymaker with most of its intended audience. The leads are likeable, and the plot, though beyond incredible, is at the very least distracting.",
            "I have no qualms about saying that anyone who appreciates Kevin James will unquestionably appreciate Here Comes the Boom.",
            "The formulaic fight movie is boosted by the built-in energy of UFC events and the rock soundtrack... By the time the last fight starts the audience is totally invested, cringing with every blow and cheering each successful punch.",
            "The way James, Rutten, and Winkler connect is engaging and amusing, and Here Comes the Boom is moderately successful on that chemistry alone. And if something can crack my cold, cold heart, that's a victory.",
            "All in all, it's great family fun.",
            "In this tacky \"Stand And Deliver\" meets \"Rocky\" hybrid, logic isn't even a word, let alone a concern of the filmmakers. ",
            "Ultimately, the film is much too derivative to stand (and deliver) on its own, but at its best moments, it proves amiably average, chiefly due to James' natural charms.",
            "It isn't nearly as funny or inspiring as it wants to be, but it makes a legitimate effort.",
            "A lightweight action-comedy that only tries to entertain, but at least it meets that modest goal. And it knocks out lighter weight comedies like The School of Rock.",
            "The highly likeable Kevin James headlines a highly likeable school/sports comedy lark in which he again plays a lovable oaf.",
            "The 'Mr. Holland's Opus' meets 'Rocky II' story will satisfy some who long for innocuous content, even those who know James deserves better material.",
            "An average made-for-TV-type movie that makes its way onto the big screen, 'Here Comes the Boom' doesn't pack much of a punch.",
            "Now, then. When is Stallone going to start playing a head teacher? Maybe the switch would work the other way...",
            "105 painful minutes of a fat guy getting punched in the face and falling down.",
            "Merely the kind of film that once it's on DVD will end up as necessarily mindless fodder for bench-pressing numbskulls to watch in a gym.",
            "The film aims to be simultaneously a coarse sentimental little-guy comedy, a tale of embracing the American dream, and an increasingly serious underdog fight movie on the lines of Rocky. It fails on all three counts.",
            "Couldn't Kevin have raised the money by selling hard drugs or trafficking underage women? The closing scenes would, under those circumstances, have seemed only marginally less peculiar.",
            "There's nothing here that you haven't seen a dozen times before and done much better.",

            "Like the select participants of its savage sport, The Hunger Games stands triumphant, if scarred and a bit wobbly from the contest.",
            "I know we're supposed to tut-tut about levels of cinematic violence, but this seems to me one of the rare occasions when the film needed to be bolder, and nastier.",

            "It doesn't leave any room for virtuosity and is about as literal and unsurprising a visual realisation of the story as you can get. ",
            "Although the casting of a relative unknown like Jennifer Lawrence in the crucial role of Katniss was a bit controversial, in the hindsight of her Oscar win and status as hottest young thing in Hollywood, the choice seems brilliant. ",
            "THE HUNGER GAMES has made its mark and, despite its issues, is a more interesting and admirable one than the 12A audience has been offered in some time.",
            "It's a bit of a thrill to see a bow-hunting girl nursing and defending her man, a good enough takeaway on its own to recommend The Hunger Games to both kids and the parents who drive them to the movies.",
            "Jennifer Lawrence is engaging as Katniss; indifferent to the circumstances and determined to survive, you end up admiring her spunk and defiance to The Man.",

            "The film is frequently funny, always elegant (or mock-elegant), and something that would make Humbert Humbert laugh all the way to his asylum. ",
            "There are many echoes of Anderson's earlier films, particularly Rushmore and Tenenbaums. He's an unapologetic romantic and Moonrise Kingdom is a study in wish-fulfillment. ",
            "Most of Wes Anderson's previous pictures came from the head; Moonrise Kingdom is one from the heart.",
            "Anderson never loses his core themes - young love, the need to escape, the bind and bluster of family. His \"Kingdom\" may not be large, but it is perfectly appointed.",
            "The performances from Hayward and Gilman, as runaways, are at the heart of the film, and they manage to seem both innocent and powerful.",
            "Phonies may complain that Anderson's island of misfit toys is a retreat from the real world, but for pure-hearted adventurers who share the secret map, \"Moonrise Kingdom\" is a joy that cannot be eclipsed.",
            "A realistic story set in what could, perhaps, be called an unrealistic world. ",
            "Engrossing, genuinely touching, and even a touch adventurous.",
            "It is further proof that Wes Anderson's mind is constantly challenged at the time of generating ingenious ideas. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Moonrise Kingdom is the closest that Wes Anderson has ever gotten to Trufaut. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "In Moonrise Kingdom, Wes Anderson paints a chaotic frame that mirrors the chaos that comes with growing up. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Filled with wonderful performances, Moonrise Kingdom manages to be Wes Anderson's most accessible film while not compromising his style. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Wes Anderson beautifully paints this world with humor and color. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "A delight from beginning to end. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Wes Anderson shows us young love in a simple, brilliant and honest way. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "A delight for Wes Anderson fans. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Moonrise Kingdom has a sensibility that is rarely seen in movies. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Wes Anderson conquers what he has been going for for two films: maintaining fidelity to himself by seizing an expressive territory never seen before. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Brokenness is woven together and given one opportunity to redeem. The opportunity is taken. Redemption is possible. And we are all better for it. Amen, Wes Anderson. Amen.",
            "The grand irony is that in delivering a film that is arguably the best example of his particular archetype, he has put together one which could even be recommended in an attempt to win over Wes Anderson sceptics.",
            "Ultimately, Moonrise Kingdom is about one love affair between Suzy and Sam on the upsurge and another, between the Bishop parents, fizzling out, a parallel construction that gives the film its bittersweet, lovely, unique tone.",
            "Colourful, funny and understatedly lovely, Moonrise Kingdom marks the return to form for Wes Anderson.",
            "This is a beautiful ode to first love with Anderson's trademark style. The writing is sharp and witty and the cinematography and set designs are extraordinary. Moonrise Kingdom looks like a Norman Rockwell painting come to life.",
            "A charming little movie."

            "George's son asks for Wi-Fi, and Madea says, ''Sure, I can make you a waffle.'' That's one of the good jokes.",
            "He's still a young guy, but all throughout Witness Protection I imagined Perry sitting glumly at a dressing-room mirror, like the aging Chaplin in Limelight, forlornly rubbing makeup in his face -- a tired, old clown stuck in a tired, old routine.",
            "The writer-director-star still hasn't learned to smoothly blend broad comedy and family-values sermonizing.",
            "Reviewing a Tyler Perry movie is a bit like reviewing the weather report.",
            "Tyler Perry doesn't have to make sense, or a have a point. He's laughing all the way to the bank.",
            "Pretty much the entire film is played for laughs here.",
            "It's a big mess of a film, but it isn't totally a wash because Madea the character is good enough to milk a few laughs here and there.",
            "The acting talent in this film is minimal. Forced dialogue and frequent lame jokes weigh down this Madea film, making the nearly two-hour feature unbearably long.",
            "Unambitious and evaporates almost as rapidly as it plays out, but at least it knows what it is and only has one aim: to divert viewers for two hours.",
            "The frantic seventh installment in this highly successful comedy franchise is filled with throwaway gags and self-conscious scenes.",
            "His best and most agreeable Madea comedy.",
            "Much of the film doesn't even play as Tyler Perry, but as yet another example in the evergreen \"Eugene Levy slumming it for a paycheck\" subgenre.",
            "There are laughs in it, according to the enthusiastic audience I saw it with, but they're pretty spaced out and belong to Madea. What happens between them is unremarkable.",
            "A big step backwards for a star who has better things to do. ",
            "As long as the movie focuses on Madea it is funny, and fun for the audience, but when the camera is off her the movie drags.",
            "In short, a real drag.",
            "Perry's writing shows a disturbing amount of cynicism, if not downright meanness, for a family movie.",
            "The mighty Madea preaches, but with less fire this time.",
            "The film remains buoyed by the same open heart that makes Tyler Perry's best work so endearing.",
            "Perry sustains an infusion of tangy wit, as he mines the cultural and economic but primarily racial disconnects and divides of this nation. With a charmingly sweet and sour, more buoyant than boisterous Perry this time around, playfully at the helm.",
            "Madea goes mainstream!",
            "The interaction among opposites inspires an abundance of predictable race-based jokes, many of which have the saving grace of actually being funny."
