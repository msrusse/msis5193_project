            "The film's intensity mirrors the competitive and wild personalities of the pilots themselves. In this arena, the casting is on-target.",
            "... \"Top Gun\" is terribly monotonous.",
            "The movie, in short, hits its emotional marks, but it does so with such insistence that it feels less like real life than an object lesson in the architecture of the blockbuster.",
            "There are elements that hold up - especially Cruise's blinding charisma. The aerial scenes are still thrilling, and perfectly suited to a giant screen. Everything else? Well, that depends on how nostalgic you're feeling.",
            "The aerial sequences in Top Gun are as thrilling -- while remaining coherent -- as any ever put on film.",
            "Whether you love Top Gun or hate it -- or hate yourself for loving it -- the fact is that when it became the top-grossing film of 1986, Hollywood in its infinite wisdom took all of the worst lessons from its success and overlooked what made it so... fun.",
            "Tony Scott brought some incredible shots to the film, mounting cameras everywhere on the fighter jets to achieve amazing footage while giving the audience the feeling they were flying right alongside Maverick.",
            "Could Top Gun actually be a portrait of the dark side of American individualism?",
            "Slickly made, it's a fairly entertaining watch that doesn't provide much beyond surface thrills, although many have had fun analyzing its (unintentional?) homoerotic content.",
            "\"Top Gun\" works best as a sort of time capsule, a window into a pretty spectacular decade for big-budget filmmaking.",
            "Cruise, the cheesy soundtrack and the stunning aerial photography that marks out its combat scenes are its three main selling points.",
            "You can argue that it's a cool movie, but is \"Top Gun\" a good movie? I'd definitely say \"Hell no,\" topped with \"Are you kidding me?\"",
            "The unashamedly goofy 1986 dogfighting classic flips on the afterburners to make yet another pass on Blu-ray, this time soaring into the third dimension. ",
            "It's still the same old Top Gun, retaining every frame of ridiculousness and emphatic acting that turned the Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer production into a legend. ",
            "The 3D is impressive considering it wasn't shot for that, and the sound delivers full throttle engine roars and the legendary soundtrack sounds as crisp as ever. ",
            "If you missed it in theaters the first time, it's probably going to be the best movie theater experience you'll have so far this year.",
            "An undeniably cheesy yet strangely appealing time capsule, with a little something for everyone provided we understand that it's all bubblegum. ",
            "Watching Top Gun again twenty five years after its release is still a dazzling and dizzying experience. You are not so much on the edge of your seat as flung around it as the on-screen action endlessly spins and soars. ",
            "Basically perfect, even it is perfect at one of the worst sorts of things a movie can attempt.",
            "Among the first generation of films influenced by the cutting techniques of music videos, a progression of oversaturated, meaty images, embarrassing dialogue and awful music.",
            "Top Gun is about the training of the Navy's best fighter pilots and their blooding in cold war incidents, and the only thing Director Tony Scott has not brought up to date is the story.",
            "This paean to hotshot Navy fighter pilots and high technology attracted mass audiences despite its familiar plot and characters so vapid they vanish from memory as soon as the house lights come up.",
            "Every moment is hyped for maximum visual and visceral impact, but Scott doesn't display the slightest bit of interest (or belief) in the actual characters and situations.",
            "Tom Cruise classic still revs engines."

            "The supporting cast, the main players, and a singular script of revolution against convention allows the film to capture the spirit of crazy, carefree youth.",

            "Ferris Bueller's Day Off should warm the heart of every student who would love to play hooky from school. It also may bring back memories for grownups who think back to the good old days.",

            "This is a lark that I think you'll respond to and cheer on, a lark about one young man who goes to exaggerated lengths, fighting massive odds and disapproving, fearful people, to take a day off.",
            "Broderick is remarkably likeable as the arrogant, spoilt brat, Ruck is excellent as his melancholy friend and Jones almost steals the show.",
            "Ferris Bueller`s Day Off goes through the motions of enjoyable experiences without communicating much joy.",
            "A minor summertime diversion that could have been much more.",
            "A film that doesn't seem to know what it's about until the end.",
            "Proof, the best in the filmmaker's career, that a movie doesn't need to bend over backwards for Meaning to be absolutely great.",
            "Here is a dream as old as adolescence, and it is fun to be reminded of its ageless potency, especially in a movie as good-hearted as this one.",
            "its willingness to break convention and throw us into the fantastical, but strangely believable world of its characters makes Ferris Bueller not only Hughes's best teen films, but one of the best teen films ever made",
            "Hilarious comedy classic; language makes it PG-13.",
            "The quintessential teen comedy, this is a movie that could and should serve as a model for movies of this sort in the future.",

            "Watching Dale and Francis grow close is a subdued experience that evolves in quiet ways.",

            "The director's perenially heavy mood seems especially well suited to this indigo-shaded story of a black American saxman (Dexter Gordon) living and performing in Paris in the late 50s.",
            "Dale Turner, as played by Dexter Gordon, seems to be an amalgam of Bud Powell and Lester Young, but the private, rueful dignity that he brings to bear is all his own.",
            "No actor could do what the great jazz saxophonist Dexter Gordon does in 'Round Midnight.",
            "Gordon goes the limit as Turner, dedicating his performance to all the cats who've gone before.",
            "Wonderful offbeat homage to be-bop.",
            "Dexter Gordon received a Best Actor nomination and Herbie Hancock the Original Score Music Oscar for this moody jazz piece anout an alcoholic musician down on his luck.",
            "He's not just writing about a dying old man, he's writing about jazz.",
            "Tavernier's striking widescreen frame established the rainy, neon-and-smoke filled world of the jazz film.",
            "One of the best jazz films ever made, this succeeds by melding French sensibilities about atmosphere with American sensibilities about the music.",
            "It's a brooding yet warm elegy, as plaintive as a slow, low-toned ballad in a minor key.",
            "The film's quality lies not just in its vivid portrayal of the bebop milieu, but also in its sensitive examination of the turbulent forces within an artist compelled to create on a nightly basis, despite personal consequences.",
            "Guided by the spirit of the art form it celebrates, Tavernier's film is a mesmerizing audio-visual lament for the impending death of jazz",
            "You do not need to know a lot about jazz to appreciate what is going on because, in a certain sense, this movie teaches you everything about jazz that you really need to know.",
            "A lovingly gentle yet vibrant tribute to jazz, friendship and film itself, made by a director of consummate taste and precise imagination."

            "They are more than zombies doing needlepoint on each other's veins. Both are brought to life in complex, deeply felt performances from two actors who have abandoned themselves to enormously demanding and difficult roles.",
            "Every character is booked through to hell or purgatory. But we gasp at the inventiveness, ferocity and cuckoo anarchy with which these rockers prepared their route to destruction or damnation.",
            "Sid & Nancy is an honorable try, but it could have been better had Cox found a way to imbue the movie with some of the sheer zaniness of his Repo Man.",
            "Once we sense a glimmer of talent and accept these people as human beings, the tragedy of their drug use resonates enormously.",
            "This is a love story -- an unlikely, perverse, disturbing love story, but a genuine one.",
            "The film stars Gary Oldman as Sid and Chloe Webb as Nancy, both dialled up to 11 on the acting-ometer, perhaps as manic and irritating as their characters were.",
            "Neil Young may have namedropped Johnny Rotten in \"My My, Hey Hey\" but it's Vicious he was really singing about. ",
            "Sid and Nancy is a fascinating record of a volatile period in music history.",
            "Sid & Nancy is a brutal tour de force.",
            "There is some nobility in the film's relentlessness and single-minded focus, but not enough to redeem its lack of having anything much to say beyond what we get on the surface.",
            "Cox doesn't just plot an obvious decline: things do get grim, but he makes you care as you also despair for punk's cracked casualties.",
            "Even if \"Sid and Nancy\" doesn't quite represent the imperfect perfection in which punk music so often traffics, Alex Cox's confident visual symbolism -combined with Chloe Webb & Gary Oldman's performances -grant it piercing volume and knotty shape.",
            "Sid and Nancy has some claim on being the finest British film of the 1980s.",
            "Riveting and repulsive, with a claustrophobic perspective that mirrors its subjects: all id, all in the moment. But it's also shallow, all on the surface.",
            "At its best Sid & Nancy has a captivating energy and rawness, and there are even some priceless moments of levity.",
            "Repellent is the word for it, but the filmmakers might take that as a compliment, since hardcore sleaze is apparently what tickles them most.",
            "Oldman plays Vicious as awkward, insecure and violent; Webb's Spungen is tantrum-prone yet has a streak of generosity. They both seem very real, though neither will generate much sympathy.",
            "Sid and Nancy is a brilliantly acted surprise from newcomers Gary Oldman and Chloe Webb.",
            "It's a hard film to watch at times, as Vicious plunges deeper into his heroin-induced slump, but told with skill and compassion, which make up for the onscreen squalor.",
            "The great DOP Roger Deakins works hard to make cramped, dank interiors look cinematic. Cox's humour, meanwhile, compensates for the grim subject matter.",
            "A gruellingly tough watch.",
            "It is a reminder of what a dynamic presence Gary Oldman was in his younger days as he captures the snarling attitude of punk idol Sid Vicious.",
            "I think it's a near classic, well deserving of this rerelease.",
            "An inventive and energetic raggedy thing, made with a wide screen chutzpah rare in British film, and held together by a committed charismatic lead couple."

            "The best parts are, not surprisingly, the ample musical interludes. The character vignettes run hot and cold, with many registering as little more than quirky caricatures.",

            "Quirky David Byrne-helmed musical is all-ages appropriate.",
            "Byrne has made his version of Our Town for the 1980s, a glorification of commonplace--and kitch--and the resilient, inventive spirit of ordinary Americans wherever they are.",
            "A very quirky but not unkind take on American life that's Byrnian through and through.",

            "It was the tenderness of Desert Hearts that got me, the hope, and the idea that a woman didn't need to have it all nailed down by the time she hit 30, that a woman could give in to what she wanted and just figure it out as she went along",
            "I never wanted Desert Hearts to end.",
            "As enduringly tender as it is an important landmark in queer cinema, Desert Hearts remains sensual and provocative.",

            "All these years later, in an age where LGBTQIA+ stories are being normalized more and more in the mainstream, Desert Hearts still retains its power because its edges remain so daring.",
            "It's this evocation of a homophobia-free universe that elevates Desert Hearts from mere lesbian melodrama to the most tantalizing of wish-fulfillment fantasies.",
            "One of the film's most fascinating features is the use of rock and country music to build a world in which there are only two human conditions: romantic fulfillment, and romantic loneliness.",
            "In Desert Hearts, [Donna] Deitch takes lesbian cinema back to its future.",
            "Desert Hearts was an important, and beautiful, first step toward a movie world where LGBTQ couples were allowed unapologetically to be themselves.",

            "This new British picture raises enough issues for a half-dozen more conventional movies. And though this approach makes for a structure that's a little shaky, the film somehow holds together.",
            "Director Stephen Frears and screenwriter Hanif Kureishi are better at depicting a new milieu than in making an important or innovative statement.",
            "Despite its irregularities, the film is worth watching. It is lively and truthful. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Not only is it a brilliant take on star-crossed lovers, it doesn't take the twists and turns you'd expect a story like this to take. ",
            "Would that all socially relevant cinematic documents were also such good movies!",
            "Besides being revelatory in its depiction of a gay relationship, its respectful, yet unfawning, look at immigrants trying to make it in a new country is straight out of the headlines.",
            "How many times in the history of the medium have we seen a single film rattle as many socio-cinematic paradigms-and done it with as much brio-as My Beautiful Laundrette (1985)?",
            "... unfolds with a refreshing honesty and a sense of surprise to it; being handled more like something embedded within the characters rather than a plot point thrown in just to bring up an issue or an easy conflict point.",
            "The odious Margaret Thatcher and her crippling policies made sizable targets for many British filmmakers during the 1980s and beyond, and few hit the bulls-eye as squarely as screenwriter Hanif Kureishi and director Stephen Frears with this indie hit.",
            "This seminal 1980s movie launched a plethora of now distinguished careers, including those of director Stephen Frears and Daniel Day-Lewis.",
            "There isn't a performance in this film that is less than excellent.",
            "Expertly acted throughout, this remains a definitive snapshot of British life in the 1980s.",
            "[VIDEO ESSAY] \"My Beautiful Launderette\" is a milestone of British cinema. ",
            "An intriguing tale about race, sexuality, and politics in the New London, splendidly played by Daniel day Lewis as the gay punk.",
            "As always, director Stephen Frears does a superb job of work when given a good script, and this is a very good script.",
            "The strength of the film is its vision -- cutting, compassionate and sometimes hilarious -- of what it means to be Asian, and British, in Thatcher's Britain."

            "Beinex's Oscar-nominated, quintessentially French amour fou tells of a love relationship that descends into madness, splendidly played by Dalle as the free-spirited troubled femme; one scene of self-inflicted violence is truly tough to watch.",
            "Occasionally drags and meanders, but it boasts an impressive visual style and a radiant, charismatic performance by the ultra-sexy B\u00e9atrice Dalle.",
            "Expanded to its intended length, the movie feels not like a failed narrative hastily washed in luridness but a purposefully meandering allegory of artistic frustration.",

            "If Dalle never made anything of note again -- and she didn't -- then this alone would be enough to stake her claim as an icon of late 20th century cinema.",

            "Working with his crack technical team, Scorsese turns the film into a high-wire act, using everything from the crack of the balls to the soundtrack (best bit: Cruise playing and preening to Warren Zevon's \"Werewolves of London\") to pump up the action.",

            "The whole film seems ideologically forced and out of place, an attempt to resurrect the retentive virtues of Ford and Hawks without the cultural context that gave them expressive strength.",
            "Heartbreak Ridge offers another vintage Clint Eastwood performance.",
            "The film belongs to Eastwood. Now looking increasingly like an Easter Island statue, he has a voice pickled in bourbon, a tongue like razor wire, and a body so full of shrapnel that he can't walk through airport metal detectors.",
            "As the gritty, raspy-voiced sergeant, Mr. Eastwood's performance is one of the richest he's ever given.",
            "An unusually thoughtful look (and a broad one) at powers on the wane, at America's shift from Vietnam polarisations to 80's apathy, and at one man teetering on the brink of a lonely old age.",
            "There's a by-the-numbers feel to it all, but Eastwood is the main reason to watch, as he whips the troops into shape in readiness for the invasion of Grenada.",
            "Screenwriter Jim Carabatsos (yes, the very guy who wrote No Mercy) is a Vietnam vet. Yet he seems to have no idea of how men fight, get along or talk.",
            "A drama that gets you in totally without you ever realising it.",
            "What elevates the film are its dead-on verisimilitude about 1980s military culture, its lightly-worn insights into the larger issues at stake, and its precision-lathed dialogue, which is smart but never smarmy.",
            "Set during the Grenada War, Clint Eastwood's war movie is a formulaic, old-fashioned actioner wearing its ideology on its sleeves.",
            "You may not always like Eastwood's films, but you seldom get downright bored by them.",
            "For a war film, Heartbreak Ridge is oddly lighter in spirit than many of Eastwood's other films from this period.",
            "Clint Eastwood is at his macho, insubordinate best in this exuberant, salty military movie with more memorable lines and funny moments than most comedies.",
            "Eastwood's clearly having a ball as a gravel-throated solider man.",
            "We have seen this story in a hundred other movies ... But Eastwood, as the producer, director and star, caresses the material as if he didn't know B movies have gone out of style."

            "...an affable yet somewhat forgettable endeavor predominantly dominated by cookie-cutter elements...",
            "Even if it falls apart a bit at the end, it is basically a well-crafted and entertaining film. But I cannot help but be distressed by the fact that... the female time-traveler is passive in and little enriched by her re-exploration of the past.",
            "No masterpiece, but it at least imparts an important perspective about nostalgia.",
            "The film often soars into the imaginary heavens of delight but then just as quickly sputters and crash lands due to Coppola's leaden helming.",
            "A charming little comedy grounded in an irresistable performance from Kathleen Turner.",
            "The movie has many lovely moments and just as many dead spots, but its strengths make this atypical film from Francis Coppola a worthwhile viewing experience.",
            "Centering on a female protag (well-played by Kathleen Turner) and dealing with a similar universal fantasy of revisiting your past, Coppola's small-town fable is a wonderful companion piece to Back to the Future, which was released a year earlier.",
            "Coppola displays a rare light and comedic touch in this charmer.",
            "Nicolas Cage lets the comedy rip. \"You mean my wang?\"",
            "One of the best romantic comedies of the 80's....\"Back to the Future\" meets \"Somewhere in Time\"",
            "A very entertaining and involving movie boasting a cornucopia of delightful comic moments and scenes which go straight for the heart.",
            "Twisted, touching and a great vehicle for Turner",
            "A glimpse of James Carrey",
            "One of Coppola's least overbearing films, but not overwhelmingly good.",
            "Peggy Sue Got maried isn't a perfect film, but it sure makes you feel good."

            "As irresistibly sweet as cotton candy.",
            "First-Timer Howard Deutch is a nice surprise too. His precise, unexploitative direction is sympathetic to the awkward pauses in teen talk, to the mopery of first love, to the suicidal bravado of words spoken in heat.",
            "These kids have a bumpy ride, but this is one film that identifies with their passions instead of indulging them, giving us a perfect back-seat view of kids out cruising, not for kicks but for a hard-earned sense of pride.",
            "It's way too hackneyed for John Hughes. He's already shown us that he knows better.",
            "Sports such a bland narrative it seems the equivalent of unseasoned potatoes. Yes, Ringwald is watchable and her sequences with Harry Dean Stanton do move towards the requisite poignancy we expect. ",
            "There are certainly funny moments and one completely out-of-place Ferris Bueller-esque breakage of the fourth wall, but otherwise Pretty in Pink is quite serious about its business.",
            "Hughes' utterly formulaic screenplay is largely saved by the bright '80s aesthetics as well as most of the cast. The litmus test is Cryer as Duckie -- you either find his antics amusing and adorable or maddening and moronic. (I fall into the latter camp.)",
            "Ringwald has an inner strength about her that makes Andie so resilient even when she is crying her eyes out.",
            "Pretty in Pink lacks the originality of Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club, but Hughes infuses just enough unique elements like... Ringwald's signature pout to churn out one of the best teen movies ever made.",
            "Dated high school tale is still fun for teens.",
            "When Molly Ringwald and Annie Potts are onscreen together, the movie is aglow. See Pretty In Pink or, years from now, you may suffer side effects from missing it.",
            "Its deceptively soft title is a mask for a fairly powerful and pointed commentary on social standards, class differences and facades.",
            "Deutch has no discernible style; the scenes march ahead with only one development per scene, much like the worst in American television.",
            "Pretty in Pink is an engaging movie about youthful concerns that never go out of fashion.",
            "Unfortunately she gets straitjacketed in her current movie by a script that settles for black-and-white pronouncements instead of the delicate shades of gray that Ringwald employs.",
            "It belts along pleasingly enough, but this frenetic, hard-edged comedy drama is too hackneyed to be entirely successful.",
            "Hughes' penetrating insight into the minds of 1980s kids makes this one of the best films to bear his name.",
            "Sweet but predictible angst-ridden Brat Pack outing.",
            "A grubby and even nasty movie in its understanding of class structure, of culture and counter-culture and the ways that teenagers can destroy one another over the subtle distinctions therein.",
            "Pretty in Pink is clich\u00e9d, stereotyped, remarkably sentimental, and sweet as all get-out.",
            "Pretty in Pink is a rather intelligent (if not terribly original) look at adolescent insecurities.",

            "Although Platoon is not the easiest film to watch, it is one of the best at reminding us that the cinema is not always interested in evading or distorting history. Sometimes it tells the truth.",
            "This film is an act of courage. Stone, the gutsy writer-director, records in a devastating barrage of images the relentless horror and the senseless carnage experienced by far too many Americans in Vietnam.",
            "Stone's strongest suit, however, isn't so much realism as it is his way of blending immediacy and insight.",
            "There are images in Platoon so powerful that they seem, rather than simply imprinted on celluloid, to have been burned into memory.",
            "Precisely because Stone forces you to experience a grunt's tunnel vision and rage, Platoon is a film of inspiring empathy and awesome force. Curiously, that same tunnelvision in the end compromises Platoon.",
            "This is movie-making with a zealot's fervor.",
            "It's extremely violent and brutal, yet tragically realistic.",
            "Platoon (1986) is a harrowing, visceral, ultra-realistic, gutsy, visually-shattering Vietnam-war film, based on the writer/director's own first-hand knowledge as a Vietnam combat-infantry soldier. The insightful Best Picture-winning war film",
            "Oliver Stone based his movie on his own experiences and attempted to make a more \"realistic\" Vietnam movie, simpler and more grounded than things like Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter... and he succeeds, truly making this war look like hell.",
            "For a while Platoon amazes. Its authenticity and dark, dramatic tone promise a great deal... But the characters gradually disappear into formula and action into melodrama.",
            "It's not a film that will make film history, but intelligently takes advantage of that history to provide a shred of light to a sordid and still American debate. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "Platoon is not the definitive Vietnam statement that Stone may have intended, or that others are already claiming it to be. But it is a powerful document about that sad war, and a riveting piece of moviemaking.",
            "The utter chaos of war in Vietnam is brilliantly portrayed. No one can deny this film the power of its images and the weight of all-pervasive terror it creates.",
            "This is a modern classic and a personal exorcism for its director.",
            "Oliver Stone tries ambitiously to capture the full horror and frenzy of combat in Southeast Asia, but his technical skill outstrips his insight.",
            "No sane person should want to get any closer to war than this film.",
            "One of the best Vietnam films out there. And this is coming from a person who thinks that modern-day filmmaker Oliver Stone is a big, fat windbag.",
            "Platoon is filled with one fine performance after another, and one can only wish that every person who saw the cartoonish war fantasy that was Rambo would buy a ticket to Platoon and bear witness to something closer to the truth.",
            "The grisly reality is brought to life by Stone's dialogue and emotion-charged combat scenes, raising thought-provoking questions of morality in this still-resonant classic.",
            "Vietnam seems to have made [Stone] a better filmmaker -- his next movies should tell us whether, in the best war-movie tradition, it's also made a man out of him. ",
            "Stone, who's known for his excess, offers a few voiceover lines that border on the cheesy, but other than that it's a pretty straightforward realistic tour of duty. And that's what makes it so powerful.",
            "Remains an intriguing blend of the political and the personal, with Stone turning his memories and his opinions about Vietnam into potent drama. [Blu-ray]",
            "No war movie is truly an anti-war movie, but PLATOON comes close, and it's still as powerful as it was decades ago.",
            "Platoon is different. It matters."

            "Perfection is boring, but boring is the very last word to describe Hannah and Her Sisters, which just may be a perfect movie.",
            "Hannah and Her Sisters is structured ingeniously so that seemingly separate stories eventually merge in satisfying ways.",
            "Hannah and Her Sisters is also filmmaking of consummate skill and emotional range. It encompasses brilliant comedy and almost unbearable poignance -- often in the same scene.",
            "Brilliant but mature comic-drama about an imperfect family.",
            "This gifted ensemble works hard to make Hannah and Her Sisters the best movie of the year so far, perhaps the best that Allen has ever made.",
            "Allen`s ear for the strained marital conversation, the fury of a breakup and the tentativeness of starting a romance is impeccable.",

            "at the very least a conversation starter",
            "Caine's performance, so fervent, so agonisingly dedicated, actually gains in force and touching sincerity with the years.",
            "The tangled web of relationships is very effectively done, but just as affecting is Allen's portrayal of the city he loves.",
            "Its plot has the elegant geometry of a Philip Barry play.",
            "The comedy-drama succeeds as a sharply pointed portrait of sibling rivalry.",
            "Sharply written and extremely well-acted (Wiest and Caine won Supporting Oscars), Allen's serio-comic ensemble saga about one large neurotic family, was a huge artistic and commercial hit at the time, and arguably his last truly great picture.",
            "Allen's way of setting himself up as a fount of moral wisdom is as insufferable as ever, but at least the preachiness is alleviated by some genuine wit.",
            "One of Woody's best ever; a highly intelligent and witty comedy with a magical script and perfect portrayls of well rounded characters.",

            "Scene to scene, encounter to encounter, its tension builds unrelentingly. So, fasten your seat belts. It`s a blast.",
            "[Aliens] is a spectacular example of state-of-the-art science fiction simply because it never tries to be overtly spectacular.",
            "It's blaster action, not Gothic future-horror. Fortunately, director-screenwriter James Cameron has shaped his film around the defiant intelligence and sensual athleticism of Weaver, and that's where Aliens works best.",
            "This film is also the best monster movie of the year and the best picture of any kind to open so far this summer. Put it another way: Aliens is the Jaws of the '80s.",
            "Perhaps the greatest exemplar of science-fiction, action, and horror faultlessly blended together into one film.",

            "The moment the action is situated in Acheron everything is simplified and loses its mystery. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Eschewing the claustrophobic foreboding of Alien, Cameron takes all the anxieties and fears that had been built in the original and refracts it through his action movie sensibilities to create a smart action thriller.",
            "At any rate, it's an exciting and well-made film, inspires great conversations, and presents some of the most appealing women characters in the movies.",
            "(Sigourney) Weaver proves to be a formidable action hero.. One of just a few females in a film filled with aggro males, she doesn't just hold her own, she owns the movie.",
            "It's so rare to see a sequel live up and maybe surpass (depending on if you like your horror with plenty of action or not) the original, but Aliens does...",
            "Under [James] Cameron's care, Aliens emerges as that rarest of sequels that, if not surpassing its predecessor, stands comfortably alongside it as an equal.",
            "The whole finale is white-knuckled, some of the best aciton and suspense film-making I've ever seen.",
            "Cameron's film is a lot of fun for what it is, a bonanza of brash action sequences and delicious camaraderie. It proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that while nobody can hear you scream in space, they can certainly hear you shoot.",
            "An excellent science fiction, horror, action AND war film.",
            "Much more high energy but just as sophisticated as the original...",
            "A subtle, spooky movie with teeth becomes a subtlety-bashing war movie.",
            "The first of these movies remains one of the great sci-fi horror achievements of the modern cinema, but its sequel, \"Aliens,\" is that rare instance where a follow-up deviates from the formula and finds an effective rhythm in propelling the story",
            "The idea behind Aliens remains the scariest, dirtiest, most perversely funny one for a monster film, and the Rambo action further gooses us.",
            "The result is a film that not only answers many questions raised by the original story, but also expands production values, amplifies special effects and weaves a new plot that is even more exciting than the first.",
            "Surpassing its predecessor in terms of sheer spectacle, this sequel to Ridley Scott's outer-space nightmare from director James Cameron is an outstanding science-fiction thriller.",
            "So much for the theory that sequels never equal the original."

            "If there is more than a little something borrowed from Spielberg, Kleiser's movie is amiably undemanding entertainment that says the right things, albeit without great originality.",
            "There's no mistaking Flight of the Navigator for a really first-rate children's picture like, say, The Black Stallion. But Flight of the Navigator is an enjoyable film that encourages kids to use their heads.",
            "Whereas its plot may be derivative--and at several junctures, unconvincing--\"Flight of the Navigator\" nevertheless manages to develop considerable humor and poignancy from David's predicament and what he does about it.",
            "This children's adventure turns out to be, despite its title, less of a Star Wars trip than an entertaining variation on the time-travel adventure Back to the Future.",
            "When you add up all the evidence, Flight of the Navigator remains one of the most underrated pinnacles of the sci-fi genre, a euphoric mix of pop culture nostalgia and feel-good entertainment.",
            "Flight of the Navigator, the Disney studio's new movie aimed at children, has the warmed-over feeling of other time-travel yarns. But the story is snappily told and is sure to keep youngsters enthralled.",
            "Flight of the Navigator is almost like two movies in one -- a creepy sci-fi mystery and a BFF road trip comedy all squished up together.",
            "Appealing children's sci-fi fantasy film, that follows the squeaky-clean Disney formula.",
            "The brain-assaulting sci-fi second half of Flight of the Navigator is made palpable by Cramer, who deftly conveys anguish during the first half. Now, he wants to go home and his gung-ho attitude makes every dumb effect exciting.",
            "Flight of the Navigator, in spite of a rough beginning, soars as it should, taking a child on the journey of his life.",
            "The early CG FX have aged remarkably well, while the slow build-up makes the Spielbergian space adventure all the more fantastic.",
            "This appealing children's adventure has just enough quirky touches to keep adults involved as well.",
            "Cramer gives a spirited performance as the title character. Director Randal Kleiser uses a deft touch with his material. The result is a Navigator that's out-of-this-world fun for adults as well as children.",
            "Not a particularly original or insightful film of its kind, and marred slightly by the whining of Cramer in the lead role, this is nevertheless enjoyable fare for kids.",
            "Never brave enough to feel far-reaching (or, ironically, far-fetched, when time-travel and space flight are so popular at the movies), Navigator still fulfills its mission, distracting the family for bang-on an hour and a half.",
            "An exciting time travel adventure.",

            "I don't want to remember any more about Legend than to make sure I include it in my ''worst films of 1986'' list and never rent it when it comes out as a video cassette.",
            "Legend may turn out to be legendary, but not in the way the filmmakers intended.",
            "Legend is a fairytale produced on a grand scale... At the same time, the basic premise is alarmingly thin, a compendium of any number of ancient fairytales.",
            "Beautifully shot and designed, but in a cloyingly self-conscious manner, the film lacks narrative drive.",
            "Legend is a disaster in a lot of ways, but it's an attractive one that's a lot more fun than many other serious movies.",
            "It's all flash and no flesh. But in the hands of a visual director like Scott, sometimes that's enough.",
            "Best known as the movie that was filming at Pinewood when the James Bond stage burned down, this is probably one of the few films on director Ridley Scott's CV that he would prefer to forget.",

            "Sumptuous, grandly-scaled, and often ludicrous.",
            "The sets, makeup and photography in Ridley Scott's contribution to the fantasy cycle are awesome, but the dialogue and acting are more fitted to the pantomime stage.",
            "Its production design, special effects, and overall look can't be faulted. But its hackneyed story about good versus evil is so insipid and dull that no matter how much one might applaud the visual achievement, the movie is still a gigantic bore.",
            "Dark and often scary '80s fantasy hasn't aged well.",
            "A remarkable and bleak fantasy thriller for folks that like their fantasy based on thick characterization and less humongous battles.",
            "Ultimately Legend is a bit of a wet squib, appealing in small doses but struggling to maintain audience interest for the full running time.",
            "With such spectacular visuals, quality of performance isn't really the point here, but an unrecognisable Curry is excellent.",

            "Buy a ticket to this whirligig of a movie at your own risk. You enter a fun house and exit through a chamber of horrors. But director Jonathan Demme provides a heck of a ride.",
            "As an artefact from a period -- the mid-80s -- that produced almost nothing distinctive, this remains breezy fun.",
            "Something Wild is fun, at first. Then it becomes deadly and weird and engrossing. Predictable it is not.",
            "Something Wild is an excellent movie about the fragility of people's images. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "It's a rather routine storyline that's perpetually employed to striking, enthralling effect by Demme...",
            "The end's not unexpected, and the soundtrack's overloaded with songs, but once Something Wild gets really wild -- with Daniels and Griffith and Demme's fringe comedy at their best -- the movie makes its mark as offbeat entertainment.",
            "Part screwball comedy and part thriller, the unpredictable turns of Something Wild indeed chart its characters' untamed, untapped inner resources. ",
            "Something Wild is undoubtedly a minor work in the oeuvre of all its major players, yet it is never less than charming, and at times is almost inspired. ",
            "Captures the tension of trying to stand out in cookie-cutter world without alienating everyone around you.",
            "Radiantly human even as, and after, it erupts in violence and rage, \"Something Wild\" remains an astonishing rarity - a bittersweet romantic tragicomedy that's generally optimistic ... but also hesitant and harmful exactly where it needs to be.",
            "The tones shift rampantly, which for some viewers can be disorienting and off-putting. But, if you're in tune with Demme's aesthetic, which usually runs counter to our cinematic intuition, it is a wild ride indeed. ",
            "If you don't already know where it ends up then I assure you that you have no idea where it's going to end up.",
            "A fun, offbeat, and mildly subversive comedy ... with unexpected twists and ... a real sense of danger.",
            "The third film in Demme's Small-Town America trilogy (the other two are Handle With Care and Melvin and Howard) centers on a new screen type, the yuppie (played to perfection by Jeff Daniels); change of tone from comedy to horror is tough but well-earned",
            "Demme keeps his quirky narrative twisting and turning so that the viewer can never predict what will happen next.",
            "An expert and truly unpredictable blend of comedy and menace.",
            "A cool, crazy cack!"

            "The chainsaw brood has become bumbling, incompetent, and laughable, focused intently on sudden scenes of intense brutality rather than the careful building of dread.",

            "Sure, there's a lot more gore and some chainsaw violence paying off for what wasn't seen in its predecessor, but this leaves a lot to be desired when all is said and done",
            "Seems intent on mocking the first film, rather than paying respect to it and sewing a new narrative.",

            "A good deal gorier and more disturbing than the original. Certainly it's far better than the soulless 2003 remake.",

            "Thank god the Transformers speak primarily in proper nouns--if they hadn't shouted \"Optimus! Megatron!\" every time they struck a blow, I'd have no idea what was happening.",
            "For the bot-neutral rest of us, two-and-a-half hours of mostly incoherent special effects may be a bit much.",
            "I challenge you to name another movie about an alien robot come to save the world while disguised as a yellow Camaro. Isn't it just an intergalactic Herbie the Love Bug?",
            "Films directed by Michael Bay are usually like being shouted at by a halfwit for two and a half hours, and Transformers is no exception.",
            "It's outrageous, stupid fun and you should see it on the biggest screen you can find.",
            "It's a big, cool, dopey, noisy, non-stop action powerhouse. It's also too long by a half hour and it left my ears ringing, but it's a lot of fun.",
            "Adrenaline-soaked fight sequences and massively destructive gunplay push Michael Bay's riveting robot orgy into a new sector of action epics.",
            "Transformers is the quintessential summer blockbuster -- full of nonstop action, sly humor and eye-popping special effects that easily distance it from the rest of the crowded pack of big-budget must-sees.",
            "Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow!",
            "Bay manages to tap into the child in all of us despite the film's awkward form and ridiculous script.",
            "The special effects are extraordinary. The transformations of the vehicles to robots are without fault. The protagonists... are pleasing on the eye and have problems that any teenager can relate to. ",
            "Transformers gives you pretty much exactly what you want from a summer movie. It's big, it's loud, and boy-howdy is it dumb -- but it's also unquestionably fun. ",
            "It's not that Bay's vision for the robot-battle choreography is unimaginative. Rather, he lacks imagination to provide viewers with a way of putting all the pieces together for themselves. ",
            "Transformers leaves very few blocks left un-busted.",
            "hat was delivered will no doubt send merchandising sales spiralling into orbit, but sadly at the cost of countless brain cells popping through after nearly two and a half hours of tedium.",
            "Transformers delivers on its promise of stunning visuals and well-crafted action sequences, but it's not remotely worth the slog it takes to get there. Once the novelty of the robots wears off it's hopelessly insipid.",
            "Bay, of course, can't resists temptation to use as many explosions in the film as possible",
            "Morphs from Army-enlisting ad to toy ad (on its way passing through a panoply of car ads, computer ads, beer ads) without ever becoming a movie",
            "Transformers is a rollicking, rousing experience.",
            "It is a teenage boy's wet dream. The girls are insanely hot, the lead is awkward/funny and the action sequences are top notch.",
            "...if you are an adult and not already a fan, you may find the movie more than a bit long, loud, and frenzied.",
            "Come to think of it, I was pretty stupid when I was six years old. So is this film."
