            "\"Back to the Future\" is the best comic-strip movie I've seen this year. It's well-made, lighthearted and is exactly the right length to give you excitement and laughs and a few surprises, and then it's over, leaving you feeling good.",
            "Zemeckis and Gale have cannily chosen the time periods, which are funny as much for their similarities (political and materalistic) as their contrasts (music, fashions, language). ",
            "Though it is hardly one of the greater flights of cinematic imagination to be seen since science fantasy reared its head as mass appeal material again, it would be virtually impossible not to enjoy it in some way or another.",
            "Every bit as classy, clever and cockle-warming as it was 30 years ago.",
            "Kids and parents alike are gonna dig this wonderful fantasy.",
            "Zemeckis and Gale have given the movie a core of feeling that makes real claims on us. For all its comedy, Back to the Future is about a kid coming to terms with his parents' inadequacies, a moment familiar to everyone, and the fulcrum in growing up.",
            "Fox, who was doing double duty while making the first film (he was still working on his sitcom, Family Ties at the same time) was the perfect Marty.",
            "By far one of the most competent time travel movies ever made, addressing even the most common loopholes and pitfalls.",
            "It is the perfect package of entertainment, drama, comedy, excitement, and heart, wrapped up in special effects that still look convincing.",
            "The play on culture swaps is neatly done, and director Robert Zemeckis keeps it all fairytale-like and family friendly.",
            "One of the few perfect films that truly deserves to sit on the pedestal it rests on. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "There isn't a wasted scene.",
            "The 1985 original, in which Marty and Doc zoom 30 years back to 1955, remains the best.",
            "A great mix of fantasy, humor and drama, with a light tone but not in a ridiculous way and with well built characters you can identify with. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "This fusion of sci-fi, action, romance and comedy could have been a dreadful mess, were it not for writer-director Robert Zemeckis and co-writer Bob Gale's refusal to let a loose line or idea escape their pens.",
            "The humour, the pathos, the tension - even the blooming soundtrack - all conspire to ensure that the tale of a teenager traveling back 30 years to ensure his parents meet and ultimately mate can, given its vintage, now be fairly described as a classic.",
            "Under the splendid direction of Robert Zemeckis, who also co-authored the screenplay with Bob Gale, Back to the Future is a joyous flight into the domain of a teen-ager`s fantasy.",
            "Just sign on for the trip. Back to the Future offers the summer's most dazzling joyride.",
            "It isn't often that extremely clever moviemakers use their brains in the service of pure fun. But that's just what the people who made Back to the Future have done. This brilliant contraption of a film could become the hit of the summer.",
            "It's big, cartoonish and empty, with an interesting premise that is underdeveloped and overproduced.",
            "It's great fun most of the way and makes up in humor what it lacks in sense.",
            "Zemeckis and Gale... give us two priceless scenes in which the young time-traveler simply regards his parents-to-be with wonderment, delight and empathy. And we cannot help but share that emotion and relate it to our own lives.",
            "It was, is and always will be a true Hollywood classic.",
            "The most commercially popular of 1985."

            "The nihilism and the vicious intensity of Mr. Voight's performance here are entirely different from anything else he has done on screen; it's a shame those qualities emerge in such a vigorous but disjointed film.",

            "It's one of the most beautiful and slickly produced pieces of reactionary junk food cinema ever made, and it's glorious.",
            "It's a great, simple story, and, in the history of action movies, ought to be considered alongside Die Hard and Speed. ",
            "A terrific mix of tightly coiled action and psychoanalysis that has no place in a genre film from the '80s, but works splendidly regardless.",
            "A thunderous proto-Speed with exploitation trappings, it also works as an existential art movie with a serious director and a dusted-off Akira Kurosawa script.",
            "A gripping action thriller that's also extremely well acted by Jon Voight and Eric Roberts in Oscar-nominated performances.",
            "While RUNAWAY TRAIN does balance action and philosophy quite neatly it's still intriguing to wonder how differently Kurosawa would have handled it",

            "This could be Bob Hope material c1942 and Chase does acquit himself well (though with cool reserve) in the gags-to-plot transitions. What dulls the enterprise is that Ritchie so keeps his distance from every character.",
            "Whenever the move threatens to work, there's Chevy Chase with his monotone, deadpan cynicism, distancing himself from the material.",

            "As Chevy Chase's best starring vehicle, it inverts the novels' occasional darkness into a quick-witted quip machine. But that energy feels appropriately extemporaneous here in making defenses fall or hackles rise. Either way, Fletch gets the story.",
            "What truly holds Fletch together isn't the somewhat off-putting Chase--whose screen presence was always defined by a love-it-or-hate it smugness--but his time-tested collaborators: screenwriter Bergman...and director Michael Ritchie...[Blu-ray]",

            "To call \"Re-Animator\" campy and leave it at that seems a knee-jerk reaction to discredit, or disregard, the clear skill behind an excellent American horror movie. Even at its most outrageous, it's controlled by a steady, confident hand with a plan.",

            "Despite a pacy, technically brilliant but otherwise slightly ordinary first half-hour or so, Scorsese's Howard Hughes movie is his best since The Age of Innocence.",
            "Scorsese gives us a lot more than the Charles Foster Kane of the clouds. He keeps focus on Hughes, the dreamer, who continually reached out, grabbed the future and pulled it toward him.",
            "At the epicentre of this movie maelstrom is an assured and adroit performance by Leonardo DiCaprio.",
            "What constitutes risk in acting? What Blanchett does here as Hepburn, daring to take on an icon in the same medium for which she was known and celebrated.",
            "The Aviator is a flawed but incredibly passionate and entertaining film befitting a character as flamboyant as Hughes.",
            "Leonardo DiCaprio meticulously depicts the maverick entrepreneur in all his guises -- from the off, he cleverly conveys (through body language) the ailments that would beset Hughes -- noticeably OCD and deafness. It's a stunning performance.",
            "Is really little more than three hours of the director polishing his mantel in anticipation of an Oscar.",
            "The dramatic conceit that a great, obsessive personality begets an obsessive, dysfunctional personal life and frail mental well-being just isn't that nuanced or tragic.",
            "Solidly entertaining and visually lush, but this is uncharacteristically safe territory for a filmmaker who relishes risk and grittiness.",
            "This is high-style filmmaking wrapped up in a tormented hero whose soaring flights of greatness are matched by the mortal pull of his devils,...",
            "It's all rather sprawling and a bit disjointed, but Scorsese's vigorous pacing and eye for detail hold it all together and provide a vivid setting for DiCaprio's masterful performance (his best work yet).",
            "Scorsese's most engaged and engaging filmmaking in a while.",
            "Its plot moves from event to event without a story driving it and the audience is left drifting along.",

            "It plays like a bad B-movie where we suddenly leave an ongoing conversation to join a fight in progress.",
            "It's silly, at times laughable, sure, but Jaa has a reckless, bone-cracking grace that transcends the film's triviality. For fight fans, he's worth the price of admission.",

            "Moore is worth every wrinkle on his face in \"A View to a Kill,\" the seventh movie he has made in the Bond series and the most enjoyable since \"Moonraker\" back in the '70s.",
            "The film also fails on other traditional Bond levels. For example, the gadgets. Zorin and his gang have an inflatable dirigible, but so what? The key to the best Bond gadgets has been that they were something you might want to own yourself.",
            "It's not double-oh-seven anymore, but double-oh-seventy, the best argument yet for the mandatory retirement age.",
            "Hard as it is to justify Bond films on intellectual grounds, there's something invigorating -- and strangely reassuring -- about this sort of picture.",
            "This one, directed by John Glen, just follows the numbers, plodding from one unimaginative set piece to the next.",
            "It is exhausted and exhausting, an old joke retold once too often.",
            "The primary villain is memorably vicious and well acted, the henchmen and their demises are bombastic and amusing, and the set pieces are extravagantly grandiose.",
            "It will always be my ultimate guilty pleasure Bond film",
            "Where other Bond films at least have a kitsch quality, A View to a Kill is not only silly but it also commits the ultimate cardinal sin for any Bond movie - it's boring.",
            "A good Bond film, filled with plenty of action and set pieces, with a great opening theme to boot! A solid note to go out on for Moore, even if he isn't a highlight himself...",
            "If [the Bond films] don't accept the convenience of retirement, which is not expected, they will stop being shows for adults with childlike spirits and become scandalous cases of corruption for minors. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "While it doesn't reach its full potential, Roger Moore's final 007 outing is still a largely entertaining if admittedly flawed adventure. ",
            "An arthritic thriller that forgets where it put the excitement and infamously transforms Bond into a quiche cooking homebody.",
            "The plot doesn't really convince, perhaps because we've seen it or something similar so many times before.",
            "A View to a Kill plods along dutifully, observing the rules of the series with dull consistency.",
            "The strain is starting to show on 007.",
            "Tired 007 effort has ridiculous plot, iffy behavior.",
            "This time around, 007 is a paunchy old man looking like he needs to retire. The film has little energy, thrills or fun, which is essential for a Bond film. The series has now reached an all time low.",
            "Contrary to historical opinion and some truly awful movies, Moore conjured roguish magic over his 12-year tenure. His Bond cast the spell that initially charmed me as a kid - one perhaps so intoxicating to him that it was simply hard to let go.",
            "What says \"outlandishly dumb action film from 1985\" better than a plot to flood Silicon Valley and corner the world's microchip market?",
            "This Bond eats quiche.",
            "A View to a Kill is not the worst Bond film ever made, but it's closer to the bottom than to the top of the barrel.",
            "A workmanlike entry brings Moore's long and increasingly tired tenure to a close.",
            "Roger Moore's last Bond and not before time."

            "Paul Schrader's 1985 biopic necessarily guts his controversial life - but the visual style is superb.",
            "Graced with a throbbing orchestral score from Philip Glass and John Bailey's luminous photography, this is appropriately monumental filmmaking.",
            "The gorgeous, artsy 1985 biopic Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters is the best movie that Paul Schrader has yet directed.",
            "A very stylish, if emotionally constrained film.",
            "Playing like a more comprehensible version of the sort of stylistic biopic one would expect from Ken Russell, Mishima is a heady, visual assault, a presentation of cinema as fetishistic as its subject",
            "A Life in Four Chapters is an example of an artistic expression so compelling that it - perhaps particularly for more distant Western observers - transcends many of the complex, difficult, and politically-charged circumstances which surrounded it.",
            "As Mishima imagines his new trajectory through the upper atmosphere, Mishima finds its own resting place, and the sleepy drone of Glass's organs swells on the soundtrack, both eerie and comforting--anthem, hymn, and requiem.",
            "If one cannot seriously address the sexuality of a man who was so obviously obsessed and driven by sex, then why bother making a film of his life at all?",
            "The storylines are often overwhelmed by the sheer magnificence of the visual approach.",
            "From Philip Glass's glorious score to John Bailey's rich cinematography, Schrader's movie is never less than ravishing.",
            "Philip Glass's score still takes the breath away.",
            "Those unfamiliar with Mishima's work may find the expressionistic novel sequences overly rich, but Schrader's film is a visually arresting, imaginative and intelligent overview of a difficult subject.",
            "The cerebral cool of Schrader's perspective sacrifices emotional connection to its subject.",
            "It's Mishima's diagrammatic structure that most perfectly suits its subject, defined by his will to harmony.",
            "It's fetishistic, lyrical, narcissistic and, at key moments, borderline berserk. In other words, the movie captures its subject to a tee.",
            "Offers a mesmerizing profile of the famous Japanese writer whose life was filled with drama."

            "The movie is almost uncanny in its self-assurance, in the way it knows that the first hour, where 'nothing' happens, is necessary if the payoff is to be tragic, instead of merely sensational.",
            "Plays uncomfortably like two movies jammed into one.",
            "Chopra has a precise eye for the vagaries of young adulthood, an Dern perfectly embodies the push-pull between Connie's curiosity and desire and the often-intimidating reality of adulthood.",
            "Remains one of the most insightful and harrowing examinations of American adolescence ever put on film. ",
            "With its unlikely note of resolution, the coda in particular belies the adaptation's larger insistence on nuance, ambiguity, what even a young girl knows, without knowing, to be irresolvable.",
            "A gorgeous, thrilling portrayal of careless childhood dissolving in the summer sun, Smooth Talk is a landmark coming-of-age film and signals the arrival of one of cinema's favorite stars.",
            "Chopra's film is a fascinating time capsule.",
            "As Springsteen sang, 'the door's open but the ride, it ain't free.'",
            "Disregard the incoherent ending, which violates the source material (Joyce Carol Oates story): in her debut, Chopra has made a disturbing tale of sexual awakening set against the 1980s new context of shopping malls; Laura Dern is extraordinary as the lead",
            "Despite the less-than-riveting vibe, it's impossible to deny Dern's amazing performance.",
            "Offers ample and telling observations on adolescence, mother-daughter relationships, familial tensions, and the erotic yearnings of youth.",
            "An unheralded gem of a motion picture, and one of the more vibrant and authentic depictions of teenage life in memory."

            "Say what you like about the original Rocky, at least it was about something -- a sweet pug up against the system, and in love with a dowd. Rocky IV appears to be an epic about Sylvester Stallone's penchant for self-abuse.",
            "'Rocky IV' still stands, not as a highlight of the series (certainly not that) but as a quintessential artifact of mid-'80s studio filmmaking: soulless, flag-waving, soundtrack-blasting Product. ",
            "Padded with clips from earlier Rocky pictures, adding nothing to his mythic, let alone human dimensions, it lacks even the primitive suspense and crude capacity to release underdog emotions that permitted its predecessors to conquer one's better judgment.",
            "[Stallone] creates credible villains worthy of his heroic character.",
            "This is grim and witless storytelling, and what makes it so depressing is that it hasn't improved by so much as a chemical trace since the days of the first Rocky.",
            "The new film's narrative is stripped down to essentials, which gives it an emblematic quality.",
            "There are simply too many ludicrous elements to ignore: Paulie's robot; Brigitte Nielsen, even less expressive than the robot; about a thousand music-video-styled montages; Lundgren's delivery of Drago's deadly dialogue; etc. ",
            "It's a bad movie, no doubt, but at the same time, and somewhat paradoxically, it's also a great movie. Figure that one out.",
            "It's ridiculous in a lot of ways... But hot d---- is this ever a fun, rewatchable movie.",
            "Dated Cold War-themed boxing sequel has violence. ",
            "The outcome of the film is predetermined by the formulaic scripts of Rocky II and Rocky III. Stallone boxed himself into a corner with this one.",
            "Though it's impossible not to get caught up in our hero's Russian training programme, or to root for his climactic victory, the mawkish montages accompanied by blaring music are no substitute for plot shading.",
            "His vacuous post-bout speech indicates why boxers with 75 professional bouts are rarely called upon as public speakers.",
            "Whatever charm and grit there was in the first film is gone, replaced with a glossed up, over the top form of 1980's action melodrama, which is thick on the cheese and even thicker on the montages. And this critic loved every minute of it.",
            "Sylvester Stallone is really sloughing it off shamelessly in Rocky IV, but it's still impossible not to root for old Rocky Balboa to get up off the canvas and whup that bully one more time.",
            "Ridiculous jingoistic nonsense.",
            "Boxers are noted for their hubris, but Stallone, perhaps still punch-drunk from the early success, would have been better advised to have quit rather than suffer the body blows of this nonsense.",
            "A far cry from the delights (both large and small) of its illustrious original.",
            "The crazed flag-waving would be a lot easier to take if it weren't so clearly a commercial calculation meant to salvage what is otherwise a crass, careless, shamelessly padded film.",
            "...suffers from a vibe of superfluousness...",
            "Film reduced to the barest of three acts.",
            "The film's only major disappointment is a lack of screen-time for a pre-Foofy Foofy Brigitte Nielsen",
            "Predictable and corny. When the Soviet fans as well as the Soviet government officials stand up and cheer Rocky at the end, you can't help but roll your eyes in disbelief."

            "It's good to be back in the saddle again.",

            "I'm just now beginning to realize that, though Mr. Eastwood may have been improving over the years, it's also taken all these years for most of us to recognize his very consistent grace and wit as a filmmaker.",

            "A beautiful, unhurried, snowbound Western punctured by violence and lyricism.",
            "It had been so long since a quality western had hit America's screens that it appears as if Eastwood purposely set out to remind audiences of all the elements that make the genre work.",

            "It's a lightweight, easygoing affair, reminiscent of some of Hawks' or Ford's lesser Westerns.",

            "This infusion of money and production by a major studio gives the film a slightly more polished look, but is inferior to the previous two films in every other way.",
            "If \"Mad Max\" embraced a geneticist's acumen and \"The Road Warrior\" a philosopher's spirit, \"Thunderdome\" is about cold, hard economics - not just in Bartertown's transactions but the market expectations that come with the receipt of studio funding.",

            "Almost every possible mob film has been made, but this one still feels inventive and engaging.",
            "John Huston's dark, cynical comedy about the Mafia, one of his last pictures, suffers from the lack of chemistry between Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner, but Anjelica Huston is excellent in a well-deserving Oscar-winning turn.",
            "A blackly comic and insidiously sly love story in the unforgiving underworld of mob families and freelance criminals...",

            "Widely considered a black comedy classic, Prizzi's Honor is dated today and, tragically, finally revealed as a middling work that wanders aimlessly and ends abruptly.",
            "Yes, it went a little too long, felt a little forced at times, began with one of the most unnecessary lengthy wedding scenes of all-time and ended on a note that simply didn't satisfy, but overall, I enjoyed it and would recommend it.",
            "A black comedy about an ill-fated love affair and the nasty politics of a criminal clan.",
            "As divertidas (e exageradas) performances de Nicholson e Hickey s\u00e3o o ponto alto deste filme apenas regular."

            "Deadly - despite good work from Meg Tilly, the film is grotesquely directed and the spiritual debate is sensationalized beyond all reason.",

            "Fonda's relentless interrogating, mannered chain-smoking and enforced two dimensionality cause her to become tiresome very early on.",

            "Meryl Streep is back in top form. This means that her performance in Out of Africa is at the highest level of acting in film today. Since she is Streep, it means that a return to form is not a return: she has realized a character utterly different.",

            "An intelligent and highly watchable film.",
            "Engagingly played, swoonsomely shot, and a bit breathy... perfect stuff for a Sunday night.",
            "The beauty that people talk about after they have eaten their popcorn and blown their noses is a postcard beauty, and the ache they feel has nothing to do with the script and very little to do with the performances.",
            "Out of Africa is a melodrama, but in any case, it is an excellent one. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "What the movie loses in emotional realism, it gains in sheer epic audacity.",
            "The relationship between Karen Blixen and her British lover, Denys Finch Hatton, may fail to catch fire. But the production itself is so exquisitely served that you can't help but be grateful for this extraordinary visual treat.",
            "Luedtke and Pollack bought these high-priced literary sources only to chuck them for a conventional, largely fictionalized movie romance.",
            "The relationship of Karen and Denys is a prickly and, despite the era in which it is set, curiously modern one. It's also at the heart of this understated movie.",
            "Streep may convince us utterly that she is in love with Africa, but our views of it are a little too stately to really feel the place.",
            "Out of Africa is a splendid example of that persistent genre, the coffeetable movie. It's big, beautiful, and imposing. But there isn't much to it, and pretty pictures -- replacing ideas, not supporting them -- are its only real attraction.",
            "Out of Africa has the sheen of artsiness and the gloss of two big-name actors. Unfortunately, that`s not quite enough in the absence of a story with vigor and passion.",
            "My basic problem with this otherwise sumptuous and well-acted film is that I never was able to accept Redford in character.",
            "Despite its technical assurance and some strong performances, this is a film that favours spectacular landscapes over emotional depth.",
            "Not even the meticulous Meryl can breathe life into a movie that never really gets started, and takes almost an hour to end.",
            "Fantastic acting or not... seven Oscars or not... I was bored. And I can't get past that. ",
            "Out of Africa is, at last, the free-spirited, fullhearted gesture that everyone has been waiting for the movies to make all decade long. It reclaims the emotional territory that is rightfully theirs.",
            "Nominated for 11 Academy Awards, this earned seven, including Best Picture and Best Director ... but no Best Actress, alas."

            "William Friedkin returned to form with this tough, stylish and gutsy crime thriller enhanced by one of the great soundtracks of the 1980s.",
            "To Live and Die in L.A. is undeniably very well made - from the performances to the more technical aspects - but the bottom line is, it's just not all that compelling.",
            "There's not much substance here, but the film ... showcases a grabber of a car chase that compares favorably with the classic one from Friedkin's The French Connection."

            "A classic play has been reduced a decent movie. It's a shame it couldn't be as good as the play; it's a small pleasure that it`s as entertaining as it is.",

            "A Chorus Line is a noble, at times highly entertaining attempt to bring a hopelessly stagebound show to film. Considering the limitations of the medium, it's almost as good as it could be.",
            "The show's format proves too slippery for the director to manage properly. The stagebound setting gets boring; the action doesn't build a steady momentum; and the characters do far too much hanging around until the camera's ready to point at them again.",
            "Attenborough's efficient workmanlike adaptation of the hugely popular Broadway musical works surprisingly well transferred to the big screen.",
            "This $24 million extravaganza is an empty shell, so cautious it lacks even the sleazy energy of a real desecration.",
            "Athough director Attenborough's film version has a couple of pleasant numbers which serve as oases amidst the dullness, it really hurts for those who remember the dazzle and emotional depth of the let's-put-on-a-show original.",
            "Attenborough takes the show that set the stage alight and, in this curiously flat version, dampens its spirit.",
            "Attenborough hasn't solved all of the problems; claustrophobia sometimes creeps into the proceedings But he keeps the performances alive and the camera moving, and he has brought a stagy musical to glowing life.",
            "Since this is effectively a record of one of the greatest works of musical theatre, there is much of merit, especially Alyson Reed... and ex-Dallas regular Audrey Landers.",
            "probably worked much better as a live production",
            "'A Chorus Line' will certainly give people who think they want a career in dance some idea of whether they're up to the challenge. And the rest of the audience will never look at a musical chorus line the same way.",
            "Misconceived and poorly executed by director Richard (Gandhi) Attenborough, who turns the Broadway smash hit musical into a total bore.",

            "If all they did was get it on film, that's not so bad.",

            "Mr. Attenborough is listed as the director of 'A Chorus Line,' but what he seems actually to have done is to act as the escort to the screen of a reasonable facsimile of the show, not noticing that it was dying en route."

            "Brooks, who wrote the script with Monica Johnson, is a highly original comedic spirit.",
            "Too often, things are simply too painfully accurate to be particularly funny. Still, it's hard to fault Brooks' resolutely adult intelligence, and Lost in America - almost in spite of itself, really - is easily his most consistently amusing work to date.",
            "It's an endlessly funny and often uncomfortable piece of work, featuring some of the sharpest, deftest writing Brooks and frequent collaborator Monica Johnson ever crafted. ",
            "An amusingly bumpy ride.",
            "Lost in America is being called a yuppie comedy, but it's really about the much more universal subjects of greed, hedonism and panic. What makes it so funny is how much we can identify with it. ",
            "Brooks' Lost in America is a well-directed and effortlessly entertaining satire of the Reagan era.",
            "Even when sizable blunders burst into unimaginable proportions, it's difficult to be mad at these personas; they're funny when they bicker and charming when they reconnect.",
            "With co-writer Monica Johnson, his collaborator on Real Life and Modern Romance, Brooks has scripted the perfect outing for his gifts.",
            "Packed to the gills with Albert Brooks' signature dialog, and played to the hilt by both leads, Lost in America has a long set-up. But it's a testament to Brook's clever characterization.",
            "Brooks explodes the Kerouac fantasy by depicting two of the most uptight, urban people in the world trying to live it out. ",
            "Lost in America is one of the funniest films from one of our greatest cinematic comedians.",
            "Amusing satire on yuppies having a mid-life crisis.",
            "It is, I think, Brooks' masterpiece -- nothing inessential, one great scene after another, just flat-out perfect. Stanley Kubrick was an Albert Brooks fan for a reason.",
            "A complete joy from start to finish! See it before you take to the wide-open road!",
            "This sharply observed satire about disillusioned yuppies is Brooks' chef d'oeuvre and first commercial success, a film with an hero that's less obnoxious than the usual and a wonderful partner too, played by Julie Hagerty",
            "One Albert Brooks' best, laughs throughout.",
            "New Yorkers have Woody Allen. Middle America has Albert Brooks.",
            "Depends on your Albert Brooks' tolerance. Mine is low."
