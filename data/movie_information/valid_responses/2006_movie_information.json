            "The new plot has all the appeal of a seaweed sandwich, being dark, salty, and indigestible.",
            "Lumpen direction, lousy writing and pouting performances aside, the worst thing about Dead Man's Chest is its interminable length.",
            "It ought to sink from the weight of the cargo, but it's buoyed by another high-wire performance from Depp.",
            "This second film is pretty much all thrills, special effects and nonstop action -- but with virtually no cohesive or compelling story line.",
            "'Complications arose, ensued, were overcome,' Jack says at one point. Not entirely, but Dead Man's Chest is worth weighing anchor for, regardless.",
            "Although the previous film ended rather resolutely, there's no denying that the further tales of Jack Sparrow are significantly suitable affairs for cinematic realization.",

            "Awkward but graceful, derivative but daring, Happy Feet is, indeed, a flightless bird in the best and worst sense.",
            "Offers a sucrose-enriched upgrade to the documentary March of the Penguins.",
            "Director George 'Babe' Miller has pulled off a coup with this one; he's raised the benchmark to a whole new level, both visually and conceptually. Bravo.",
            "It's going to take some time before I can look at the snowy breast of a penguin without imagining that it contains the tap-tapping heart of a Sammy Davis Jr.",

            "A surefire Oscar contender, come on and join the fun! All singing! All dancing! All penguins! Come 'on and get happy! ",

            "Parables about xenophobia, tolerance, religion and ecological responsibility are played to cuddly conclusions. Balletic underwater sequences and a jukebox-musical soundtrack spanning Chicago to Grandmaster Flash are spoonfuls of sugar for the medicine.",
            "George Miller's jubilant, eccentric film makes its CGI penguins vibrant, expressive, even cosmic",
            "The perfect film for audiences who found fault with March of the Penguins because it was too emotionally taxing and you couldn't dance to it.",

            "That's the wonder of the film: it's about the vicious power of loneliness, played out through a story of two women in love. The tragedy, for both of them, is that it's not with each other.",
            "Blanchett has also recently appeared in The Good German and Babel, but this represents far and away her best work.",
            "Richard Eyre directs the film like a chamber play. He leans on Philip Glass's ever-present and insistent music like a crutch. But his natural gift for framing scenes is terrifically assured. A potent and evil pleasure.",
            "Notes on a Scandal is about something deeply unlovely in human nature rarely explored by poets, or novelists, or film-makers: the explosive combination of desire and social envy.",
            "Richard Eyre's direction merely plays up the melodramatic aspects of Zo\u00eb Heller's novel, screenwriter Patrick Marber's acidic dialogue occasionally slips into the overwritten, and the rest of the cast gamely chews table scraps.",
            "Dench is compelling, and offers a transcendent portrait of a sociopath, whose bitter, fantasy-inflected interaction with the outside world is informed by a colossal solipsism.",
            "A sharp, intelligent thriller whose thrills come not from car chases or shootouts - but from the power of words; glorious, unabashedly brutal words.",
            "The strength of the writing, and therefore the directing, is that it sees the scandal as a minor point in a human experience that is naturally corrupt, and cares more about how those on the inside choose to deal with their realities.",
            "Stages the story with a tastefulness both ponderous and dishonest",
            "British cinema fans shouldn't miss this one.",
            "Eyre paces it with an eye for the telling detail, and Blanchett and Dench give harrowing, fearless performances.",
            "Notes on a Scandal is melodrama at its best -- a nasty, wickedly good, over-the-top story with school teachers standing in where vampires usually prowl.",
            "born from watching too many episodes of Jerry Springer, and the filmmakers decided it would be more accepted by the Academy if the characters had British accents.",
            "The characters' motives are base enough, and there's an odd combination of petty incidents having walloping consequences, but the ironies are as delicately layered and \"delicious\" as they could possibly be without a hint of preciosity.",
            "Dench's performance is the greatest pleasure in a hugely enjoyable, highly literate drama.",
            "...a thoroughly trashy piece of work...",
            "Em seus melhores momentos, \u00e9 um drama relativamente eficaz. (...) Nos piores, parece uma vers\u00e3o de O Pentelho protagonizada por mulheres e com Judi Dench no lugar de Jim Carrey.",
            "Un brillante duelo actoral entre Judi Dench y Cate Blanchett %u2013dos de las mejores actrices de la actualidad- que es tambi\u00e9n un sutil estudio sobre la soledad y la obsesi\u00f3n.",
            "As much as Barbara judges, however, you may find yourself in a quandary, not judging so much as taking pleasure in her vile, brilliant perfection.",
            "The movie's driving force is Dench, whose extraordinary performance only underscores her post as one of the world's finest living actresses.",
            "A measured and yet gloriously overblown study of desire, entitlement and the twists we experience while shuttling between the two.",
            "Without a clear protagonist, \"Notes On a Scandal\" collapses under the weight of its significant subject matter. Nevertheless, Cate Blanchett and Judi Dench rise above the ill- prepared source material with their passionate performances. "

            "One of those films that commits few egregious errors, but scales few real heights. There is nothing either terribly wrong or keenly right about it. It's tidy, I suppose.",
            "If the source material is soft, the film then takes another punch with the casting of Ren\u00e9e Zellweger in the title role. She overflows with tics and twitches that make the author seem vaguely deranged.",
            "With Miss Potter, Renee Zellweger has won back that precious thing that stardom rips away and the tabloids won't let you reclaim: her charm.",
            "Unbearably, the script accommodates a quaking courtship between the slightly dotty Potter and her devoted young publisher, ho exchange romantic byplay such as, \"You and rabbits -- extraordinary!\" and \"I recently remembered a story...about a duck!\"",
            "A grave disappointment.",
            "Always accessible in a Downton-Abbey-goes-to-Play-School kind of way, as evidenced by Ren\u00e9e Zellweger's chipper portrayal of Potter as a bustle-skirted bundle of squinty smiles and sudden blushes.",
            "Miss Potter -- as charming and enchanting as her beloved Tales of Peter Rabbit.",
            "Impersonating her, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger is willing to be plain, and she lets a gleam in her eye and the hamsterish clenching of her cheeks hint at Potter's formidable strength of will.",
            "Miss Potter is too well crafted to actually be bad, but it's too light to be better than good. An entertaining trifle, but a trifle nonetheless.",

            "While it cannot sustain the fairytale enchantment of something like Finding Neverland, Miss Potter is, nonetheless, a worthy and sweet, middle-of-the-road biopic.",
            "There's nothing inherently wrong with MISS POTTER. It's just a throwback to the biopics of the 1930s and 40s and in some ways it may seem progressive to contemporary audiences.",
            " Much like star Ren\u00e9e Zellweger's portrayal of its famous title character, Miss Potter is a strange, split-personality kind of thing.",
            "Portraying a real-life hero can be a tough assignment. But Zellweger breezes through the role, flashing her puckish grin, talking in her soft, breathy voice and giving very human face to one of the most beloved figures of English letters.",
            "For fans of Potter's work, \"Miss Potter\" is indispensable. But even viewers with the haziest memories of those unique little books will enjoy spending 90 minutes inside her idyllic world.",
            "Director Chris Noonan ('Babe') gives us a story with the right balance of humor, pathos and romance.",

            "Gently paced and delicately played, give this long enough and it becomes a compelling watch that eventually rewards any moral aspirations with a splendid Zatoichi-style scrap that manages to stay its welcome.",
            "The third in director Yoji Yamada's Samurai Trilogy is an enjoyable, well acted drama, with a superb climactic swordfight and a plot that seems to have been lifted straight out of Hollywood melodrama.",

            "Might work as a short story but as a full-length makes for a long, slow round of watch-checking."

            "Paul Verhoeven's WWII drama stars the lovely Dutch actress Carice van Houten as a Jewish Resistance worker, and costars her breasts. All three deserve awards consideration.",
            "The happy ending demands that [Verhoeven's] return-journey film -- Black Book -- be a rousing artistic triumph. It isn't. Too many of his lazy Hollywood habits have followed him home.",
            "Insanely entertaining -- and often just plain insane -- World War II melodrama. You may hate yourself in the morning, but you'll have to admit Verhoeven gives you a lot of bang for your buck.",
            "Black Book doesn't let the grim facts of the Holocaust get in the way of some ripping pulp.",
            "Carice van Houten is a particularly strong lead, sucking the audience into her morbid world of perpetual torture and misfortune.",
            "The film manages to turn German occupied Holland circa 1944 into a fast-paced thrill ride without sacrificing the emotional core and very real human toll.",
            "... [Director Paul Verhoeven] revels in cinema's powers of deception, to conceal and then reveal reality, to cover subversive ideas inside the armour of genre.",
            "Seven years after he disappeared with the whimper that was Hollow Man, Paul Verhoeven has returned with what may be his best film.",
            "The handsomely mounted, heedlessly pulpy modernist World War II thriller that \"The Good German\" and \"Valkyrie\" failed to be - a dizzying rush of daring rescues, sexual intrigue, treachery, betrayal, gunfights, hasty conclusions and harrowing consequences.",
            "It's the last thing a Verhoeven film should be: tasteful",
            "A slick, thrilling, trashy, melodramatic and serialesque soap opera adventure which conceals the complex tale of moral ambiguity beneath.",
            "While gleefully turning all prior war movie stereotypes on their heads, Verhoeven opts for the bizarre theory that ravishing designing women and lots of sex can change the course of world history.",
            "There are a lot of plot twists at the end of the film, maybe too many, but it will keep you guessing.",
            "Verhoeven simplesmente mant\u00e9m sua obsess\u00e3o habitual com sexo e viol\u00eancia (geralmente combinando os dois), mas sem qualquer sofistica\u00e7\u00e3o narrativa ou visual.",
            "It's engaging as an espionage thriller and as a story of courage and determination.",

            "...for the uninitiated, the story meanders far too much to resonate, and Altman's relentless focus on mortality dampens the show's amiable charm.",
            "It looks and feels like an Altman film, but one made completely on a pointless lark.",
            "Life is fleeting, but A Prairie Home Companion, slender and perfect, proves that art endures as a reminder of it",

            "The movie is a shaggy-dog trifle, but it's a sweet and lovely one.",
            "Altman's star-studded cast is natural and energetic -- with the exception of a surprisingly detached Keillor -- and the Hollywood folks mingle easily, in character, among the real show's performers, a technique Altman perfected in Nashville.",
            "...a lovely and bittersweet fable about morality, the fleetingness of fame, drawing strength from the past and finding the inevitable beauty in the darkest of situations.",
            "In its neatest trick of all, the script circumvents any criticism of its lack of timeliness by very literally casting the proceedings under a shadow of death.",
            "Alternatively wistful and satirical, Prairie isn't an Altman classic, but it's a fine time.",
            "This adaptation is highly-recommended for loyal devotees of the long-running radio show as a cinematic capstone on Keillor's magnificent career.",
            "La despedida de Robert Altman no est\u00e1 entre lo mejor de su obra, pero es una c\u00e1lida evocaci\u00f3n de tiempos y ritos pasados animada por un atractivo elenco.",
            "[Altman's] trademark techniques...lend themselves perfectly to the setting, but his ability to coax remarkable performances from an array of actors has rarely served him better.",

            "Don't be offended, none of this really means anything, it's just a goof about a lot of dumb stuff going down around us.",
            "The film takes on more than it knows how to handle, and what starts out as a standard poke-in-the-eye of TV switches its satiric focus to the incompetence of terrorists and politicians, the heartlessness of celebs, and even the mess of Iraq.",
            "Begins really quite well, but ends with three zeds, not one.",
            "The director of American Pie has set out to make a merciless satire of American media culture along the lines of Network, but his ideas are so commonplace that nothing registers except the bile.",
            "Promising more bite than it delivers, Dreamz is pitched too broadly to get very deeply under your skin. Still, there are some smarts at work here, and it will make you laugh.",
            "American Dreamz is mostly pretty feeble stuff.",
            "An all-over-the-map satire of American Idol where there are enough positives to outweigh the negatives.",
            "They wanted to cover too many things, and in some cases they have stayed halfway. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "Too broad and obvious to rate as satire, the film is finally neither focused nor acidic enough to say anything meaningful about the sorry state of the US.",
            "Still, it is gratifying to come across a mainstream film that seems happy to risk offending so many different groups. And, best of all, Weitz bravely declines to chicken out and give us a cosy ending.",
            "Truth is, American Dreamz could have used a bracing dose of Simon Cowell's cruel, sharp-tongued venom.",
            "Both delights and contrivances combine to provide a bombshell final reel that is at least a dozen shades darker than anyone would expect.",
            "Based on the material reality gave the writers of this film to work with, it should've been f---ing hilarious, right? Not so much.",
            "Ultimately, this satire is just as shallow as the celebrity-obsessed culture it seeks to lampoon.",
            "The overriding problem here is that Weitz doesn't have much to say about his subject, other than that television, politics and terrorism are all part of show business.",
            "Still, if American Dreamz doesn't quite come together, it's more rewarding than lots of films that do. Like an episode of The Simpsons directed by Robert Altman, it's a smart, cynical sprawl.",
            "American Dreamz has funny and dark moments, but unfortunately not enough of either.",
            "[Director Paul Weitz] daringly explores various kinds of nihilism, comparing the self-obliterating nature of both extremism and fame.",
            "American Dreamz tries hard to be both important and farcical, but it leans a bit too much towards farce without being funny enough to pull that off either. It's decent, but uninspired.",
            "The pieces are all in place for a slashing Preston Sturges jamboree. All that's missing are balls",
            "Weitz and crew almost create a \"Satire for Dummies\" film, featuring gags and social commentary that are neither funny, nor edgy...",
            "American Dreamz takes some good shots, develops some inspired absurdity, and takes on more targets than it knows what to do with.",
            "Writer/Director Paul Wietz (\"In Good Company\") tries his hand at creating a topical satire of our current American social-political crisis and comes up far short of capturing the brutal climate of a country running on the fumes of its dismembered civil ri",
            "Did writer-director Paul Weitz think that U.S. audiences would be too dumb to appreciate actual satire?"

            "Well-acted and meticulously crafted, Little Children can feel less like a full-blooded representation of life than a disquieting literary exercise.",

            "As in Field's first film, the characters are drawn with such compassion their follies become our own and their desires seem as vast as the night sky.",
            "Little Children includes all the clich\u00e9d scenarios of a midday TV sudser, but they're ratcheted up several seedy degrees.",
            "Little Children shines through its flaws to deliver some of this season's most adult entertainment, a chilly send-up of an America we can all see out our windows or through our video screens.",
            "Little Children is a superb adaptation, which is, nevertheless, slightly let down by too much exposition that comes from a desire to give too many characters meaningful time on screen.",
            "That a movie can inspire smirks in the same scene where a potential predator is seen scuba diving in the community swimming pool underneath hundreds of young children is one of the most notable feats of any modern motion picture.",
            "Playing up her sturdiness, her furry dark brows and the wiry unruliness of her old-gold hair, Winslet is the best Emma Bovary I've seen-even if she's named Sarah, not Emma. ",
            "More than just another dissection of suburban sexual frustration, its concern with children, parents and those of us who lie somewhere in-between make Little Children a minor masterpiece.",
            "It's not necessarily a cautionary tale, but more a look within a surface utopia that doesn't really exist.",
            "As commentary on our time, it may be accurate. As movie drama, it isn't so much overheated as reheated in the microwave on high.",
            "Its antiseptic textures merely whimper 'Oscar clip'",
            "Bereft of a protagonist, the movie breaks down under the weight of absurd voice-over narration and an exploitative ending that is as indefensibly wrongheaded as it is cheap.",
            "Blame Field (remember, Perrotta also wrote the knifelike Election), for facing the material too squarely.",
            "A risky and rewarding art film, but definitely for grown-ups.",

            "A funny thing happened to The History Boys on the way to the screen. The players are the same, the dialogue is pretty much identical, but the vibrancy of the play -- its exhilarating immediacy -- has been muted.",
            "The film becomes a sermonette on tolerance. But with its one-sidedness, it fails to practice what it preaches.",
            "The History Boys is a movie that asks questions like 'What is education really for anyway?' and asks them in an altogether witty, brainy way. It turns history into what it really is, the story of our lives.",
            "Full of energy, ideas and fine acting.",
            "The History Boys boasts a dazzling verbal cleverness%u2014the gleeful rat-a-tat of snappy banter expertly executed%u2014that doesn't keep it from also being deeply, exquisitely sad.",
            "The play's the thing -- the only thing -- here",
            "In attempting to absolve the perverse actions of a teacher on the basis of his apparent tutoring skills, Alan Bennett has created a dubious work of fiction that is beyond empathy or humor.",
            "The History Boys is much less about lighting and composition than it is about Bennett's sharp, insightful script.",
            "The transfer from stage to film doesn't always go smoothly, as it's hard to shake the film's theater roots.",
            "Movies, unlike plays, tend to be just about a very few things, or they feel rushed and overly sweeping, as this one occasionally did. Plays can linger and chew on their themes and keep the audience engaged much more easily.",
            "With the writing way above board and insights fueling the story forward with heart and bawdy comedy, \"The History Boys\" is amiably off-center, sure, but it finds its core and leaves its mark.",
            "A hugely enjoyable outing of subtle humour, witty words and a keen insight into human nature and the art of learning.",
            "[History Boys] is most potently about the love of teaching, and how the best teachers can help give meaning to existence; and if not meaning in the grand sense, at least an appreciation of what it means to be human.",
            "What lifts this film above the average is the extremely clever, erudite and witty dialogue.",
            ".. gentle and sweet, ..all the more charming for its faith in its presumptive audience. It's heartening to come across a popular entertainment ...not pitched at the dull normal demographic.",
            "refreshing--a film that doesn't insult the audience's intelligence",
            "I was sad when school let out. The characters are so rich I wanted to spend more time with them.",
            "It's too bad that the film loses its way because The History Boys asks some interesting questions about what to learn and how to use it.",
            "If you like your British movies quick, raunchy, reflective, and bittersweet, then The History Boys is for you."

            "Though Binoche does very solid work, she can't sell the idea of her and Law as a couple; the chemistry isn't there. Not much else rings true in Minghella's screenplay, which is full of coincidences and speeches about race and class.",
            "Despite its arty construction and clever dialogue, Breaking and Entering leaves us too chilly to care.",
            "Breaking and Entering offers a kinder, gentler version of London's strife than we're accustomed to seeing. Not all parts of the script are equally well-developed, and sometimes it seems as if we're looking at drama under glass.",
            "As with all of Minghella's films, there's intelligence and texture and depth and feeling, though here the emotions can seem frostbitten. Perhaps the first thing that wasn't working and needed to be fully broken to heal was the script.",
            "Maybe Jude Law should take some time off from acting. Maybe Juliette Binoche should get a new dialect coach. Maybe Anthony Minghella should try writing a movie ending that doesn't make everybody groan.",
            "Breaking and Entering is Anthony Minghella's provocative romantic thriller dedicated to the proposition that the truest love is mostly likely a crime of some sort, even if the criminals are never caught out.",
            "Minghella takes Haneke's gravitas and transforms it into the brand of sorrowful yuppie chow and shallow treatment of alienation favored by angsty Hollywood melodramas such as Crash.",
            "Polite and detached, the story waggles and waffles from start to finish, never bringing the emotional and societal complexities to fruition. BREAKING AND ENTERING should be \"Breaking and Exiting.\" Break out of your seat and run to the nearest exit.",
            "One-hundred percent uncut bourgeois fantasy",
            "Though intricately plotted and well acted, Minghella's characters feel more like symbols than flesh-and-blood characters, and their travails seem designed to illustrate a lecture about privilege, injustice, cultural stereotypes and bourgeois complacency.",
            "Insightful, contemporary love story for adults.",
            "A convoluted plot of break-ins, architectural redevelopment and mid-30s life crises mask a fairly standard tale of a love triangle.",
            "Everything in Anthony Minghella's Breaking and Entering is torn and in need of mending....And like the flaw's set within the confines of the film, the movie itself is in need of a little tinkering itself.",

            "A messy yet occasionally affecting drama.",
            "Un drama urbano muy contempor\u00e1neo que explora superficialmente ciertas realidades sociales, pero que presta m\u00e1s atenci\u00f3n a las crisis dom\u00e9sticas de sus personajes. Podr\u00eda haber sido mucho m\u00e1s interesante.",
            "Minghella signe une %u0153uvre enivrante \u00e9num\u00e9rant avec tact et intelligence les valeurs d'honn\u00eatet\u00e9, de respect et de confiance d\u00e9coulant de chacune de ses r\u00e9solutions de conflit.",
            "Class friction and the ensuing cinema of paranoia evidence of the growing class divide on screen",
            "...a handsome but regrettably underpowered and preachy movie about liberal white guilt.",
            "When Vera Farmiga shows up as a ridiculous Romanian prostitute, we want to give her money just so she'll remain onscreen and continue to flash her chest and her phony accent and offer at least the promise of titillation.",
            " A story of thievery and a torrid love affair, it takes a capable filmmaker and a skilled cast and locks them up in a holding cell of pretense."

            "I saw this at a festival and hated it, then sat through it again a year later and decided it wasn't so bad, aside from the god-awful ending.",
            "It's a pity, because few romcoms pull off the basically sympathetic mining of personal vanities and social embarrassment that the film manages in its opening hour.",
            "David Duchonvy and Julianne Moore make an engaging double-act and an undercurrent of droll humour keeps things zipping along quite amiably for the most part.",
            "Freundlich's outstanding cast (including Garry Shandling, Eva Mendes, Ellen Barkin, Bob Balaban and James LeGros) -- his best since 1997's The Myth of Fingerprints -- glosses over miscalculations with sheer star power.",
            "Two couples in trouble, one with kids, another considering them. Writer-director Bart Freundlich's challenge is to stress them and find a resolution to their conflicts in ways that aren't banal, predictable or witless. And he settles for one out of three.",
            "The fact that Freundlich tries to put some thoughtful commentary into a formulaic story is commendable, but in the end either his faith wavers or the studio intervened.",
            "Trust me on this one. This is one time you can Trust The Man",
            "\"Trust The Man\" is an agreeable New York-centric romantic comedy about two couples on the brink of self-destructing.",
            "Really when you cut through all the garbage, Bart Freundlich presents us with an illusion of originality...",
            "This rickety empty-feeling production has a script & stars that deliver lots of edgy little subtle jokes. The dialogue is crisp and crunchy, but the romance is nearly absent.",
            "An intelligent low-brow comedy for adults.",
            "There's no feeling of weight or consequence in a movie so shapeless it has not one but two musical montage sequences...and a \"one month later\" card.",
            "Over the next ninety minutes or so we are treated to a series of scenes that, while often funny, seem to exist because the cast was in the same room together.",
            "Freundlich is a pretentious film-school brat who seems obsessed with making botched retreads of the kinds of thesis pictures that people in film school like to pontificate about.",
            "It's winter in New York and two couples symbolically battle rain, wind and snow as their relationships skid on thin ice. There are some funny lines, novel situations and for the most part, the film is amusing, even though some of the laughs are contrived",
            "Freundlich's intelligent, very funny take on male-female relationships manages the not inconsiderable feat of being both jaded and appealingly fresh.",
            "Trust the Man has its moments but it's ultimately disappointing, despite strong performances from its excellent cast.",
            "A relationship dramedy wields little power without an emotional punch. And when the theatrical (literally) climax attempts bold emotionality, one can't help but wince.",
            "The finale is a screwball sequence so out of step with what comes before that it feels like part of another (but not necessarily better) movie.",
            "The fault for this flaccid comedy lies not in Freundlich's stars, but in the way he portrays his men and women as biologically-driven boobs.",
            "Almost a good movie by Freundlich, in fact, his best yet. Keep making 'em.",
            "[Has] an abundance of charm and wisdom and heart, thanks to the appealing cast and smart script..."

            "Harsh Times is an hour-by-hour diary of two crazy, unreliable, irresponsible dudes trying to find a way to fit into the same society they hate, facing one hurdle after another until they appear to butcher half of Los Angeles.",
            "Jim is such a psycho and Mike is such a patsy, we don't care about these guys. We've seen dozens of more interesting head cases in dozens of smarter films.",
            "Harsh Times is so into its own nihilism, it sometimes forgets the humanity beneath the hurt.",
            "Endless scenes of the two guys riding along, venting and cursing and chugging beers play like acting-class exercises, badly written ones at that.",
            "Ayer makes his directing debut with Harsh Times, which is so relentlessly grim that it occasionally goes over the top and invites derision.",
            "For a neophyte director, Ayer displays a lot of style.",
            "A crazy little film, modest in its scope but grand in its ambition. It paints it's story in loud primary colors, with intense pressure cooker characterizations.",
            "HARSH TIMES is a portrait of a male-dominated world and inChristian Bale's fierce performance, Ayer has found the perfect actor. It's just unfortunate that the screenplay feels like a left-over from an era that has passed.",
            "just like its protagonist, Harsh Times is fatally flawed, but in a manner that still remains compelling to watch.",
            "A movie that seems gritty and pointless for its first third, begins to grow in meaning as the pointlessness snowballs into absurdity and then tragedy.",
            "It's an amazing performance, one of the best of the year, with Bale truly making you believe in this over-the-top character.",
            "Por alguns instantes, o filme parece ter algo relevante a dizer sobre a desumaniza\u00e7\u00e3o provocada pela guerra ou o niilismo de uma gera\u00e7\u00e3o entediada e descrente, mas constatamos que quer apenas chocar, desperdi\u00e7ando as \u00f3timas atua\u00e7\u00f5es de Bale e Rodriguez.",
            "A gritty, automobile-intensive, buddy flick rather reminiscent of director David Ayer's similarly amoral Training Day.",
            "Harsh Times is dark and brutal, not the kind of film that lures a large audience or garners awards, although it deserves both.",
            "The mix of black humor and pitiless drama makes for a very effective cinematic slow burn",
            "Harsh Times wins in the end by keeping its fingers wrapped tightly around its viewers' throats.",
            "Jim Davis (Christian Bale) may be the most aggressively self-destructive character since Johnny Boy Civello in 'Mean Streets.'",
            " None of these characters are the least bit likeable, and that's the fault of David Ayer, who structures the film as a series of mostly disconnected episodes with a single theme:",
            "Ayer has a feel for the grimy underside of urban life...",
            "We don't like the view from this dark place, but is that a flaw or precisely the point?",
            "Bale's wild-eyed menace keeps you watching for a time, but by the grisly end he's just another American psycho."

            "Catch a Fire is confident enough to depict the battle from all sides.",

            "It doesn't quite have the adrenaline to be a great thriller, but Catch a Fire makes up for it with compelling characters and a genuinely important theme, skillfully told. There's not much else you can ask from a film than that.",

            "Revolutionary struggle in a film uniquely focused on an ordinary but remarkable man.",
            "An intelligent thriller that effectively conveys the message that terrorism, even in apartheid-era South Africa, is rarely a black-and-white issue.",
            "Noyce's blockbuster tour of duty has equipped him with the skills to bring some of the 20th century's most resonant stories to the masses, dressed in the lean gloss of satisfying thrillers.",
            "What biopics and issue-driven films could be if they had the guts to go beyond the easy answers.",
            "Actually serves as little else but agitprop for South Africa's ruling party . . .",

            "Ryan Gosling's self-destructive teacher is easily the year's most mesmerizing character study. And he's hardly the only reason to see this film. Shareeka Epps anchors her scenes as Drey with a self-possession way beyond her years.",
            "It's hardly a film which trumpets its virtues but that's part of the pleasure to be had from it. It doesn't know how good it is.",
            "It's impressively adult, sure-footed filmmaking, and that Best Actor nod was definitely deserved.",
            "Dunne [Gosling] is an enjoyable and impressive creation, justifiably recognised with an Oscar nomination for Gosling earlier this year.",
            "It's the gritty script and sheer quality of the performances that distinguish this parable.",
            "It takes a while to settle into the rhythm (feeling episodic at first), but Half Nelson soon takes hold with a vice-like grip.",
            "High ideals clash with Bush-era realities in this class debut - well balanced, wonderfully performed, and refreshingly free from clich\u00e9.",
            "The more interesting aspects of the film come in its less pre-determined margins. And maybe the drama is highly strategised, but the acting is real and genuine.",
            "A fantastic merging of talents into a pure piece of art...",
            "Indie inner-city drama with drug-addict teacher.",
            "\"Half Nelson\" elegantly tiptoe around its elephant in the room: Dan's most compelling instruction to not let Drey enter the drug trade is his own destruction. That point of panic turns into something approaching penance.",
            "The filmmakers bask disingenuously in their tidy vision of border-busting healing",
            "A sometimes subtle, sometimes bombastic (Gosling's performance ranges from brilliant to bug-eyed) parable about class, race, power, and the dialectics of family relationships.",
            "The movie hits a stream of false notes when Dunne's students deliver oral reports on Civil Rights struggles that could only have been plagiarized. The film's ending isn't only meager, it's utterly listless.",
            "Gosling is up for an Oscar (R) for his work in Half Nelson, and there's no question he earned the nomination.",
            "Half Nelson trades melodrama for authenticity, cliche heroics for genuine heart, cheap cinematic parlor tricks for blessed restraint.",
            "This is a brave, smart and sensitive film.",
            "We've gotten so close to these characters (and they to each other) that we don't want to let them go.",
            "It is, in fact, a fine piece of work: reticent, intelligent, wholly devoid of triumphalism or self-pity.",
            "While the students first mock Marxist dialectics and notions of oppression applied to the everyday, they are eventually eagerly embracing the rebellious spirit of Attica and Allende in class presentations that provide euphoric momentum.",
            "Looks to me like a self conscious film that thrives on its own negativity. Studied, anti-establishment, arthouse cinema that gloats over its moral superiority %u2013 which is rather ironic.",
            "It's a thoughtful character study with Gosling simply tremendous as the functioning addict, who seems to use crack to anaesthetise him from his inability to form adult relationships.",
            "A riveting study in dislocation and connection, hurt and healing, with Gosling revealed as potentially the most gifted actor of his generation."

            "Good intentions and strong thespians aside, Seidelman's writing and filmmaking are bland, obvious and uninvolving.",
            "The characters are treated with respect, and their zest for life is inspiring (and not just for those who share their age bracket).",

            "The movie is funny without disrespecting its characters. But there is a sadness at its heart, because, although the possibilities for romantic happiness diminish after the age of 65, the dynamics of sexual attraction and coupling never change.",
            "Seidelman's movie doesn't dig deep, and the comedy too quickly veers into routine relationship territory -- albeit with wrinkles.",
            "Not a very good movie, but it somehow manages to be enjoyable.",
            "This funny, nervy, and pointedly unrated geriatric sex comedy is both enhanced and occasionally limited by being targeted at baby boomers.",

            "This somber action picture bravely defies expectations and gives us something wholly new.",
            "The writer-director Michael Mann can have you believe almost anything... Miami Vice is rife with implausibilities yet so firmly rooted in what looks and sounds like reality that suspension of disbelief is almost mandatory -- at least for a while.",
            "Mann is the master of nighttime digital photography, and he fills the screen with stunning images and some intricately choreographed shoot-out scenes that I just loved.",
            "Foxx and Farrell seem slightly out of place both as undercover drug runners and as police officers.",

            "Miami Vice may be entertaining, but it's far from perfect.",
            "The film will have Mann fans applauding his decision to axe the pastels and neon of the TV series for a harder attitude and updated style, though others may not be so forgiving of the unintelligible dialogue and lack of ending.",
            "You come away with your head full of images, and ready to go back for more.",
            "So solemn and straight-faced is this violent expansion of the old show, under the precise, glossy and macho directing hand of the series' creator Michael Mann, that it skirts awfully close at times to unintentional self-parody.",
            "Mann does deserve credit for wanting to do something new with the material. It's just too bad he spent so much time making changes in costuming, art direction, soundtrack and character, only to turn around and tell the same old story.",
            "Here, both stars are flat, hampered by cheesy dialogue, dark sunglasses and a by-the-book drama that gives them little to do. When in doubt, they simply look mean and bored.",

            "Unlike the TV series, Miami Vice takes itself too seriously to be trashy -- and too seriously to be much fun either.",
            "It helps that everything is delivered with Mann's usual attention to visual style. As in his previous film, Collateral, digital shooting superbly captures the feel of a hot American city at night.",

            "The ending isn't exactly happily-ever-after, but it leaves you with a deep-down respect and affection for this determined little tyke who perseveres against all odds.",
            "With a tensed brow, Kolya Spiridonov plays a boy perpetually hovering between anxiety and dogged determination, and the film walks the same line, unsure about where it's going but always moving forward regardless.",
            "Vividly characterised and convincingly acted (not least by Spiridonov), it makes for a fascinating portrait of a post-Communist society beset by crime and despair.",
            "A stunningly powerful indictment of the weakest in thrall to a corrupt system.",
            "An unsentimental and vividly characterized film which successfully combines melodrama and social analysis and features an impressive central performance from Spiridonov.",
            "Despite channeling Dickensian melodrama, first-time director Andrei Kravchuk skilfully avoids wallowing in sentimentality.",
            "It's a touching film about a little boy with the determination of a champ.",
            "It is hard-hitting, but with none of the fake, over-the-top violence of Hollywood fare, and packs an emotional punch without dredging it with sugar.",
            "What really makes this potentially melodramatic story so powerful is the incredibly intense and focused presence of little Kolya Spiridonov, who makes you believe Vanya's determination and grit every step of the way.",
            "Like Vittorio De Sica, one of the great Italian neo-realists, Kravchuk populates his film with people, not paradigms; his characters are capable of good and evil, sometimes in equal measure.",
            "It is about love, family, and the power of kindness to overcome the cruelty in the world.",
            "There are shocking and heartbreaking moments scattered throughout The Italian, but [director] Kravchuk approaches them with a nonjudgmental, observational style that avoids most of the pitfalls of melodrama.",
            "A throwback to neo-realist filmmaking . . . snowballs in emotion until later scenes are stomach-knotting in their tension. The film largely avoids sentiment with its muted score and shadowed close-ups.",
            "An odd, beguiling little movie -- about two parts Dickens (with some Dickensian Chaplin thrown in) to one part Italian neorealist cinema.",
            "With a riveting performance by young Kolya Spiridonov as the six year old Vanya, The Italian is a bitter sweet drama that captures the heartbreaking squalor of Russian orphans while highlighting the power of the spirit.",
            "Cinematographer Aleksandr Burov captures a land of frost-coated fields, cracked plaster walls and weed-choked railways with a photojournalist's eye for the telling detail.",
            "From Russia with harsh love, The Italian chronicles one orphaned boy's incredible determination to reunite with his birth mother."

            "Like many Hong Kong mob movies, Triad Election</i is not about fleshed-out characters or intricate stories. It's a blunt, grimly efficient action movie that underlines the lies gangsters tell themselves so they, at least, can believe they're good guys.",

            "Renaissance is a victory of style over substance and technology over art, but to score a real win, the filmmakers need to strike a better balance between the two.",

            "Visualmente insosso (o jogo entre P&B e cor parece apenas querer chamar a aten\u00e7\u00e3o), o filme empalidece tematicamente diante de Kinsey e n\u00e3o retrata Page de maneira particularmente interessante, apesar da \u00f3tima performance de Mol.",
            "Men can ogle and evaluate all they want. The film's Bettie is what they've made, but she eludes them.",
            "The film was directed by Mary Harron from a screenplay she wrote with Guinevere Turner. In the past, these two did substantial work. Now they play, so that audiences may have the double pleasure of enjoying their porn while feeling superior to it.",
            "Stars Gretchen Mol in a terrific comeback performance as Page, the God-fearing woman from Tennessee who left Nashville for New York, where her aspirations of becoming an actress were interrupted, you might say, by a whip and a ball gag.",

            "Watching Mol in action in the title role, it's impossible to imagine anyone else in the part.",

            "Mary Harron's Bettie Page biopic is beautifully shot and features a terrific performance by Gretchen Mol, but it's also frustratingly vague and never gets beneath the surface."

            "The flashback structure adds nothing but length to an already awkward mix of humanist-socialist parable and gently halting love story that's been sat on a shelf since 2005. But even so, it's a surprisingly sweet little treat.",
            "Our movie of the week - which isn't saying much - arrives in the shape of this atmospheric slice of Americana about an arranged marriage deep in the heart of rural Minnesota.",

            "a gentle, well-observed drama... old-fashioned but in a good sense. ...Reaser and Guinee are such open, animated actors that Inge and Olaf's emotions are easily understandable even if their words are not.",

            "Stripped of much of the director's trademark deadpan humor and saddled with such an extremely passive protagonist, getting through the drama becomes an exercise in patience.",
            "Another in a series of Kaurismaki's deeply touching portraits of ordinary people, full of gentle and mournfully poetic subtle narrative rhythms.",
            "So stylized and slow-moving (even at a spare 75 minutes) that you may have trouble adapting to its hypnotic rhythms -- but if you can, there are sumptuous visual rewards to be found, plus the faintest emotional uptick right at the end.",
            "There's great music, an excellent dog, and that indescribable Kaurism\u00e4ki tension between misery and a cosmic joke.",
            "It's a handsome production, and a pleasure to watch."

            "What makes this film a real gem is Kervel's brilliant performance, personifying this stage of growing up with a perfect balance of bratishness, bright intellect, humour and innocence. She's a revelation.",

            "The film contains a surprising amount of understated humor.",
            "It's all too easy to read Blame It On Fidel as a simple morality tale, an allegory comparing conservatism to childishness, and political awakening to emotional maturity.",
            "Politics -- hardly a movie audience's immediate choice when it comes to entertainment -- becomes a deeply engaging subject in Blame It on Fidel thanks to a 9-year-old charmer who steals our hearts.",
            "A remarkably assured and elegant debut, Blame It on Fidel is the kind of smart, sophisticated and fiercely humanistic film that all movies should aspire to be, but seldom do.",
            "Gavras' film captures both the time period and the queasy inconsistencies of childhood. And in Kervel, Gavras has found a real gem."

            "Man About Town is frustratingly manic in its tone... the unevenness wears too thin too quickly.",
            "Binder's made some really fine movies and some curiously weak ones; my opinion is that this one falls firmly in the latter group.",
            "How dense is Binder? He uses an acoustic version of Our Lips Are Sealed to underscore a tender moment Jack recalls from his childhood. Because nothing says 1976 quite like an iconic song from 1981.",
            "has enough of a sense of humor to overcome the Affleck-induced malaise that you might otherwise be expecting",
            "...Binder's reliance on increasingly melodramatic elements effectively negates the film's few positive attributes...",
            "O desfecho, em sua \u00e2nsia de amarrar a narrativa com uma mensagenzinha engrandecedora, soa falso e n\u00e3o faz jus ao restante do filme, que utiliza muito bem o humor para desenvolver personagens quase sempre interessantes.",
            "Affleck's best performance since Good Will Hunting",
            "Like writer director Mike Binder's previous film, The Upside of Anger, there is bite in this comedy as it looks at relationships, inner-demons and resolutions. "

            "A must for movie lovers who want to see how so much drama, mystery and emotion can be created from so little.",
            "It should be noted that Red Road contains one extremely graphic sex scene. But like much else that transpires in Red Road, what is seen is not always what it looks like on the surface.",
            "For a voyeuristic medium, this tale of a voyeur does a poor job of prying into its own protagonist's life.",
            "...an erratic yet mostly rewarding debut...",
            " I firmly believe Andrea Arnold has directed Red Road in a responsible and appropriately complex fashion, but holy hell it sticks hard into the heart.",
            "Despite some elemental flaws in logic and plausibility, this is a tense and potent film at times that hints at the sort of greatness that we can find to a greater degree in Ms. Arnold's other works, Wasp and Fish Tank.",
            "No drab stone is left unturned",
            "Three-fifths of a great film, this stylish, Glasgow-based, Danish-inspired stalker drama does not deliver on its promise.",
            "Sets a chilling downer mood that gets under your skin like few films ever do.",
            "Ancorado pelas performances complexas de Dickie e Curran, o filme traz a diretora estreante Andrea Arnold como uma revela\u00e7\u00e3o a ser observada com aten\u00e7\u00e3o nos pr\u00f3ximos anos.",
            "A brilliantly conceived thriller that keeps us guessing right up to the very end, Red Road intrigues but frustrates by its slow development and often incomprehensible Scottish dialogue",
            "A strange sort of map of the city [is] spread across these fragmented cubes of visual information. And there's also the metaphorical map of the characters' lives, where they're coming from and where they're going.",
            "I like that you're never sure where this road is going to lead.",
            "Red Road is an atmospheric little thriller made up of equal parts paranoia, loneliness and anxiety.",
            "The glacially paced film is tersely episodic, and scenes are thrown onto the screen like jagged bits of raw meat that have been torn from a bone.",
            "It's a jarring sensation, for a thriller not to be about the chase, or the mysterious force of evil lurking in the shadows, but about an intangible gulf dividing two people occupying the same room.",
            "An impressive debut that is orchestrated with a deep, underlying tension that never lets us guess what will come.",
            "I couldn't get this film's quiet power out of my mind.",

            "Some chapters are more useful than others, but I'm not sure you could omit any of them, either, as each stroke provides a color that contributes to the overall picture.",

            "This beautifully made film was seamlessly woven with a warp of drama and a woof of newsreel. The drama to come made the newsreel of [George W.] Bush utterly gripping.",
            " Despite the audacious title and premise, Range doesn't aim to shock, but to unnerve",
            "What's missing is shapeliness, suspense, narrative cunning, visual flair -- in short, art. Are we really to believe that a network of the future would broadcast such a barbiturate?",
            "Dramatic escalation falls by the wayside and gives way to political axe-grinding. By the end, there's nothing to admire except Range's technical virtuosity.",
            "Range comes about these issues in a provocative way, but they're still worth discussing, aren't they?",
            "Just as the ducks get lined up in a row and we're ready for the movie to reveal its true purpose -- Political satire? Paranoid dystopian fantasy? Apologia for the Bush administration? -- we suddenly realize it has none.",
            "Easily the year's most useless picture",
            "Beyond the feigned controversy stirred up by neocon zealots, \"Death of a President\" is nothing more than a high concept political hypothesis film that signals the futility of presidential assassination.",
            "It is at least slick with technique -- or with a synthesis of techniques.",
            "Without directly confronting the behaviors and attitudes associated with its theory, the movie leaves us with uncertainty, vacillation, and worst of all, emptiness.",
            "The talking head interviews and other elements make for an intelligent analysis of our reactions and prejudices about such a situation. A must see.",
            "...even the extras are unconvincing...",
            "OK, so, it's got balls and technical skills, but is it anything more than a stunt? Yes, yes it is.",
            "There is little of the fall of the Twin Towers trauma, but much of All the President's Men here. That this film's buzz has launched such vitriol and condemnation is not surprising. Range's film exposes wider audiences to some basic truths of our times.",
            "Bush weepie takes all sides and none.",
            "It's hard to imagine anyone without a political agenda who can walk away from this serious, sober and impeccably respectful film and get agitated about it on its merits.",
            "As a piece of filmmaking, Death of a President is edgy and fresh, superbly realised and satisfying in its ambition to pass as a powerful documentary about an event that shook the world.",
            "It's not art, it's not a serious discussion, it's not a film based in irony or metaphor -- Death of a President is merely a marketing ploy that's big on shock value and short on ideas.",
            "So long as you think it's okay to depict a realistic-looking assassination of a sitting president via doctored news footage, then you're likely to enjoy this intriguing whodunit in which George Bush is blown away by one of his fed-up detractors.",
            "\"Death of a President\" is generally a sobering film that not only dares to think the unthinkable, but encourages its audience, no matter what their political leans, to stop and think as well.",
            "The movie does highlight the ways that news and commercial images shape public perception.",
            "Despite being heavy-handed and pretentious, and never providing a satisfying conclusion, Gabriel Range's fake-umentary \"Death of a President\" is nevertheless brilliant in its conception and execution.",
            "Accomplished and visually persuasive, but the movie's central conceit remains something of a stunt..."

            "Jacobson examines the life and death of the western and its incompatibility with the youth of today ... a fascinating, yet slightly off-balance, mix of tribute and scrutiny.",
            "The values of past and present collide in this beautifully shot, finely acted reexamination of the American Dream.",

            "The more you know about it the less likable it becomes.",
            "The movie does not waste the performances, but the screenplay could have served them better.",
            "Edward Norton and Evan Rachel Wood turn in strong lead performances, but their talent alone isn't enough to set David Jacobson's sun-bleached, modern-day Western on fire.",
            "A ludicrous, would-be Western hybrid.",
            "It spins out of control despite the best efforts of Norton.",
            "...if you don't require moral instruction with your popcorn, it's probably as close as you're going to get to a John Ford Western this year.",

            "... part homage to the Western genre and part eulogy to a disappearing American West, and the intentions of which are as cryptic and enigmatic as the look on Norton's face.",

            "Norton's brilliant performance walks the tightrope effortlessly, playing for our sympathies while arousing our suspicions. ",
            "There's no depth to the story, and as the thrills start to kick in, Down in the Valley becomes a B-movie - less a modern epic Western than a two-reel oater with a cheap cliffhanger."

            "The thing about Rocky Balboa is that it had no business being as good as it was.",
            "The problems facing Rocky are the same as those that Sylvestor Stallone must deal with: a once great career, a slide into obscurity and a return to the scene of your greatest achievement to relight a flame. That Stallone succeeds is down to a script.",
            "...a strong capper to an admittedly uneven series...",

            "Gbravica is a womanly movie in the best sense: [writer-director] Zbanic has a deeply feminine sense of how crisis gets filtered through the moments of daily life.",
            "The dramatic conflicts are soapy and unsubtle, but Karanovic pours intense authority into Esma's scarred psyche.",
            "A poignant and emotionally gripping story of a Bosnian single parent struggling to survive in Sarajevo and carrying deep physical and spiritual wounds from the 1990s wars.",
            "Zbanic's deeply personal saga allows us to see the savage price that women paid in the Balkan wars.",

            "From the first sight of German soldiers goose-stepping past the Arc de Triomphe to a postscript that spells out the fate of characters whose moral confusion is all too real, Army of Shadows is a movie of its time -- and ours.",
            "Unlike the romantic images of freedom fighters perpetuated by the popular media, Melville's movie is stripped of self-congratulatory hero worship and other puffery.",
            "For anyone interested in the impact of war on ordinary men, Army of Shadows proves a sobering and invaluable experience.",
            "Bleak and uncompromising.",

            "As bleak as it is compelling, it will leave you wondering if these freedom fighters haven't done more damage to each other than they have to the Nazi aggressors.",
            "a stunning, globetrotting spy masterpiece",
            "Rich in the elegance, assurance and quasi-formality that often define Melville's style.",
            "The fascination comes in minute observation of the Resistance soldiers' mannerisms, demeanor and interaction.",
            "It's hard to believe that Melville's 1969 masterpiece--one of the most accurate chronicles of the French Resistance--never got released in the US until 2006; Splendidly acted, this film draws on the helmer's own experience.",
            "Although it has several suspenseful sequences, \"Shadows\" is not a spy thriller, precisely. It's much more along the lines of a melancholy mood piece...",
            "A superb contribution from an A-class film-maker.",
            "One of the masterpieces of its era and its genre.",
            "ARMY OF SHADOWS is a remarkable and superb film, and American audiences should be rejoicing that is finally (if belatedly) has reached theaters.",
            "A fascinating picture of bureaucratic drudgery, even in the middle of war and occupation.",
            "There is nothing more to say, except 'Go.'",
            "Rare is the film that actually improves with time. Among that handful is the 1969 French thriller Army of Shadows.",
            "Melville stages riveting set pieces, tense little nuggets of men striking in the dark and dealing out death.",
            "It's a haunting and sublime work that offers a realistic but horrific account of the underground Resistance."

            "I'll wait breathlessly for 56 Up, and hope this brave group will speak to the camera again; giving us the gift of a share in their lives.",
            "Essential viewing",
            "There should not be an adult in the western world who isn't at least tacitly familiar with Michael Apted's groundbreaking documentary series based on the idea that a person's personality is formed by the age of seven.",
            "In 42 years has the series brought any insight into issues of class, politics, or culture? Perhaps only insofar as nearly all the participants, regardless of background, end up as the same bourgeois, middle-aged mediocrities.",
            "Time-lapse cinematography taken at seven year intervals.",
            "Even those wondering about the gaps and \"missing pieces\" or what will happen in the future will not be disappointed by this remarkable work.",
            "The wonder of 49 Up is its unfolding, within a little more than two hours, of so many specific lives...",
            "If there's a more remarkable series of documentary films, or even as remarkable a premise for one, I don't expect to see it in my lifetime.",
            "Doesn't tell us about these people's lives so much as it splashes a cold hourglass of water in the face, reminding us that time can slowly turn us into someone unrecognizable, especially to ourselves.",
            "Apted continues his seminal docu series with another riveting chapter. The film no longer belongs to him: Feeling their privacy has been invaded, the subjcets talk back, trying to shape their own narrative and even withhold vital information from him.",
            "A reality show that transcends that now-hackneyed phrase to become an utterly unique work of 'popular history'--and of art.",
            "As a viewer, I feel privileged to be able to peer into their private lives perchance to learn something useful about my private life.",
            "Now, they are middle-aged, and (unfair to spoil small surprises here) embedded in life with some learned wisdom.",
            "Surprisingly, the discussions of normal, average-life events are pretty fascinating and relatable. The films continue to be part of a moving sociological portrait of England and everyday life.",
            "The monumental 7 Up series continues with a lesser but worthwhile chapter, 49 Up.",
            "As always, [Apted] intercuts footage from the previous age levels and provides enough history to make each chapter a fascinating sociological examination in itself.",
            "... easily the best series ever made. 49 UP is an emotionally rewarding experience that is akin to vicariously living a dozen lives in just over two short hours.",
            "Though less extreme, the Up series suggests a real-life Truman Show, with subjects sometimes reluctantly allowing their lives to be recorded on film.",
            "On the cusp of their half-century mark, Apted's British subjects have accommodated themselves to what they were, what they are, and what they will be."

            "It compares to that other \"legitimate\" musical smash of recent vintage, Chicago. It just doesn't have the life or fun of Chicago.",
            "Few pictures can match the glamorous pull of Dreamgirls. Bill Condon's first big musical since Chicago is a glossy, gleaming Cadillac of a film with a vintage rhythm and blues engine tuned to perfection. The cast is dressed to kill.",
            "The opening rump-shaking immediately sets the tone: Dreamgirls pulses with sheer exuberance. When was the last time a musical, much less a huge Hollywood production, felt this alive?",
            "There is no single person or story to centre the drama around, and Murphy's performance, though widely liked and indeed now Oscar-nominated, is for my money flatly written with very little of the high comedy octane of which we know he is capable.",
            "The songs themselves aren't memorable so it helps greatly that they're delivered with gusto. Condon tries to pack too much in, however, and energy flags slightly towards the end. Ultimately it's Hudson's passion that keeps the dream alive.",
            "It has taken 25 years for Michael Bennett's Dreamgirls to go from Broadway to the big screen. The delay can be forgiven, however, because the film rocks on all levels. ",
            "Very much rooted in its disco-era decadence, but it is always fiercely, vibrantly fresh",
            "Neither thought-provoking nor entertaining enough - remains largely average and underwhelming.",
            "While Dreamgirls has many fantastic attributes -- brilliant musical numbers, top performances, and some amazing camerawork and editing -- it doesn't quite gel, ensuring that this musical never moves from being a good film to a supreme one.",
            "This film could earn eight Oscar nominations. It's so much fun. Let's go see a movie where you smile, and cheer ... and tap your feet a little, too.",
            "Condon's adaptation is polished and enjoyable and yet something is missing from making it a truly great musical movie--perhaps a more coherent vision or unity.",
            "A musical for people who've forgotten how to listen, and how to feel",
            "A tight and entertaining musical with a show stealing performance by Jennifer Hudson.",
            "Dreamgirls opened on Xmas day and it was every much of a brilliant holiday movie. I guess the only complaint I have is it is too slick.",
            "There's a joy on screen -- a love for the material that's palpable and contagious -- but the material, in the end, lets them down.",

            "Worse than a movie of the weak (pun intended)",
            "You may not be expecting this from a musical, but Dreamgirls is one of the most fast-paced, frenetically-edited, roller-coaster rides of a movie that you'll see all year.",

            "Youngsters will warm to the barn's talking animals and perhaps even shed a tear at the sight of a spider shuffling off the mortal coil. Arachnaphobes, though, are advised to approach with caution.",

            "Steve Buscemi's invigorating vocal characterization of Templeton the rat is the only high point in this sleep-inducing live action-animated revamp of the 1973 animated classic based on E.B White's 1952 children's book.",

            "Hardly the equal of Babe but the superior voice cast and Fanning's unforced charm make for another film that'll put you off pork forever.",
            "Never less than watchable, thanks to its superb cast, but kids will enjoy it more than adults will.",
            "Cute and sweet, and if it lacks great wit or magic, at least it has the courage to remain faithful to the gentle sadness and 'realism' of the original material.",
            "Manages to snuff the spark that has made Charlotte's Web so beloved over the years.",
            "Any tears you may shed will be wholly earned.",
            "This is only the second time in my life I cried over a spider. The first time was when I was a child and I accidentally stepped on a pet spider I had captured. This is an exceptional family movie."

            "It works best when Gilliam allows Jeliza-Rose to disappear inside her own mind, revelling in unrestricted solitude. ",
            "It is true that Gilliam makes his movies through fire and brimstone just by examining his extraordinary filmography, and there is no denying that Tideland is a film that was borne out of that.",

            "Now, I like pushing boundaries as much as the next guy. When it's done well, as in say Todd Solondz' wonderfully dark Happiness, it can be searingly challenging. But in the case of Tideland it's just uncomfortable to watch.",

            "Porumboiu's satire about history and short memories is a modest, deadpan masterpiece.",
            "12:08 East of Bucharest cleverly takes on the aftermath of the December 1989 revolution in Romania that resulted in the overthrow of Nicolae Ceaucescu. It's a movie that seems simple, yet its subtle and brilliant complexity is not to be denied.",
            "The only problem with the new Romanian cinema seems to be titles few can easily remember - but some eccentricity is permissible when the films are so good.",
            "A melancholy rumination on the failed hopes of Eastern Europe after the Cold War, infused with a sense of farce and the irrecoverable nature of the past.",
            "...12:08 East Of Bucharest doesn't pretend to have a position on the fallout of the Romanian Revolution. Instead it contends that different questions need to be asked and considered about post-Communist life... ",
            "The movie provokes low-key laughs (yes, it's a comedy), but with a sad overtone.",
            "You will laugh till the streetlights blink on again in the damp Romanian twilight.",
            "While 12:08 East of Bucharest could take more than one viewing to truly appreciate, it's worth the commitment.",
            "Dryly funny throughout its first half, the film truly comes to life in its final 45 minutes.",
            "Porumboiu's minimalist approach concentrates the movie's focus on its mournful characters, so disillusioned with their post-Communist life they question the history that led to it.",
            "The self-indulgent 12:08 East of Bucharest certainly takes its time getting to the point. In fact, the first third of this film could have been trimmed without much damage. And this Romanian comedy-drama is only an hour and a half in length.",
            "The film leaves off on a perfect note of hopeful melancholy.",
            "Human, savvy, funny, well observed; kudos to director Porumboiu for making something from nothing",
            "Extremely clever filmmaking--sharp and very funny, but also challenging and packed with relevance.",
            "A terrifically droll and slyly incisive comedy.",
            "The central European tradition of failed aspirations, lost ideals and forlorn eccentrics goes back to early Forman, or indeed Chekhov, but the Latin Romanians bring their own awareness of the distant big city alternately beckoning and frightening.",
            "It won the best first film award at Cannes; somehow, it doesn't seem quite substantial enough to justify that accolade.",

            "A funny, gentle film that understands the wearying nature of political upheaval.",

            "Sure, it's earnest -- sure, it's melodramatic. Yup, it's just barely this side of being a made-for-Lifetime TV soaper. But there's a mesmerizing power to this little film that comes from its sheer un-told-ness, from its right-now immediacy.",
            "Without question, an important, thought- and emotion-provoking film, certain to be controversial, and to be remembered.",
            "[Director] Winkler clearly loves these characters, and if he sometimes pushes too hard in his effort to make the audience share his affection it's forgivable under the circumstances.",
            "A predictable and not-bold-enough account of the struggles of a band of National Guard soldiers after returning home from the war in Iraq."

            "Humanizes the Iranians and shows that they're just as crazy about their sports as Westerners, if not more. If anything, it proves that soccer is truly an international language, providing an arena where anyone can communicate.",

            "A protest film that disarms the opposition with a feather, not a cudgel...",
            "If you like to see an inspirational sports film, with an amusing spin on the genre, then Offside is well worth the watch.",
            "From the Western perspective, the feisty protagonists' predicament might seem silly, until it gradually sinks in that this treatment is business as usual in a backward land that seems to have gotten stuck in the Middle Ages. Alley Oop lives!",
            "Jafar Panahi's film is disarming because it presents a mostly good natured, at times humorous, approach to issues that are extremely serious.",
            "A film of masks . . . Droll comedy and wry ironies artfully disguise Panahi's poignant questioning of national pride, governing the public good, and even the sadness mixed in with past victories.",
            "a gem that should not be missed.",
            "Its ruminations on secular Iranian nationalism are effectively couched within the characters, and the film, which won the Berlin Film Festival's Silver Bear but is banned in Iran, has a refreshing slyness to it, as if it's getting away with something too.",
            "Although the game is not seen, it provides a kinetic, real-time, documentary-like backdrop for a story structured like a game itself, albeit one where neither compassion nor logic apply, and at which everyone loses.",
            "It's not exactly exciting material, but Panahi's gentle humor and sense of realism keep it from becoming dull.",
            "Ultimately, satisfyingly joyous.",
            "If you're seeking a movie that entertains while introducing you to uniquely different ways of life, Offside scores."

            "American Hardcore, Paul Rachman's impressively thorough documentary, tells of the second-generation punk rockers who learned from the Sex Pistols and Ramones and then did their DIY thing.",
            "American Hardcore gets what most music lovers could not at the time: Sometimes, that noise in your head and that anger in your heart just has to get out, and there's always a guitar around somewhere.",
            "Instead of an insightful look at disaffected youths finding an outlet for angry energy in rock rages, American Hardcore is a slanted history lesson coming solely from its subjects.",
            "What's irritating about the movie is how much time it spends on empty nostalgia -- shouldn't real punks scorn reminiscing? -- and how little time it spends truly exploring the roots of America's punk prime in the early 1980s.",
            "Leaves little doubt that this truly was one of the wildest eras in rock.",
            "For a documentary ostensibly about the history of the hardcore punk music movement that reigned in America during the '80s, director Paul Rachman and writer Steven Blush indefensibly omit the genre's most talented and high-profile band (The Dead Kennedys)",
            "Struggles under the weight of its own ambition.",
            "The hit-and-run effect sometimes suggests a documentary equivalent to slam dancing, but without the bruises.",
            "Rachman's chronicle suffers not from a shortage of authentic footage of ready-made hardcore shows, complete with (completely necessary) subtitled lyrics, or doughy, balding, talking heads still bragging about the thrown punches and peed-on chicks of yeste",
            "A film for the fans, especially if you were one of those sonic youths venting steam at a guerrilla show in someone's basement, a VFW hall or club that condescended to present a hardcore show. For once-upon-a-time kids now irrevocably middle-aged, the kick",
            "AmericanHardcore ! Aboutboredstupidyouth! Didn'tliketheNewWave ! Gomoshin'fortruth ! Can'tfindtruth ! Can'tfindgrace ! SettleforHenryRollins! Punchin'dudesintheface !",
            "While this documentary features rare performance footage of hard-core punk-rock bands Black Flag and Bad Brains, it's not exactly the best-assembled or deepest cinematic exploration of the subject.",
            "Rachman's concert footage confirms that the music was unique: bruising, chaotic and blisteringly electric.",
            "\"American Hardcore\" harkens back to the time when punk rockers were actual punks, not whining, prefabricated MTV pretty boys.",
            "The movie preaches to the choir, and bores everyone else.",
            "Crammed with grainy, shot-on-the-fly mid-Eighties video footage, recent interviews, and a genuine love for its subject, American Hardcore encapsulates a largely forgotten moment in maximum rock & roll history.",
            "It's a great subject for a documentary, and director Paul Rachman does a good job of rounding up period footage and contemporary interviews. But for all its noise, his film is weirdly flabby.",
            "If band names like Circle Jerks, D.O.A., Dead Kennedys and Minor Threat resonate with you, then this documentary celebrating their short-lived, pummeling breed of thrash-and-burn rock music will surely get your blood boiling all over again.",
            "For the record, Rachman's punk-rockology has its cracks. While he worships at the altar of Henry Rollins and Black Flag, he excludes such key West Coast bands as X and the Dead Kennedys.",
            "Hardcore could have done with a little more self-criticism instead of self-congratulation, a little more outside commentary as opposed to inner-circle ramblings.",
            "You can come away feeling bruised and half-deaf.",
            "An energetic and grandly entertaining tribute to a short-lived period of early-'80s punk rock."

            "Watching Amy Berg's powerful documentary Deliver Us from Evil is a wrenching experience; her subjects reveal to the camera almost unbearable levels of anguish, and its audience walks away feeling both numbness and rage.",
            "Works best when it concentrates on O'Grady and the ever-rippling effect of his transgressions.",
            "Deliver Us From Evil has a few things wrong with it, including an egregious musical score, but without resorting to sucker punches, it takes your breath away while making your skin crawl.",
            "A stunning indictment of institutional betrayal. It plays like a Catholic Watergate, going right to the top with hard evidence that stuns, dismays and sickens.",
            "The film is painful viewing, in large part because director Amy Berg relates the facts and depicts the victims and the culprits with detached gravity.",
            "Berg's intuitively right ratio of personal and analytical material, her implied belief in transcendence of horrific demoralization, shows a truly progressive vision.",

            "Although each story is compelling, among the most heart-wrenching may be that of the Japanese-Irish couple who welcomed the new parish priest, who often slept over at their house, and who now feel responsible for letting the wolf in their door.",
            "A riveting, emotionally charged and startling big-screen experience. But it does more than just deliver to filmgoers. It may find a Holy Grail of real societal change for a larger constituency.",

            "It's intellectual without being dry, dramatic without bombast, smart without posturing.",
            "While the young people chatter about life and literature with sometimes overbearing self-satisfaction, the astute filmmaker observes their pretentious gum-flapping with a mixture of amusement, compassion, and wised-up rue.",

            "A much too tidy insightful clinical tale about students dealing with academic life and the pains of growing up.",
            "There are some schematics at work in the screenplay, but the film proves to be an entertaining, if frustrating, experience.",
            "This clever little film explodes conceptions and presents a good argument for the ends justifying the means.",
            "The dialogue in \"Poison Friends\" is clever and erudite, but underneath the lit-crit the film has the atmosphere of a Hitchcockian thriller.",
            "In this observant psychological drama with the energy of a thriller, there's no blood (except for maybe a paper cut) or weapons, but audible gasps will not be out of place.",
            "Sly, subtle and very French psychological drama.",
            "The movie seems an act of score-settling by someone who got singed by a critic. Fair enough, and Andr\u00e9's deviousness makes the film slyly credible, too.",
            "Has a degree of energy, an appetite for strong feelings and big ideas, notably missing in American movies about the young and overeducated, which tend to specialize in mumbled ironies and tiny epiphanies.",
            "Four university students band together under the obnoxious mentorship of Andre, who is meant to be brilliant but, to me at least, seemed all too obviously a poseur. His betrayal of his friends deepens the movie.",
            "Promoted as an intellectual suspense thriller, Emmanuel Bourdieu's second feature film is a chilling plunge into the dark pools of group think and a scalding examination of the vulnerability of the unformed identity.",
            "The movie is largely unclassifiable -- at once a psychological study, an exceedingly dry comedy, and a moral tale in which stories are purloined and frauds perpetrated.",
            "A solid script, but it's really the performance by Vin\u00e7on that's likely to leave a lasting impression on the viewer.",
            "Art-house fans young and old will revel in the film's evocation of urban student life and certain archetypes -- good and ornery -- who grace or despoil the groves of academe.",

            "As such, you want it to be a timeless triumph, but sadly it's a minor work.",
            "There is something reductive in all these talky explanations, nailing down the mysteries of fantasy and dream life that Bu\u00f1uel so audaciously left hanging.",
            "The film is a maddening mix of mild fascination and boredom. Bulle Ogier plays S\u00e9verine, as Deneuve opted not to reprise her role. Without her, the film lacks the required frisson.",
            "Belle Toujours is a teasing charmer from a Portuguese centenarian.",

            "It's the world contained in a single moment, or what one of the characters calls a giant teardrop of the universe, falling forever through space and time.",

            "Annoying, blank, and bereft of any narrative arc \"Old Joy\" has nothing familiar or enchanting to recommend it.",
            "The film is like a haiku that one can only interpret through their own experience.",

            "There are whispers of bigger themes present -- the changing nature of friendship, the co-opting of '90s \"alternative\" culture into the mainstream -- but, for the most part, much of what you get out of the film depends what you bring to it."

            "The film is both gritty and lyrical, showing how tanks share the Baghdad streets with donkeys as well as the quiet beauty of the Kurdish countryside.",
            "Because [director] Longley uses a technique that forgoes interviews and voiceover commentary in favour of observation and revealing juxtapositions, his movie puts you both in the chaos and just above it.",
            "Stands up as a classic war documentary, in its unusual poetic form and by its extraordinary access to the lives of ordinary Iraqis.",
            "Iraq in Fragments sometimes feels random, but it is a well-crafted, thoughtful study of the dueling divisiveness and hope that will define the region long after foreign troops leave.",
            "James Longley's devastating documentary Iraq in Fragments has neither narration nor obvious political ax to grind, but it manages to tell us something about Iraq that we aren't getting or can't get from standard news coverage.",
            "By turns tender and shocking, Iraq in Fragments strikes a rare balance between impromptu fluidity and feature-film narrative control, in the process resisting both partisanship and predigested points of view.",
            "Visually, the director's flair is impressive. But Longley's clear intention of using children's faces to better tug at our heartstrings would be more admirable if it didn't feel as shamelessly staged.",
            "Too bad James Longley couldn't have broadcast this insightful documentary immediately after he shot it in 2003 and 2004.",
            "Bafflingly, the threats in an occupied country consistently come from within, not without or overhead: what has the effect of the US occupation and Hussein's vicious rule been on these people? Offers a fragmented, obscuring picture of Iraq.",
            "Iraq in Fragments ... appears to be asking a simple, but often unmentioned, question: Oh yeah, what about the people of Iraq?",
            "A timely, lyrical and candid look at daily life in a post-invasion Iraq.",
            "The technique is more expressionistic than naturalistic, but it makes the film far more vivid and emotionally satisfying.",
            "The film is terrific at providing a kaleidoscopic sense of life unfolding, with imaginative editing and colors that seem to leap off the screen.",
            "What Iraq in Fragments lacks in fresh reportage or sending a political message, it makes up for with unique insight.",
            "[An] evocative, heartbreaking documentary told from three disparate but equally compelling perspectives: the Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds.",
            "We're used to seeing Iraq through the lens of washed-out digital video, so it's striking how sumptuous and elegantly-composed the shots are in \"Iraq in Fragments.\"",
            "Director James Longley doesn't say anything new about the politics of Iraq, but he leaves us with a vivid impression of its people, its places and its seemingly irreconcilable contradictions.",
            "In addition to the interesting camera work, the documentary's undeniable appeal comes in how close Longley gets to the characters, who are all male. They speak openly of the past, the U.S. forces, the uncertain future.",
            "Longley is a strikingly effective director",
            "There are embedded journalists in Iraq, and then there is \"Iraq in Fragments\" director James Longley.",
            "There are some striking images, but the film is less useful for not having any commentary on the confused events depicted.",
            "Watch the evening news and you get a view of Iraq from high above the wreckage. In this fascinating doc, director James Longley shows us how things look on the ground.",
            "James Longley's Sundance-winning documentary puts the camera uncomfortably close to scenes of abuse, violence, terror, cynicism and racial hatred amid the rubble of U.S.-occupied Iraq. But at the same time, its texture is frequently beautiful.",
            "In a series of stunningly filmed sequences, Longley and his camera seek out the real lives outside the frame of conventional TV news, and he succeeds in creating both compelling journalism and superb images."

            "Unlike recent Bonds, whose kills had no more weight than the one-liners that generally accompanied them, Craig's tend to be intimate, bloody, and devoid of glamour.",

            "You've never seen Bond like this before. Stand back, but stay watching.",

            "The film has breathless stunts and encounters aplenty. ",
            "In Daniel Craig, the producers found a suitably tarnished and brutal icon for this new iteration of Bond",
            "James Bond is back, and as it turns out, he's been gone a lot longer than anyone even realized.",
            "Bond is back. Bond is beefy. And the new Bond is blond. Daniel Craig has comfort ably slipped into the tuxedo, size 007, and left audiences shaken and stirred.",
            "When Bond kills an adversary in a hotel stairwell, the violence is nasty and brutal - and you feel bystander Vesper's shock and revulsion too. She doesn't merely wince and get over it, as so many of her predecessors did; she's clearly traumatised.",
            "Casino Royale is exactly what the franchise needs to keep in the game against the Bournes and Missions: Impossible of the world.",
            "This is a much more serious Bond than we've seen in many years. Daniel Craig inhabits the dark side of the secret agent really well, he is absolutely the best Bond since Connery.",
            "Craig's humanised, more flawed interpretation of the role balances Campbell's physical direction and co-writer Paul Haggis's sparing wit, while Eva Green provides an alluring love interest.",
            "I think this is a very intelligent film for a Bond film, and certainly one of the most enjoyable.",
            "This is a Bond movie, and everything comes back to him and the actor who plays him. The filmmakers took a big gamble on Daniel Craig and on a script that updates everything. This time, the gamble paid off.",
            "The screenwriters have brought Bond back toward the book.",
            "Why see yet another James Bond movie? Because Casino Royale, Martin Campbell's rewiring of the series, is a real movie, and not just a James Bond movie.",
            "The ace up the film's sleeve is Craig's foil, Eva Green, playing Vesper Lynd, the British accountant assigned to bankroll Bond's escapades. Calling her a Bond Girl would be an oversimplification."

            "Tykwer, best known for the ultramodern chase movie Run Lola Run, would seem an unusual choice for a period film, but he infuses the sometimes stately story with vigor; though well past two and a half hours, it never feels long.",

            "Unlikely as it sounds, a documentary that details with jaw-dropping candor how contemporary political campaigning works at the highest levels of government is set not in this country but in the far-off reaches of Bolivia.",
            "Political junkies will love this movie.",
            "This documentary by first-time director Boynton proves democracy and capitalism are disturbingly intertwined.",
            "Our Brand Is Crisis is not just for political junkies and should be widely seen and discussed.",
            "Absolutely riveting study of boneheaded intervention by James Carville consultants in Bolivian politics. Nearly as grotesque as Woody Allen's \"Bananas\".",
            "Crisis is angry and intrigued at the same time, and so are we.",
            "Purporting to expose the role of American public-relations companies in foreign political campaigns, Our Brand Is Crisis is never more than a dull and confused film about Bolivia's 2003 presidential election.",
            "It's tough not to root for them to succeed. That's a testament to Boynton's skill with the narrative.",
            "Our Brand Is Crisis scares me...",
            "Insightful if not altogether objective.",
            "Boynton's film explores the inescapable link between American democracy and capitalism and why what seems to work for us can be so disastrous elsewhere. ",
            "Boynton asks: That's the democracy we want to export? For well-paid political consultants like Carville, it's a rhetorical question.",
            "Boynton's main concerns are the exportation of American image advisers to other countries, and the notion that this faith in marketing is inherent in America's democratic ideology.",
            "It takes awhile to get to its point, but it has one.",
            "Rachel Boynton's painfully timely film is actually a full-court tragedy -- the sorry tale of a battle won and a war lost.",
            "Fascinating doc about how Bolivia markets its chief executive.",
            "This unlikely pairing of relentless U.S. pollsters and a Bolivian election is a fascinating glimpse of the Americanized marketing of international politics (and vice versa).",
            "Ultimately provides a vivid illustration of the not-so-hopeful future of international politics.",
            "Without ever getting strident or sanctimonious, the film vividly demonstrates the potential hazards of trying to export American-style democracy overseas."

            "This is a quietly powerful film about small-town Southern living that avoids all the usual clich\u00e9s and makes us feel as if we're dropping in on real lives in mid-stream.",
            "The baby-voiced costar of Chasing Amy proves an effortless filmmaker, turning Lucy's journey into the awakening of a soul.",
            "In Come Early Morning, Ashley Judd delivers her most natural screen performance since Ruby in Paradise, the film that pushed her toward stardom in 1993.",
            "In a way, the movie itself is an example of that philosophy put into practice. [Director] Adams clearly did a lot of soul-searching as she wrote the story. Her introspective script provides another actress with a great role and a new start.",
            "Beautifully photographed by Tim Orr, Come Early Morning is the kind of small gem that's becoming increasingly rare in American films.",
            "A beautiful character study acted superbly, COME EARLY MORNING is an uplifting winner.",
            "Judd surely deserves the lion's share of kudos for the movie's success...",
            "custom made for Judd; she's brilliant",
            "With an honest and starkly minimalist approach, Adams paints a vivid, often painful portrait of a woman who has nothing to look forward to except the next one-night stand.",
            "What Come Early Morning does is create an utterly convincing central character, and surround her with a milieu and backstory that is sincere and convincing.",
            "Overall, the film lacks energy and the plot has no driving force.",
            "The best thing about Adams' film is its unhurried, casual naturalism.",
            "The writing and directing by Joey Lauren Adams express an admirable naturalness and eschews rose-tinted solutions.",
            "...nothing less than a minor key wonder of a film, a character study of novelistic complexity with a sure sense of place and purpose that seems akin to movies made before Hollywood discovered its corporate destiny.",
            "Subdued and deliberate, but also sensitive and quietly moving. And it gives Judd a chance to shine as a real actress again.",
            "In fact this film is generally about nothing. There's an attempt to show some growth in some relationships, but there really isn't any and we're left where we started.",
            "It's a Southern story, but not cloying in the way that many Hollywood versions of the rustic South are.",
            "The film has a worn, live-in feel, and its unhurried narrative captures the subtle rhythms of small-town life. Nothing much happens on the surface, but worlds of hope, hurt and determination lie right behind the characters' eyes, waiting to be discovered.",
            "This intensely personal film may not bring either [Joey Lauren Adams and Ashley Judd] widespread acclaim, but it's a small triumph nonetheless."

            "Candor wins points almost anywhere, and that's what Zahedi has, in spades.",
            "That self-indulgent documentary form, the biographical essay film, earns its most onanistic installment ever.",
            "The narrowness of [Zahedi's] sexual repertoire is the springboard for a charming and boundless homemade sort of filmmaking.",
            "... Zahedi tries to construct a narrative from his epic bad behavior, presumably for the purpose of shedding light on something. What this is remains mysterious after a single viewing, but not so mysterious as to inspire a second.",
            "The filmmaker's ability to at once mock himself and consider his dilemma with compassion transforms an otherwise smarmy tale into something honest and insightful.",
            "Zahedi isn't afraid to put himself out there, even when his thoughts and actions are profoundly unflattering.",
            "The movie nonetheless can't sustain the thin interest of a man's obsession with outlaw fellatio.",
            "This strange little movie is a mixed bag, hard to eagerly recommend but also hard to completely dismiss.",
            "a fun and unique movie that isn't soon forgotten",
            "Even if you can keep it in your pants, you'll be tickled and intrigued by Zahedi's look at why he couldn't.",
            "At 98 minutes, Addict demands an investment not repaid by its basic unpleasantness.",
            "Self-involved and self-indulgent. It's almost as if [Zahedi] made the movie for himself, for his loved ones and for no one else.",
            "Making this confessional film may have been therapeutic for Zahedi, but it's pure torture for an audience.",
            "Zahedi is wry and certainly fearless as he pours his sex life onto the screen, but around the ninth time he goes cruising for prostitutes it gets a little hard to take. ",
            "Zahedi pulls off the difficult trick of making you despise, pity and admire him. You get the feeling it's been much the same for the women in his life.",
            "I kinda don't wanna burst Zahedi's bubble, because at least he's being open and exploratory and honest about how infatuated with himself he is, which is more than can be said for most men, but still: Bwahahaha, get over yourself, dude.",
            "... the film's flaws stem from 'TMZ' -- too much Zahedi.",
            "... while some may bail early, those who stay to the end are likely to dwell on Zahedi's unwavering (some would say unrelenting) belief in his own artistry, as well as the film's many funny, quotable lines ...",
            "Consequently, I Am a Sex Addict is ruthlessly frank in its freakish frivolity and absurdly lyrical in the grubby ramblings of its professed and confused cad.",
            "Zahedi demonstrates that he's a diary-film maker who can transcend confession -- and its lurid cousin, exhibitionism, too.",
            "It's hard to disapprove of Zahedi, who is far more of a pushover, or a patsy, than the fierce and knowing women he meets.",
            "Whether you find either man funny or infuriating depends in large part on whether you identify more with their narcissistic quests for self-knowledge or the collateral damage left in their wakes.",
            "I Am a Sex Addict starts out amusingly. But, as any one-joke movie is bound to, it quickly becomes tiresome."

            "Mongolian Ping Pong takes you far, far away, and it's a beautiful place to be.",
            "Less concerned with its plot, which is gossamer-thin and not terribly involving, than with describing the nature of the lives these inhabitants of the remote steppe lead.",
            "With wonderfully natural performances by the children, this is a family movie that crosses cultural boundaries in a celebration of the magical possibilities inherent in everyday objects.",
            "If only puerile wish-fulfillment didn't so often feel like patronizing bullcrap onscreen.",
            "Mongolian Ping Pong will likely get only limited art house exposure and this will be a shame.",

            "Affecting feature from first-time director is an exercise in restraint.",
            "Like the best films about children -- and Iranian filmmakers have been particularly good at this -- it puts the camera right among them, and sees the often-confusing world of adults through their eyes.",
            "Movies don't come any more charming than Mongolian Ping Pong.",
            "The film's sly charms sneak up on you, if the beautiful and frequently breathtaking vistas of the wind-swept steppes haven't gotten to you first.",

            "A slyly amusing blend of fact, fantasy and hearsay set in England in 1997.",
            "Frears's movie pays Britain's first family the supreme compliment of taking it seriously, and it's hard not to feel that the results will enjoy a long and fruitful reign in the affections of moviegoers.",
            "The film makes brilliant use of juxtaposition to underscore the class divide between the Windsors and the Blairs. ",

            "The Queen will knock your socks off.",

            "Surely to be considered at Oscar time.",

            "Of interest even to those not particularly interested in the subject of farming.",
            "A beguiling combination of agrarian ode and The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, deepened by Peterson's square sincerity as he struggles to find himself in relation to his family's land.",
            "The Real Dirt on Farmer John turns into a portrait of how American family farming could blossom for a new century.",
            "Warmhearted.",
            "'What do you do when nothing is left?' is the question that drives The Real Dirt on Farmer John.",
            "It also, not incidentally, an inspiring vision of the way forward for food production, a portrait of what Peterson calls \"a dead farm coming back to life\". After reading The Omnivore's Dilemma, it may be just the antidote you need.",
            "Inspiring, instructive, humorous, dramatic and moving, The Real Dirt on Farmer John is something special",
            "The Real Dirt on Farmer John offers no discovery or mystery into the Peterson family or their farm, only matter-of-fact self-importance.",
            "Yes, John Peterson is a flake, but he's a likable oddball, a rebel you can get behind.",
            "It's fascinating that this portrait of the rise, fall and rise of Midwestern organic farmer John Peterson can be read in so many different ways, only some of which appear intentionally in Taggart Siegel's sympathetic documentary.",
            "Despite an occasional tendency to ramble on and hold forth, it stands as a worthwhile tale of down-home alternative Americana.",
            "A triumph of baby boomer ideals, that work and art can and ought to coexist.",
            "Like its title character, The Real Dirt on Farmer John is a simple, effective movie with a lot on its mind.",
            "Taggart Siegel's loving portrait of eccentric farmer John Peterson is an epic writ small that focuses on a life lived almost entirely on a Caledonia, Ill., farm yet encompasses six decades of changing American social mores and economic upheavals.",
            "It does leave you smiling -- and just a little bit hungry.",
            "Don't be surprised if, by the finish, you wind up fantasizing about your own rural homestead.",
            "What a blessing this film is, for everyone who's chosen the road less taken, and even perhaps for anyone who's stood in their way.",
            "At times, the film plays like an extended infomercial for John's new company, Angelic Organics, but the agrarian fantasy is so compelling here that the revitalization of the American family farm begins to seem not just possible, but probable.",
            "A beautiful documentary. Completely fascinating, with a topic that hits home even if home for you isn't a farm. Bio of a guy, not a celebrity, politician, nor rich person.",
            "By the time the end credits come along, you're about ready to pat your new friend on the back, careful to avoid ruffling that feathered boa.",
            "A genuine, no-frills, working person's story of giving as much to the world as you reap from it. ",
            "He has the rough hands of a hard-working farmer but the soul of a reflective poet, and he brings both to bear in telling his story. "

Al\u00e9m disso, sua falta de foco leva-o a parecer um mero instrumento de propaganda, o que \u00e9 lament\u00e1vel.",
            "This uncritical bio-pic presents Al as more of an intellectual on a mission than a funnyman in search of laughs, leaving one to wonder whether the purpose here was to makeover Al into a political figure for his rumored run for the U.S. Senate.",

            "The documentary skims the surface, appreciating Franken's crass, troublemaking modus operandi. This would be OK if the doc were crammed with hilarious footage, but Franken comes off as more droll and bitter than clever.",
            "With his nearly nonstop, self-congratulatory monologues and his seemingly insincere attitude, he comes off as every bit as much an insufferable blowhard as his conservative counterparts.",
            "The film feels unfinished as Franken contemplates a run for the U.S. Senate from Minnesota, which might make God Spoke the set-up for a much more interesting sequel.",
            "As a record of the Al Franken you already know and love, Hegedus and Doob's rather slapdash movie is fun.",
            "Neither as adroitly funny as Franken's comic routines, nor as notable as his conversion to the fine art of politics, this is a 90-minute 'What If?' with no discernible answer.",
            "Franken doesn't allow the knee-jerk predictability of his liberal pronouncements to deflate the great gasbag that he becomes as the movie proceeds.",
            "Most of this doc is content to wander through Franken's recent show-biz resume, to no particular end.",
            "What is notable about the film is that, despite the fact that it is centered on Franken, filmmakers Nick Doob and Chris Hegedus let everyone have their say, even if Franken gets the usually quite funny last word."

            "Mini's First Time is not about taking an honest look at adolescence. It's not even really about teens, or high-school life, or upper-class marriages. What it's about is an unpleasantly pervy adult male view of teenage girls.",
            "Surrounded by all these pros, Reed more than holds her own: She has so much integrity about being amoral that she keeps the audience dangling between disgust and admiration.",
            "Mini has a cleverly devious wrap-around ending, but you have been warned: It's twisted.",
            "The swirl of bad girl shenanigans, Hollywood satire and noir-ish melodrama in Mini's First Time that was intended to make for an icy cocktail of prurience and moral insight tastes more like freezer burn instead.",
            "Guthe is so anxious to show us what a larcenous tramp Mini is that he never shows us any other sides to her. We have her pegged from the get-go, even if no one in the movie does.",

            "Mini's First Time is a down-and-dirty exercise in depravity and debauchery; in other words, just the kind of plot that gets us to turn off the TV and head for the multiplex -- blue states and red states alike.",
            "Much of the film reeks of decadence and new money-the snazzy cars and clothes and the boxy, minimalist modern stone and glass interiors that are as cold as the characters themselves.",
            "Touches fleetingly on an interesting phenomenon - namely, the manner in which a father's advances simultaneously disgust and enthrall his teenage stepdaughter.",
            "Mini is a wonderful character, and she's the villain you simply can't help but root for, watching the dominoes fall where they must, and lets these yuppies self-destruct.",
            "Trashy but fun, Mini's First Time is like one of those paperback books you might take to the beach. You don't brag about having read it, but you enjoy every page.",
            "A deliciously evil black comedy that's sure to elicit lots of shameful giggles throughout.",
            "Pitch-black and bound to offend anyone who's not on its wavelength, Nick Guthe's entertainingly slick debut is a mordantly funny slice of lust, crime and sleaze life set in the world of L.A.'s industry elite.",
            "The director has created a stylish spoof filled with some razor-sharp dialogue and truly wild, original moments.",

            "Mini is impossible to like, especially since she delivers some of the worst narration ever spoken, and her final lines are like a big middle finger to viewers foolish enough to enjoy the film.",
            "A cheeky neo-noir that updates Double Indemnity for the high school set, Mini's First Time trades in black humor so dim you'd need a flashlight to find it.",

            "As a piece of entertainment, there's no getting around the fact that the film rises or falls on the degree to which the clips from Wilson's productions grab the viewer's attention and the ideas they embody arrest the mind.",
            "Impressive as is Wilson's output and oeuvre, it's the fully-engaged, aesthetically driven life that fascinates. And Otto-Bernstein's movie is a portrait of an artist at his most essential, in every sense.",
            " Katharina Otto-Bernstein's documentary provides an excellent introduction to the singular vision of avant-garde stage director Robert Wilson.",
            "Absolute Wilson may not be original, but Wilson absolutely is.",
            "A good introduction to those unfamiliar with the artist, while it should also be pleasing to his fans.",
            "Yet Otto-Bernstein's clips, though well-chosen, never convey what seeing Wilson live is like...Her book is much more stimulating.",

            "Though it doesn't make Wilson's art any less obtuse, it certainly helps us connect to the man who created it.",
            "Wilson is the prime example of what happens when money is continually thrown at a voracious ego -- its creative universe keeps expanding until the money stops. One problem is that most of Wilson's works don't 'snapshot' very well as excerpts.",
            " ... presents the general chronology of Wilson's life, which is certainly interesting ... but it's unclear whether the movie serves his work well...",

            "Intriguing.",
            "Though more celebratory than truly critical, and dealing more with the artist than the private eperson, being the first docu of one of the century's most innovative creators has both historical and aesthetic merits.",
            "It's recommended for Wilson fans and those who are interested in fringe entertainment.",
            "Over all, though not surprisingly, the result is too sharply slanted in favor of Wilson's genius rather than in questioning his talent.",

            "The film includes generous amounts of archival footage of his work, but the film's genius is to get us inside those works. Wilson's own recollection of his work is the biggest key to understanding what make him and it tick.",

            "Apocalypto demonstrates two things: that Mel Gibson is a hell of a filmmaker and that his imaginative world borders on the Neanderthal.",
            "It's Gibson's taste for carnage that defeats him in the end. The brutality is relentless, and the many ways in which blood is spilt so ingenious, that it's numbing. Once the adrenaline rush subsides, there's nothing left.",
            "Pathologically brilliant. It is bizarre, stomach-turningly violent and frequently inspired.",
            "This is by no means a boring film, then, but it is a grotesque one, and that brings it pretty close to camp.",
            "As a piece of filmmaking it's certainly strong enough to restore his commercial viability. Whether that's to the good is another question entirely.",
            "While the ancient dialects and weighty quotations suggest an arthouse epic, Apocalypto is basically a really good period popcorn flick.",
            "Gibson continues to tackle historically-tinged, grand-scale adventures unlike anything before them.",
            "Apocalypto is the very best thing Gibson has done as a director, and should not be missed because of a shared repugnance for his off-screen worldview.",
            "If Mel Gibson is a mad genius, then Apocalypto may be his most insane work yet.",
            "There is something different in Gibson's application of violence. The objections seem to lie not just in Gibson's realistic portrayal of cruelty but in the judgment he brings to it.",
            "A quite exciting spectacle based on a racist version of indigenous history, one in which the genocidal conquistadors are the New World's liberators.",
            "Apocalypto isn't simply an effective movie, but an immensely powerful one: a benchmark and a foresight seemingly all rolled into one.",
            "Ignore Apocalypto's symbolic hubbub and instead view it for Gibson's perverse sense of entertainment. His passionate spectacle of human destruction and doom packs a terrific visceral punch.",
            "Shot with digital camera on location in Mexico, Mel Gibson has created a visually stunning action/adventure epic that although has divided many with its historical accuracy, has spared no expense in bringing life to a world before European colonization. ",
            "Nothing if not visceral",
            "All in all Apocalypto is probably Gibson's best film to date, because it's almost free of any of Hollywood's tainting.",
            "Mel Gibson follows up \"The Passion of the Christ,\" his entr\u00e9e into directing schlock B-move horror films with high production values, with an even more gory study into bodily torture and death.",
            "The middle of the film, though, finds Gibson at his sadistic best, depicting monumental savagery with a surreal cinematic glee that puts the Apocalypse in Apocalypto.",
            "What this thing turns out to be is a skimpy action flick.",
            "If you can get past Mr. Gibson's public persona, Apocalypto is a good, solid action movie.",
            "Any Gibson-haters hoping to see the heart ripped out of his success may well find themselves disappointed by Apocalypto's relative merits.",
            "Apocalypto is a strange but largely entertaining mix of action, bloodletting, chin-rubbing and arthouse trimmings.",
            "How can we be inspired by the spirit of Jaguar Paw when the film's telling us that people stink and the great cultures of the Americas were the architects of their own demise?"

            "As if anticipating bad reviews, Russo ends his scattershot assault with a preemptive strike against the media: 'It's just the Federal Reserve System trying to save itself.' If you buy that line, then I'm the great-grandson of a 1913 conspirator.",
            "Aaron Russo's America: Freedom to Fascism can't even think straight, it's so mad.",

            "If Russo really wanted to attract an audience, he should have called this: Why You Don't Have To Pay Taxes! Now that's a title that would get people in the seats.",

            "Fincher, more subdued ... and aching for a return to smart suspense films from the likes of Sidney Lumet and Alan J. Pakula, pulls us by the collar into the frame and cranks the sense of menace taut without cheap tricks or cop-out gimmicks.",

            "Fincher presents plausible theories that are not rammed down our throats. ",
            "Zodiac is a film that really takes its time, but does a masterful job of showing how these killings didn't just destroy the lives of the victims and their families, but how the case became a burden to almost everyone involved.",
            "Zodiac is not just a masterclass in film-making and storytelling, it's proof that a horror movie does not have to be showy to be scary.",
            "The first half of the movie plays like a police procedural... It's a thrilling whirlwind of facts and dead ends and terrifying attacks that increasingly adds to the sense of helplessness with the case.",
            "A disturbing, meticulous, brilliantly written and darkly evocative re-creation of a time and a place that captures every feeling and nuance of an entire era. ",
            "If Fincher wasn't so adamant that his film was a totally factual representation of the case, Zodiac would be a far better piece of fictionalised history.",
            "Downey Jr is perfect as the alcoholic wastrel of a crime reporter Paul Averi, as is Mark Raffalo as the dependable cop David.",
            "An ironic commentary on the complexity and inherent difficulties of old-fashioned, paper-heavy, analogue detective work. ",
            "It's Fincher's attention to detail that makes Zodiac so remarkable and his most mature, rather than his most entertaining, work.",
            "It's a movie for masochists, and for the most part enthralling.",
            "The low-key thriller is as much a study in obsession and detail as it is a murder mystery, and Fincher is appropriately obsessive in his attention to detail...",
            "The crowning achievement of its director's career, a masterwork stubbornly faithful to its source material even while transcending it.",
            "[It's] a story about the elusive nature of evil in a world that thinks information ... will eventually solve our problems.",
            "Among a plethora of skillful thrillers about repeat offenders in the realm of mass murder, David Fincher's wonderful film has easily become the benchmark of the modern era.",
            "A complex crime drama that limits its action, opting to save it for the times that bring the greatest impact."

            "Ultimately, the film reveals more about Block than about his private, remote mother and father.",
            "If it is the objective of a work of art to hold up a mirror to our own lives, then 51 Birch Street, in all its makeshift craftsmanship, is a great work of art.",
            "A portrait of a marriage, Capturing the Friedmans-style.",
            "a documentary for every Baby Boomer, and every Boomer parent, to ponder",
            "Leads us through a nice range of emotions and invites us to contemplate our own parents' lives",
            "There is nothing more mysterious than the secrets of the people around us, and from the unraveling of this mystery Doug forms a beautiful portrait of an unfulfilled woman.",
            "Reflecting upon the complications of post-war marriage in the pre-divorce age, Block's film does presenting an interesting and intensely intimate tale about his own parents.",
            "Doug Block delves effectively into family mysteries without offending or showing disrespect to any of the parties involved.",
            "In families, especially, perceptions are relative . . . reminds us that the seemingly mundane, right at our dinner tables, can offer its own special, bittersweet poetry.",
            "51 Birch Street, like the best of the recent wave of personal documentaries, is both a compelling story and an eye-opening bit of social history.",
            "The overall effect makes one ponder how much we really know about our parents, as well as how much we really want to know.",
            "Just as Doug starts looking at his own marriage through new eyes after reading about his parents', so will most viewers. \"51 Birch Street\" could be any address in America.",
            "We'd all be better off if we could find our grace without a camera's obstruction, but ironically, Block's film provides a useful direction to see our way.",
            "It's a fine film, and it's practically guaranteed to make you think about your own relationships.",
            "The film has a compelling way about it. All five of the immediate Block family members emerge in full and affecting portraits.",
            "An intensely painful, personal and cathartic movie of a man coming to accept his parents as people with flaws, problems and regrets.",
            "A warm and honest portrait of a marriage at its most mysterious, and ordinary.",
            "The intimate history of Doug Block's parents becomes fodder for a broader look at family secrets in this complex documentary."

            "It's the canine players who carry the movie and will capture the hearts of viewers young and old.",
            "The film is padded out to a full two hours, which may not be quite as long as the dogs have to wait for their rescue, but it does feel like it.",
            "The human interaction is just a little too precious and the digression away from the dogs and the main story is just too long for it to feel like anything but a major detour.",

            "While the movie's discussion points certainly rank on par with those political thrillers, there's not enough substance for the movie to succeed on its own merits, a point underscored by posters selling the movie on Newton's perfectly airbrushed chest.",
            "A polemic masquerading as a movie, Poster Boy unspools like a humorless lecture on right-wing homophobia.",
            "Although audiences will admire the film's do-it-yourself energy and commitment, Poster Boy finally collapses of its own contrived weight, deflating just when it should soar into madcap -- or at least thoughtful -- satire.",
            "An overwrought story of American politics and image-making that really only gets interesting in the final act.",
            "Some clunky writing and a distracting subplot limit the effectiveness of this ambitious low-budget indie.",
            "Poster Boy is a muddled coming-out movie that, for no good reason, unfolds flashback style as Henry tells his story to a sleazy newspaper reporter.",
            "Newton gives a very nuanced take on a character growing and changing before our eyes, and Noseworthy is nifty as a kind of Kevin Bacon-like trickster. Not to be missed.",
            "We all sat around in college having the sort of angry liberal rap sessions that this film painstakingly recreates. We don't have to relive them now.",
            "Offers an affirmation that conservatives are not ready to cast that proverbial first stone.",
            "The people do not reduce to issues, but we know they will hit their issues marks reliably.",
            "The film touches on a number of hot-button issues, including homophobia, the ethics of outing, and the intersection of public and private lives, but it suffers from an excess of subplots.",
            "The tale is unnecessarily fractured and becomes increasingly didactic as it collapses into a mess of shrill big-screen activism and smugly relayed leftist ideals.",
            "Tucker's heart is in the right place. His work, however, isn't: Lectures belong in school, not in the movie theater.",
            "Even with satisfying performances from the principal actors, Poster Boy is longer on energy than focus.",
            "Director Zak Tucker is a bit too fond of jump cuts as signifiers of edginess. Still, when the material doesn't get in the way he's pretty good at getting across the emotional content.",
            "Coming during a period in which the collision of politics and gay rights has created perhaps unprecedented sparks, Poster Boy is a flawed but absorbing drama.",
            "Screenwriters Ryan Shiraki and Lecia Rosenthal exploit red state/blue state tensions, scripting an act-up soap opera that unintelligently panders to pro-gay sentiment.",

            "One of the classic films of the German silent era.",

            "What My Country, My Country does best is show us that while both the Americans and the Iraqis care about the country's future, their cultural backgrounds and world views inevitably make them seem alien to each other.",
            "... sobering documentary ...",
            "The movie attempts to paint too large a canvas.",
            ". . .[Director Laura] Poitras' film allows ordinary Iraqi people to state their experiences and their understanding about what is happening in their country. Their plainspoken words have far more impact than any series of talking head interviews.",
            "Powerful and moving.",
            "Part of the problem with the film, though, is that some of the scenes with the doctor and his family and the doctor and his patients have a staged feel to them -- as if, they were also putting on a \"show.\"",
            "Poitras demonstrates fine judgement in making Dr. Riyadh the central focus of her well-detailed story.",
            "The documentary maintains an observant distance from the sweep of history, and even the elections.",
            "Poitras creates a vivid portrait of Iraqi civilians siding with neither the U.S. occupation nor the insurgents but just looking for the killing to end.",
            "... day-to-day life under occupation where citizens still live without power... and extremist rebels wage a campaign of intimidation against Iraqis and Americans alike.",
            "The camera should never leave the four walls of the Riyad family home. Beyond that story, there is a dullness to the pacing and the wider tale of the Iraqi elections.",
            "Despite some flaws--docu doesn't illustrate the political backdrop or explains where the Sunis fit vis-a-vis the Kurds, Shia, Arbas--Poitras' feature is essential in venturing into new grounds that no journalists or directors have previously explored",
            "The film delivers powerful images of a country mired in chaos, where explosions, gunfire, power outages and unrest rule the day, leading to a national despondency that understandably fails to rise above the endemic suffering and daily death.",
            "Remarkable.",
            "Journalism at its finest, as has not been practiced in the U.S. in some time.",
            "The fascinating story of the heroism of a busy Sunni doctor in Baghdad running for parliament in Iraq's January 30, 2005, election. ",
            "It's interesting from the standpoint of giving faces to the news stories, but the documentary isn't all that compelling.",
            "Though the events have a rambling overfamiliarity, there's a real story between the lines: the resentment over the U.S. occupation on the part of non-insurgent Iraqis.",
            "Quietly damning.",
            "Is Laura Poitras in favor of the event she is filming or against it?",
            "Poitras boldly dispenses with the traditional documentary voice-over, but her film is filled with telling moments that are far more eloquent than any scripted narration."

            "Abduction unfolds as a tightly plotted mystery, and it wouldn't be fair to reveal much more than that.",
            "The story it tells is a shattering mystery of violation and loss, if only because by the end, certain answers only lead to more punishing questions.",

            "Details a Japanese cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre with ramifications for Pacific Rim Asia and, today, for world politics at the highest levels.",
            "Abduction pushes its poignant buttons while casting Megumi's kidnapping as a heinous crime, yet to its credit, it consistently does so with a deftly understated, devastating touch.",
            "It sounds like something out of a Robert Ludlum novel, but it's heartbreakingly true, as the documentary makes clear by looking at the phenomenon not from the top down or the outside in, but from the bottom up and the inside out.",
            "Eschewing the geopolitical for the personal, Sheridan and Kim manage to tell a sweeping Cold War saga that is at its most undeniably powerful when it is focused tightly on the tracks of two parents' tears.",

            "Not just a story of a person but a story of a neighborhood, a city and a plan to escape.",
            "Stylistically, it plays like an ESPN profile more than a serious documentary, but the issues and drama is all real enough -- and so is the big-league money.",
            "It's a pleasure to see the articulate, disciplined Telfair succeed where so many other young men have failed, but ultimately his path to success is so smoothly upbeat that there isn't much urgency to it.",

            "This is an exceedingly friendly portrait, a disarming one, too. The filmmaker invites us to reconsider the author as someone warmer and less intimidating than his body of work. On that count, Wrestling With Angels succeeds.",
            "The final portrait is unquestionably entertaining, very occasionally teasing and largely adoring. Because Kushner is a devoted political commentator, his thoughts on everything from America's role in the world to the nature of Zionism are on full display.",
            "Wrestling with Angels is personal and intimate, insightful about Kushner as well as instructive about his collection of works.",
            "Wrestling With Angels is a canny piece of filmmaking, sure to absorb both audiences familiar with Kushner's plays and those who know little or nothing about him.",
            "A sentimental valentine to a man who, underneath it all, simply wants to move people with his message.",
            "This uncritical cinematic embrace doesn't do justice to a playwright who never met a Brechtian dialectic he didn't want to ponder more deeply.",
            "Beyond it's educational value for those unfamiliar with Kushner's work, politics, and sexuality (like myself), there's not much to grab onto here.",
            "A rich and uplifting film.",
            "[Director Freida Lee] Mock's approach to Kushner is so casual and friendly that it never steps outside of his own life for a glimpse of its context.",
            "A worthwhile but imperfect film.",
            "Flaws aside, Wrestling With Angels: Playwright Tony Kushner is still worth a look for its glimpse at one of the leading voices of 21st century American drama.",
            "While Wrestling With Angels is definitely a worthwhile experience, you'd expect it to be a more dramatic one, considering what Kushner has produced.",
            "It's a loving film, but Kushner's own characters are more richly textured than Mock's depiction of the playwright and the divided, divisive world he's trying to fathom.",
            "The essence of the film is that [Kushner], with not a touch of evangelistic pomp, cannot conceive of life as anything other than a campaign to improve life.",
            "Wrestling With Angels paints an intimate and detailed portrait of playwright Tony Kushner, in the years since he became the most important living American dramatist.",
            "An overly adoring but still quite interesting profile of the writer.",
            "Freida Lee Mock's adulatory portrait makes for pleasant viewing -- but should it? Her subject is a professional rabble-rouser, an intellect determined to provoke a sleeping world into action.",
            "Although the analysis is far from deep, Mock's film succeeds as an above-average introduction to the playwright, especially to an audience unfamiliar with his work.",
            "Even if you're not a fan of his work, it's a good thing to see, and is worth a view when it gets on TV sometime in the new year.",
            "Mock is good at seizing a subject and exploiting it for her own purposes. But one doesn't get the feeling that she, unlike Tony Kushner, wants to get her hands dirty.",
            "More of a mash note than an even-handed documentary.",
            "As informative as it is, Wrestling With Angels doesn't have time to do more than scratch the surface of its fascinating subject.",
            "Wrestling with Angels could use some brouhaha: It's a bit too much of a pleasant air kiss from a fan, and doesn't engage inquisitively enough with Kushner's often controversial and very political ideas.",
            "Mock's film leaves us with a sense of gratitude and relief that so thoughtful an artist as Kushner continues to work among us, capturing and reacting to the world as he buzzes through it."

            "The film looks like it cost 10 cents, but a lot of the jokes are gold. Hollywood, take notice of writer-director James Westby.",
            "The film's press notes proudly observe that both Westby and Quentin Tarantino spent time soaking up celluloid while working at video stores. Which means they have exactly one thing in common.",
            "Film Geek has a likable premise and a pleasantly homemade indie feel. Unfortunately, its lead character is so irritating you want to get away from him.",

            "Here, getting there is all the fun, and this flick is stocked with laughs galore, all at the expense of the most clueless loser since Napoleon Dynamite.",
            "It's so very easy to love Film Geek, especially if you are one.",
            "Amusing (and, at 72 minutes, in and out of there fast), with a diabolically dweeby performance by Melik Malkasian.",

            "there's enough magic here to merit a viewing or two.",

            "For people who know their cinema, I recommend FILM GEEK not just as a comedy, but a cautionary tale as well.",
            "Detailed in its affectionate mockery, the film captures the social isolation that befalls guys like Scotty but understates their own complicity on it.",
            "Westby's escapist fantasy's happy ending falls short of a meaningful message in spite of a rib-tickling individual effort by lead Melik Malkasian.",
            "On its own terms and for that small audience it owns, the film delivers.",
            "Film Geek is a delightful, sad, witty, scorchingly satirical film about movie buffs.",
            "Westby's sympathy for the Scottys of the world is evident, but like them he doesn't always know how to put his best face forward.",
            "It's through Scotty's \"success\" that writer-director James Westby is able to validate his own love for movies.",
            "Westby makes excellent use of Portland locations and cinematic references to make Film Geek a mostly spot-on, sometimes hilarious character study."

            "The film is never less than engaging, though considering that the title The Prestige refers to the moment in a magic act that gives it its \"wow\" factor, it's kind of a shame that the ultimate \"reveal\" in the movie is a little too tricky for its own good.",
            "It's quite a movie -- atmospheric, obsessive, almost satanic.",
            "The who's-bilking-whom mind games make for compelling fun, but once the presto moment of The Prestige is revealed, you're left with nothing but shattered illusions.",
            "It's a very cool piece of filmmaking -- as it has to be, given the intellectual sleight-of-hand that lies at its heart. Yet it succeeds as both great entertainment and an absorbing rumination on the dangers of playing God.",
            "Gripping, suspenseful, mysterious, moving and often darkly funny.",
            "The Prestige is a superb puzzle-box thriller.",
            "Just when viewers think they've figured things out, that's when the exquisite diversionary tactics really kick in.",
            "A leap back to his stellar Memento form, Christopher Nolan's fifth feature is an incisive work about the nature of creative obsession. The film bursts forth fully formed, richly detailed, and with a keen eye toward Nolan's usual brushstrokes",
            "The Prestige's magic is real. You just have to be looking for it.",
            "The Prestige does not impress as a magic act. It is an elaborate contraption that leaves the viewer confounded and confused, but never feeling particularly entertained or delighted by the performance.",
            "The Prestige does require a slight leap of faith, but the journey is so entertaining, it is a leap well worth taking.",
            "When you discover the secret to a magic trick, all you want is to re-watch it and see if you can spot the illusion, so too does The Prestige demand repeat viewings.",
            "Nolan's most perfect commentary on his favourite auteur theme of mise en abyme, as both magicians in their own ways make near Faustian pacts for their climactic 'prestige'.",
            "Although the film's stunning reveals make the audience realise it has been duped... there is a protagonist to empathise with each time. ",
            "While you're looking here, it's executing a trick there, and the film is, in fact, structured like a magic act with three parts called the Pledge, the Turn and the Prestige.",
            "Yes, the film is built on deceptions, and yes, it features a series of interconnected twists, but like all good movies and magic tricks, it doesn't lose any glory in a repeated performance or viewing, only gains it.",
            "Nolan has conjured a bold mix of thriller and period piece, with even a precocious dab of science fiction. ",
            "Until an inexplicably awful revelation at the end, The Prestige is a taut, exciting portrait of obsession and the dark competitive spirit of professional magicians.",
            "Risible inanity",
            "Although the slowish pacing early on over-indicates how both magicians' marquee misdirection (a disappearing act) will be achieved, The Prestige still manages a neat trick of its own.",

            "\"The Prestige\" is a cinematic trick, nothing more, and the deadpan seriousness is part of the effect, and not an end in itself.",
            "In a movie about people who make their livings on misdirection, The Prestige utterly forgets to employ its own.",
            "Nolan balances Hollywood and indie sensibilities pulling off a film that is smart, complicated and carries a big look."

            "The central subject is such a volatile, complex eccentric and his establishment is such a uniquely New York institution that the charming character study should land quality cable slots.",
            "It's a rough-hewn film, more interesting, probably, to those who've actually made it through a meal there, but fun and maybe even inspiring.",

            "Particularly valuable for its insightful and ultimately depressing portrait of political machinations.",

            "To make a movie that's so bad it's good you need vision, drive, luck and obsessive vanity. Fortuitously, The Room's writer/producer/director/star Tommy Wiseau appears to possess all of these qualities, combined with a total lack of acting talent.",
            "As someone who's watched more bad movies than you can imagine, I'm mostly immune to the so-bad-it's-good aesthetic, though I can see how, viewed in a theater at midnight after a few drinks, this might conjure up its own hilariously demented reality.",
            "The Room, has been maligned as one of the most inept movies ever made when in fact it is a sardonic comedy about sexual politics in the age of terror.",
            "Given audience reaction at screening attended, pic may be something of a first: A movie that prompts most of its viewers to ask for their money back -- before even 30 minutes have passed.",
            "Steadily grows more outrageous in its awfulness, generating countless laugh-out-loud moments.",
            "I didn't get it. Maybe because I watched it alone. This film isn't intentionally bad but it's bad.",
            "We sit there in the dark, our eyes move over flutters of passive motion, and eventually the screen goes black. That's it.",
            "The Room is pure unintentional camp. Somehow 14 years later it's still popular and is now considered a cult classic. ",
            "It is, in short, the ne plus ultra of crap. A trash masterpiece.",
            "...has what every landmark bad movie needs: total commitment.",
            "I've seen worse. ",
            "One of the only films from the whole of the 21st Century to live up to every fragment of its hype.",
            "If there is a 21st-century Edward D. Wood Jr., it is probably Tommy Wiseau.",
            "What puts \"The Room\" in a class of its own is its overabundant idiocy. While you're still gasping at one of the film's moronic lines or vagrant plot knots, another one rises up to smack you in the head. ",
            "Trust me, you've gotta check this thing out at least once, especially if you like football.",
            "A movie so bad, so inept, so unbelievably painful, it's almost impossible to comprehend anyone thought it would be great on-screen...",
            "The question becomes, How much punishment can the audience take and still keep on howling?",
            "Watching The Room is like crossing over to a counterfactual universe where the rules of film grammar and screenwriting have been written by Dan Brown.",
            "Cult-phenom amateur melodrama best left to adults.",
            "If you like bad films performed by those without talent, films like Ed Wood Jr. cranked out, then this one will do the trick.",

            "In the dynasty of dung, among the many pretenders to the best worst movie throne, Tommy Wiseau and his oddly named tragedy truly earns their rotten rep.",
            "This self-financed flick's shortcomings go way beyond the standard array of glaring continuity errors, dodgy sets and stagnant editing.",

            "De Niro deserves credit for the broad, ambitious canvas he's worked on, but his movie is just as mechanical and humourless as his protagonist.",
            "A wan, muted film that is never less than interesting, but rarely more than that either.",
            "A very dark, murky film, resentfully critical of the dysfunctional CIA family.",
            "Damon's shirts are always crisp, but he has the charisma of a perfectly groomed corpse.",
            "Infused with that glow of earnest deliberation characteristic of liberal Hollywood when focusing its well-paid talents on a worthy cause.",

            "This is one of those rare films that makes emotional as well as intellectual demands on its audience. ",
            "Robert DeNiro hasn't gotten behind the camera much -- this is only his second directing credit -- but he displays an experienced eye willing to let his actors work.",
            "Deliberately paced, but mesmerizingly so, creating a shadowy world where paranoia and deception are treated as the norm. ",
            "As a punishingly ambiguous and astonishingly thorough tragedy, \"The Good Shepherd\" shows that emotions as human as any errors can undermine intelligence and questions whether God and country alone can be enough for a man's soul.",
            "Stylistically engaging, narratively murky, historically worthless.",
            "You will probably come away from it impressed but unmoved.",
            "A isappointing hybrid that's too bloated, diffuse and tedious to work as a regular length movie -- yet has not enough emotional range or narrative focus to be considered a great epic drama.",
            "Damn near drowns itself with its unwaveringly solemn sense of importance",
            "Seems thoroughly conflicted about whether it actually buys what it's selling.",

            "A pesar de su extensa duraci\u00f3n, la pel\u00edcula no parece tener un minuto de sobra. El relato es apasionante, y est\u00e1 servido por un actor-director que ha aprendido mucho de sus maestros.",
            "In a mystery worthy of the CIA, The Good Shepherd ends up being both too long and too short.",
            "Not quite unlocking the secret history of the CIA.",
            "The Good Shepherd tells a compelling, complex, personal and political story and tells it extremely well. It's an engrossing film.",
            "Apropriadamente mergulhado em sombras e bel\u00edssimas imagens em contraluz, \u00e9 o segundo trabalho de De Niro como diretor, que revela, aqui, um olhar inspirado para composi\u00e7\u00f5es e, como j\u00e1 era de se esperar, um talento ineg\u00e1vel para a condu\u00e7\u00e3o do elenco.",

            "They're just too dull, and we start to sympathize with the women who left them both behind.",

            "Burns simply doesn't delve deeply enough into his characters for them to have sufficient emotional resonance for the viewer.",
            "Ends up being a bit erratic ... the whole thing culminating in an oddly unsatisfying conclusion",

            "No climax, no real resolution, no nothing. One can understand why it remained on a shelf since it played Tribeca over two years ago.",

            "The film doesn't quite manage to sustain interest for the duration of its 86-minute running time.",
            "Ohayon doesn't judge Thompson or his customers, but you don't need to be a Harvard-educated psychiatrist to realize that the bunch of them are dirty old men who treat women as commodities.",
            "Every moment of this story - about America's unlikeliest matchmaker -- is fascinating. We just need more of them.",
            "One would anticipate the crafting of a sinister satire here, but the film is dead serious and overidentified with Cowboy Cupid's boastful, smirking posturing. A camera in the hand of a director should be more than just a piece of surveillance equipment.",
            "The laid-back, bittersweet peek into this flourishing but little-known world will gratify and intrigue.",
            "Taking on a topic-a matchmaker of white American males with Mexican women-that both high-minded liberals and flag-toting conservatives would find offensive, Ohayon refuses to pass judgment on her subjects, instead quietly stands back and lets them talk.",
            "It's filled with humor and surprises, and no one is more surprising than Thompson himself.",
            "I think he knows very well that, at the core of his black little heart, he's basically just a joker of love -- and a danged good one at that.",

            "It's hard to get past the subject matter and judge this on its value as a documentary because the concept is truly unpleasant.",

            "Mich&#232;le Ohayon's documentary is a slyly insightful portrait of conflicting expectations in the search for the perfect partner.",
            "The movie's real subject -- remains only superficially explored.",
            "A 60-year-old eccentric with a knack for self-promotion, Thompson makes an engaging documentary subject.",
            "A well-done, oft-times entertaining documentary as it presents this unique brand of matchmaking that may or may not be the ideal situation for both parties. You be the judge.",
            "What makes Cowboy Del Amor truly a step above most of its genre is the surprising turn of events that leaves the matchmaker and match-made switching places, as their lives take ironic swings that Oyayo could only have hoped for."

            "Volver disappoints.",
            "It's up to charm to twinkle our attention away from the loose threads and daytime TV plotting.",
            "Even if Volver sounds too high-concept for you, know that Almod\u00f3var is smart enough not to rest on laughs alone, extending his premise to dark, though occasionally tidy psychological territory.",
            "It's clever and entertaining. It's marvelously deft, but never daffy. It works well enough, despite feeling like the most conventional film this great, envelope-pushing Spanish director has ever made.",
            "The film is realistic, yet Almod\u00f3var's touch of the absurd and the madcap infiltrate everything that occurs while his candy-colored visual palette lends a brightness to what in other hands might have taken the form of a sordid tale.",
            "Pedro Almod\u00f3var whipstitches a movie from patches of those mother-daughter melodramas Mildred Pierce, Bellissima and Two Women and makes it seamless and original, funny as it is fierce, breathtaking as it is life-affirming.",
            "It's a playful soap-opera, mad with colour and crazy twists. It's a ghost story that won't give you the chills. And most importantly of all, it's yet another fine movie from Spanish master Pedro Almodovar.",
            "The film never minces its words, it unabashedly confronts the challenges women everywhere face.",
            "Almod\u00f3var's tribute to mother love is overflowing with the anguish and ecstasy of life.",
            "The film is, almost by definition, deeper, more intelligent, more nuanced and more beautifully filmed than at least 95 percent of the movies coming out of Hollywood - if not more.",
            "Beautiful performances, a refreshing story, and spot-on comedic timing make this a wonderful movie.",
            "This is a woman's picture in the best sense of the term, anchored by bravura turns from Penelope Cruz and Carmen Maura. Something of a departure for the Spanish auteur, it also seals his status as a cinematic master. Never that this was much in doubt.",
            "Almod\u00f3var himself once again returning, with delicious self-consciousness, to an old plot. . . and reconfiguring it, as he does here even more radically than in his other recent films, in the subtle but provocative manner of his mature style.",
            "Almod\u00f3var's maturity navigates not only the thin lines between comedy and drama and between body and spirit, but also between rebellion and acceptance",
            "At the center of this hectic universe, [Cruz] never misses a step and may even elevate what Almodovar originally conceived.",
            "With all its unexpected twists and turns, the story still unfolds naturally, like some gaudy Mediterranean flower.",
            "Pedro Almodovar's Volver is amazingly bright, fresh and clean for a film dealing with murder, adultery, incest, malignant disease and the occasional supernatural apparition.",
            "Hollywood, take notice: If you hand Penelope Cruz a role with more depth than the paper it's printed on, this is what you'll get.",
            "Until now, you may not have considered Penelope Cruz the modern-day successor to Barbara Stanwyck and Joan Crawford. But director Pedro Almodovar's delightful 'Volver' could change your mind.",
            "...a knowing treatise on the currents that run between mothers and daughters.",
            "So how good is Spanish writer-director Pedro Almod\u00f3var's latest effort? \"Volver\" (to return) is so mesmerizingly quirky that I sat through a screening with an injured right arm writhing with pain as I became immersed in the film."

            "What a comedown, after the weirdly beautiful things Singer and his technicians did in the first two movies.",
            "While the movie takes itself seriously, not to say solemnly, it's really an occasion for funny, frightening metamorphoses and spectacular effects.",
            "The Last Stand is a hugely ambitious picture, and it would have been far more successful if Ratner had scaled it down to focus more on the interaction between the characters.",
            "All marvel and little substance.",
            "A reinvigorating return to form for the franchise after the second-episode sluggishness of X2.",
            "A loose movie, really disappointing. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "The film is successful in creating a complex moral universe, mostly due to the set-up from the previous films, but Ratner doesn't seem to know what to do with it.",
            "While X-Men: The Last Stand closes out a trilogy of stories, it leaves a sour taste...",
            "Overall, it really was disappointing, but at least it delivered some action, tidbits for the fans and a few suprises. The problem was that by the time they were done, the suprises didn't seem to mean as much as they should.",
            "Ratner keeps the focus on the big questions.",
            "X-Men: The Last Stand ends up being another -- albeit good -- comic book movie, rather than the exception to the rule that the previous films were.",
            "Under the assured, if sometimes chilly, direction of Brett Ratner, from a script by Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn (who also worked on the substandard Fantastic Four), the story here is built on different notions of loss. ",
            "The CGI is indeed magical. But watching this, I thought maybe we've seen too much magic. Maybe what we really need, even in summer action movies, isn't to see magic, but to feel emotion.",
            "A mostly fun movie, but also one not given the full emotional room to breathe that it has over the course of the trilogy earned.",
            "It's kinda lame. There's slightly more to it than that, but basically, that's what X-Men: The Last Stand boils down to.",
            "X-ecrable.",
            "It's the first halfway decent summer movie so far.",
            "Nothing really feels at stake other than box-office opening-weekend numbers",
            "Though it's not the best installment of the series, with many, many present flaws, it sure is a very entertaining film...",
            "Yes, Ratner's music-video attention span and inability to linger on a shot ... blunts the impact of some of [the] big emotional moments. Nonetheless, he liked Singer's films as much as you did, and he hasn't tried to fix what ain't broke.",
            "X-Men: The Last Stand is far from perfect, but it does manage to move in the direction of a crowd-pleasing thrill ride without completely lobotomizing itself."

            "Sadly, as with [director Eli] Roth's promising but flawed debut feature, its central conceit is more compelling than what ended up on screen.",

            "Although I spent much of the second half staring into my lap while listening to a cacophony of screams and shop tools, I processed enough of the first to appreciate Roth's sinister evocation of a Slovakian provincial town.",
            "Of the two, Hernandez offers the stronger of the performances as we watch him transformed and nearly destroyed by his captors.",
            "This is a grim, gory, and unapologetically grungy piece of \"survival horror.\" I dug it.",
            "Whereas most modern slasher films cut straight to the flesh-ripping for no purpose of art or psychological stimulation, Hostel marries them with skillful execution and, somehow, a relevant subtext.",
            "A series of interesting ideas floating around a sea of blood",
            "Roth is able to change the focus from frolicking raunchiness to extreme chilliness in a way that's quite sobering.",
            "A stern moralistic rebuke to ugly-Americanism. The movie is in-your-face but not pointlessly so.",
            "This is routine Roth as usual. Homophobia, attempted nihilism, vapid writing, paper thin plot, and nonsensical all the way...",
            "Roth proves unable to control the tone of his premise, in the end pandering too much to the male adolescent audience that he at first seems to be satirising.",
            "You are unlikely to find another contemporary American horror movie with as much intensity and style as this one.",
            "The skill with which Eli Roth has constructed his film, especially its first 40 minutes, leads me to give it the benefit of the doubt. It's creepy, gripping, horrifying stuff.",
            "While there are some cheap thrills to be had here, much of the movie is profoundly boring.",

            "To put a point to it, the lavish period costumes, operatic mise-en-sc\u00e8ne and ceremonial grandeur of Curse of the Golden Flower clashes fatally with the nuanced nastiness of modern marital discord.",
            "For all the swordplay and martial-arts fisticuffs, Curse is its most delirious as a lavish argument for the soap opera's roots in Greek tragedy.",
            "This spectacularly decorated movie offers the enjoyment of watching Zhang chronicle the lives of one very nutty family. It also allows Zhang to load every inch of the screen with images so full that you half expect them to collapse under their own weight.",
            "Curse is straightforward and solemn, lacking not for spectacle but for humor and a humanizing touch.",
            "Make no mistake, all is epic, violent, bloody madness once the director hits his stride, and fans of Zhang's work will not want to miss Curse of the Golden Flower. But brush strokes are amiss here.",
            "The melodrama here is of a sort seldom taken seriously outside Shakespeare's tragedies, and the final body count rivals Hamlet in its royal bloodletting.",
            "There's great film hidden somewhere beneath the gold plating and silk brocade. But as it stands, the film we see, while gorgeous to look at, is merely mediocre.",
            "Yi Mou does show his undeniable expertise in the spectacularly mounted warfare sequences that can rival anything you saw in the Lord of the Ring movies. The wonderfully choreographed martial arts sequences are heartstopping...",
            "Zhang Yimou serves up a sumptuous sensory feast with spectacular set pieces and--crucially--the story, characters, and connection to back it up.",
            "Zhang's beauty is one of furious defiance",
            "Um \u00e9pico que n\u00e3o apenas se encaixa no clima m\u00edtico e fant\u00e1stico do g\u00eanero wuxia pian como ainda traz toques claramente shakespeareanos em sua trama repleta de trai\u00e7\u00f5es e lutas sangrentas por um trono real (ou, neste caso, imperial).",
            "Mucho brillo y color y poca sustancia dram\u00e1tica en esta tragedia \u00e9pica que emula tanto a Shakespeare como a Kurosawa. Vale la pena s\u00f3lo por su aspecto visual y, sobre todo, por la siempre intensa Gong Li.",
            "Spectacular production designs and giant CGI battles can't really disguise a soap opera plot and often hammy acting.",
            "Curse of the Golden Flower is, as usual, ravishing to look at, but it seems to be put together solely so that Zhang can assemble hundreds of people in stately rows.",
            "Possibly the first mainstream Chinese representation of the massacre at Tiannamen Square.",
            "Curse of the Golden Flower is a tragedy in the classic sense which is as devastating as it is entertaining.",
            "Gorgeous to look at and every bit as ornate as The House of the Flying Daggers. However, the dense and complex plot is a muddle and works best when dealing with the central relationships and matters of the heart.",
            "Beautifully designed, visually stunning epic with impressive battle sequences, although the soap-tastic plot takes a while to really get going.",
            "It is an overwrought melodrama set on a background of impressive beauty.This is a beautiful film, but the characters are weak and disappointing from Zhang.",

            "This is first-rate, visceral filmmaking: taut, watchful, free of false histrionics, as observant of the fear in the young terrorists' eyes as the hysteria in the passenger cabin, and smart enough to know this material doesn't need to be sensationalized.",
            "Greengrass takes pains to keep events believable and relatively unrhetorical, rejecting entertainment for the sake of sober reflection, though one has to ask how edifying this is apart from its reduction of the standard myths.",
            "It is the film of the year. I needed to lie down in a darkened room afterwards. So will you.",
            "United 93 might be an insular response to a global tragedy, but -- taken on its own, limited terms -- it is powerful and sincere, giving reign to pity and fear without indulging jingoism or sentimentality. For that at least it deserves applause.",
            "It is emotionally raw yet unsentimental; it shows people at their most pained and inspirational; it is both brilliant and troubling.",
            "This limitation in source material has had a peculiar effect on the script. Never is there a moment of repulsive sentimentality or exploitation, but neither is Greengrass able to realize an ultimate purpose.",
            "A magnificent, superb film. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "An exquisite and respectful masterpiece that resonates with power, intensity and raw emotion, making it 2006's best film. ",
            "A well-crafted and respectful film. If only it had gone one step further in driving that point home.",
            "The film pulls you into its world, turns you a passive participant. You can feel the desperation of the passengers and as they run to the cockpit...",
            "What might be therapeutic for the families is not perhaps meant for public consumption. After all, few things are more private than the last minutes of a life.",
            "All that United 93 can tell us. . .is that many people are brave and some people are dastardly.",
            "It's a difficult and upsetting experience but a worthwhile one, which will linger in your mind long after the film ends.",
            "Above all, one truth remains: the sacrifice of the 40 passengers on Flight 93 is truly remarkable. The film portrays their courage in the face of staggering odds in its own subjective and respectful way. It achieves what it wants as a film.",
            "A black hole",
            "A flawed, but gripping well-crafted piece of drama...",
            "This is not a film you go to for enjoyment, but because you have a duty to endure it.",
            "a real-time reconstruction of events on the doomed flight that manages to encapsulate all the anxieties and sorrows of our age.",
            "I can say that United 93 has been done well -- with intelligence, compassion, efficiency -- and yet still question whether it was worth doing.",
            "A supreme achievement.",
            "Amazingly detailed in its narrative cohesion and editing, United 93 is a noble tribute to the tragedy of 9/11.",
            "Greengrass recreates the attacks on the World Trade Center utilizing existing news footage and it still retains the horror of that day. Despite knowing the ultimate outcome of this film, UNITED 93 is a harrowing and important film.",
            "Cinema verite at its very best!"

            "On the strength of their 2003 slasher flick, High Tension, Craven hired director-writer Alexandre Aja and writer Gr\u00e9gory Levasseur, and the result is one of the most exhilarating, intense, and engrossing Hollywood shockers ever made.",
            "Still not a perfect film, but it's still superior to the original.",

            "Like Craven's original, Aja's version gets the job done - it makes your stomach turn, puts you on edge, and gives you a horror-movie ride.",

            "High-minded and generous, but lacking in real passion and flair.",
            "The moral is hardly original. The scale certainly is. Only a director of Eastwood's standing could possibly terrify enough producers into financing this decidedly foreign, but impressively chunky, white elephant.",
            "Even by [Eastwood's] own high standards, Letters is an extraordinary achievement.",
            "Infinitely more compelling than its predecessor, yet equally lengthy and ill-paced.",
            "A subdued masterpiece with a unique perspective on war.",
            "In coming to understand the point of view of the opposing side, Eastwood has crafted two masterful and distinct films who are still inexorably intertwined that speak to the simple humanity in all of us. ",
            "You realize how very young many of these men were, and how ill-suited to be turned into killing machines.",
            "Modern-day echoes of being snookered into a bad war aren't lost on Clint Eastwood, and \"Letters from Iwo Jima\" delivers an overwhelmingly powerful eulogy for the death of righteousness in combat on either side of the line.",
            "Not an anti-war tract or a glorification but, rather, a fair consideration of humanity that exists within the inhumanity of armed conflict.",
            "Eastwood's cinema is one of resolutely moral images",
            "Eastwood is a master of the extended look (this comes from the two directors he acknowledges as his own masters, Sergio Leone and Don Siegel), the look that stretches time and that is blinded by what it sees.",
            "The most important film of 2006 was Clint Eastwood's Letters from Iwo Jima. In 20 years Letters from Iwo Jima will be a classic.",
            "War is hell, always has been, and movies will continue to confirm it for anyone who might doubt. In this case, though, Letters only shows that for all the different perspective the other side of a war could have, it's the same old movie clich\u00e9s.",
            "Eastwood's direction is a thing of beauty, blending unblinking ferocity with fragile delicacy.",
            "Both technical grace and an efficient ensemble smooth over some...clunky plotting.",
            "A fine, textured study of war, one that considers the strategic side as well as the human side without sacrificing either.",
            "Watching the film, I had admiration for what Eastwood and his writers were attempting, but I remained at arm's length. I'm not entirely sure why I could not buy into the film.",
            "Much as already been made about the pride and honor of the Japanese, but as a people they have rarely, if ever, been depicted as fully human characters in American war movies. It's amazing to think what Clint Eastwood has done here.",
            "... Eastwood takes this film out of the realm of a typical war picture to illuminate the boundless nature of the human spirit, which extends far beyond race and nationality.",
            "In Letters, the glossy romanticism of history crumbles before our very eyes.",
            "Eastwood has made a film that is thoughtful, poignant, touching, and philosophical. It stands as one of the best works in his long, illustrious career."

            "It takes time for the film to bounce back to the heights of its opening scene, but about midway it does.",
            "Every so often there is a hand-to-hand fight scene to cut the boredom -- the best is set atop a precipitously high wooden tower in a village square -- but even these don't set themselves apart from anything we've seen before.",
            "Jet Li movies are still pretty cool, but they appear to be heading in an unfortunate direction.",
            "It boils down to a simple but elegantly told morality tale with beautiful sets and scenery and plenty of bracing action.",
            "A movie that condemns the tendency of global culture to intrude everywhere while embracing the very things that kick multiplex doors down around the world.",
            "A bad movie that doesn't even work as entertainment. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "Part bio-pic, part wuxia, Fearless melds the best of both genres and in the process makes something greater than the sum of its parts, commenting both on its genre and human nature in general, both as they are now and what they could aspire to be.",
            "Jet Li's final fight; teens OK.",
            "A honorable send-off",
            "Every action sequence is imaginatively mounted, from a dizzying fight on a high tower, to the sight of Li taking on a wrestler twice his size...",
            "Teamed up with veteran director Ronny Yu and renowned choreographer Yuen Wo Ping, Mr. Li does some of his best work here.",
            "More of a message movie designed for mainland China than a karate chopsocky for consumption in the West where a martial arts movie has to be about butt-kicking to generate any traction.",
            "Not so much a message film as it is a martial-arts epic with a philosophical backdrop. And it is utterly sincere without being treacly or preachy.",
            "Fracassa como exemplar de artes marciais e, o que \u00e9 ainda pior, como homenagem a um homem que inspirou grandes atletas e atores (incluindo o protagonista desta produ\u00e7\u00e3o).",
            "As energetically corporeal as it is touchingly spiritual.",
            "Li carries the load on his shifty shoulders in a nostalgic wushu period piece that is philosophically solemn yet kinetically impish in its reflective spirit.",
            "Fearless has some of the best choreography I've seen in years, and Li handles the task with his usual finesse.",
            "The film is about more than complex stunts and breathtaking acrobatics. It's about a man who learns the pitfalls of pride and becomes a national hero in the process. And it's a good time at the movies.",
            "It's a treat for fans of historical martial arts epics and especially for fans of Jet Li, who won't be the ones to tell the star if he's starting to show his age.",
            "If Li must leave his signature genre, better this entertaining bit of history than the wall-to-wall boredom of Hero."

            "Fast-paced, tense and intermittently exciting, Donner's latest will keep genre fans engaged with its polished blend of tried and tested elements.",

            "Willis and Def -- funny even if he overdoes the whiny shrieking -- are a terrific team.",

            "It's a satisfying piece of genre filmmaking and an underrated American crime story...",
            "Told in nearly real-time 16 Blocks stops and starts, putting in buffers for decent character moments between Jack and Eddie. It's necessary to understand why they do what they do, but it makes what they're doing occasionally dull.",
            "16 Blocks is a good watch thanks to the performances of Bruce Willis and Mos Def. ",
            "B-movie done with shrewd aplomb",
            "At its heart, this is actually an excellent film. But, as filmmakers seek to escalate the big action, believability suffers severely.",
            "There's a fine line between old-fashioned and cliched.",
            "The most high-octane action-- pyrotechnics, fisticuffs, gunplay, car crashes, back alley dashes and fire escape leaps-- ever crammed into a pressure-cooked chase lasting less than a mile.",
            "The action is fast paced and the story throws in a couple of twists to keep you on your toes.",
            "El oficio del director Richard Donner convierte a este policial de rutina en un digno entretenimiento. Ni m\u00e1s ni menos.",
            "Willis and Def are wonderful...Donner (Lethal Weapon) unleashes a tight, effective yarn",
            "The story has been cobbled together from familiar elements; however, it arranges these elements in ways that are occasionally surprising, and in ways that accord nicely with Christian ideas about sin, repentance and redemption.",
            "Richard Donner (Superman, Lethal Weapon/s) is a respected old pro who knows how to make an action movie that delivers thrills and maybe something to chew on as well.",
            "Willis salvages what is essentially a routine thriller and elevates it to something worth watching.",
            "The movie pays off generously and just as expected.",
            "A solid, bare-knuckle action-thriller from Richard Lethal Weapon Donner that avoids most of the genre's clich\u00e9s and boasts a commendably dishevelled performance from Willis, as a washed-up NYPD flatfoot dissolving in self-loathing.",
            "It's like those cartoon chase sequences where the scrolling background is on a loop. Here, the characters are on a loop, and the backgrounds change.",
            "16 Blocks can happily sit alongside Inside Man as an example of a well-made, superbly-acted, intelligent thriller. More of these, please."

            "A triumph of high-concept but low-ambition filmmaking.",
            "There's a certain knee-jerk impulse to bash Snakes, just because of all the ridiculous buildup, but the film delivers on its promise of reptilian fun, with a camp mix of comedy, horror and suspense.",

            "A movie about snakes on a plane does not need to be straightforward; it only has a shot if it is either genuinely scary or so incredibly over the top it's funny. Snakes on a Plane is neither, but maybe Snakes on a Boat will be better.",
            "Few studio-supported films match its B-movie nirvana of stupid-goodness. It's exactly what its title suggests and more ? the proof in the primal levels ranging from basic exploited fears to the crowd?s roaring reactions and howls of humor or horror.",
            "A snarky genre exercise and its own late-night sketch parody, it parades nothing so much as the force of the public's lowered expectations",
            "Although the film's production company New Line retooled the movie from a PG-13 to an R rating with ideas and dialogue from web fans, \"Snakes On A Plane\" is a boring ride.",

            "I wonder how many more of these inspirational sports films we have to sit through in 2006.",
            "Screenwriter Brad Gann shares the guilt for this predictable cinematic travesty along with composer Mark Isham whose bombastic musical score is akin to hammering a nail with a shotgun blast.",

            "Kiddie-friendly toilet humour, a whiff of suspense and familiar voice actors make it passably entertaining, but there's little warmth or emotional satisfaction to be had from its cynical characters.",
            "Writer-director John A Davis has one or two nice touches, but the film is disposable.",
            "Just another bug movie.",
            "... unnecessary ...",
            "... The Ant Bully is just a great ride, but all that moralizing diminishes the fun of feeling ant-sized yourself and being immersed in Lucas's incredible adventures.",
            "If the Ant Bully story is generic, it is never plodding. It zips along quite nicely, aided by the especially well-constructed action sequences.",
            "It is hard not to be troubled by a film that seems obsessed with teaching about community and friendship, but ends up preaching more about conformity and self-sacrifice. ",
            "Hollywood animation can be boringly formulaic. And this one is all about some self-righteous moralising.",
            "Cute animated movie with a message for kids.",
            "It's a fun adventure fantasy, and I was never bored...",
            "While the animation, particularly in the action set pieces, is indeed well done, it's nothing revolutionary nor imaginative that stands out from the rest in this CG-feature-a-week marketplace.",
            "Isn't clever or inventive enough to make up for its repetitive and lackluster storytelling.",
            "One of those animated features you can enjoy even without a kid by your side.",
            "It's imaginative and amusing with its engaging characters and nicely crafted animation, even though the ants themselves are visually the least interesting ... Uplifting and bright. ",
            "Ten year old Lucas Nickle ( the voice of Zach Tyler Eisen) stomps an anthill after an encounter with neighborhood bullies. With the help of a magic potion, the ants shrink the boy down to their size. The insects are about to get even and Lucas will learn",
            "...this visually arresting story of a young geek's friendship with some enterprising ants isn't as compelling in the script department.",
            "The film acknowledges that faith is an important part of our social fabric, and if the film has any moral lessons to pass on, it implicitly roots them in a spiritual foundation.",
            "The new computer-animated movie, \"The Ant Bully,\" knows a few things about bullies, most of which we already know--all of which bear repeating.",
            "Even without too much sentimentality, and without any musical numbers, this is a fun-filled animated masterpiece that should only be seen in 3-D and on a 70-foot screen.",
            "Besides keeping us entertained and occasionally thrilled, there's a nice sense that the film is actually saying something.",
            "Enjoyable, brightly animated adventure with strong characters, superb gags and a script that isn't afraid to throw in a spot of political subtext."

            "The actors and the filmmakers all take a more restrained approach than you might expect, keeping the humor gentle, and the jokes mostly as literary as the premise.",
            "An uncommonly plastic bit of Hallmark sentiment-mongering, with exactly the kind of New Age psychobabble ending you\u00e2(TM)d expect.",
            "Ferrell rules in this film. I take back my words of prejudice. This is the smartest film in town.",
            "Screenwriter Zach Helm's comedy has some quirky points, but it's very sugary and sentimental, and feeble compared to the work of those who have done the same sort of thing better: Woody Allen or Charlie Kaufman.",
            "Instead of finishing with a bang it peters out, but this existential yarn is still fresh and funny enough to justify taking two hours out of your life.",
            "A film well worth seeing and savoring.",
            "Helm's strong script is aided by superb direction from Marc Forster and a top-notch cast.",
            "The manic spirit of Preston Sturges has a hold of this voyage of self-discovery that's packed with laughs and brilliant performances. Thompson in particular hasn't been this inspired for a long time.",
            "There just isn't enough wit or style or verve to pull it off. It takes a great premise and then not only fails to run with it, but also fails to go absolutely anywhere with it at all.",
            "\"It's not the best piece of English literature of the last ten years,\" Dustin Hoffman says of Emma Thompson's newest novel, \"but it's not bad.\" That just about sums up Stranger Than Fiction, too.",
            "Touching dramedy is heavy; won't interest most kids.",
            "Inventively inverting \"Adaptation.'s'\" anxiety into light romance, \"Fiction\" is one of the most intelligent, lively, charming and beguiling concept comedies since \"Groundhog Day\" and a perfect seriocomic splinter of Will Ferrell's big-baby shtick.",
            "\"Stranger Than Fiction\" is a sterile and pedantic comedy that tells much more than it shows.",
            "Suggests how cleverness can suffocate people",
            "Forster lards over his whimsically feeble film with sentimentality.",
            "Some of Will Ferrell's biggest fans might find it overly tame and subtle, but it's interesting, enjoyable and a revelation to see he can keep his pants on and still entertain.",
            "It could have been great. But it's just okay.",
            "What starts out as a complex, intriguing movie turns stale quickly.",
            "The movie\u00e2(TM)s unforgivable logical flaws and gummy platitudes don\u00e2(TM)t sink it...thanks to Ferrell\u00e2(TM)s fine and humane performance.",
            "Stranger Than Fiction is not a fluff film. Far from it. Literate and engaging, it may parade around in nonsensical clothes, but just scratch the surface and a vast reservoir of post-modern existentialism is revealed.",
            "The place where the film runs into problems is in trying to decide, like Harold, as to whether or not it is a comedy or a tragedy. As we know, comedy sells much better and that's the direction the film leans.",
            "Though there are enough interesting moments to keep it refreshing, Mr. Helm's script never rises above its conceit to reach the giddy Charlie Kaufman heights to which it aspires.",
            "A literate, literary film with a Hollywood high-concept hitch.",
            "No es ni una comedia, ni una tragedia, ni una historia de amor, ni una f\u00e1bula. Es ni m\u00e1s ni menos que una idea original mal desarrollada, que no entretiene lo suficiente y que conduce a ninguna parte."
