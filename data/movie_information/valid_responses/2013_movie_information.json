            "When Marvel brought in Alan Taylor, the director of Game of Thrones, to invigorate the Thor franchise, many hoped for a breast-bearing, dwarf-battling, blood-spurting melodrama -- with capes and hammers. Sadly, it was not to be. ",
            "[Director Alan Taylor] is helped by Tom Hiddleston's sleekly malevolent performance as Thor's untrustworthy brother Loki, a more engaging and complex figure than Chris Hemsworth's monosyllabic Thor.",
            "Comic-book superheroes have become so angst-ridden in recent years it's a relief to be around one who has hung on to his sense of humour.",
            "Thor: The Dark World is a good model of how superheroes can save the world without forced gravitas, and have fun doing it.",
            "Enough with the appetite-whetting experiments. Just wake me when The Avengers: Age of Ultron is here.",
            "A wildly uneven but entertaining sequel to one of Marvel Comics' most enduring franchises.",
            "It's also a film more grounded in emotion even amidst a serious amping up of the action that one might expect and hope for from a superhero film.",
            "A goofy, clunky film more interested in fitting with the rest of the Marvel Universe than in telling its own fully developed story.",
            "To give Marvel credit, even though the formula is basic, they remain incredibly consistent.",
            "A far more entertaining and superior film to the first Thor. It keeps my interest throughout, has great humour, great characters, great set-pieces, some stunning visuals - what more could you ask for?",
            "Thor: The Dark World, allows for a certain broadening of horizons, bringing in magic and mythology, whilel keeping a distinct sci-fi edge.",
            "The biggest problem with the movie is that it's boring.",
            "It looked cheap.",
            "...when it's all said and done, Thor: The Dark World deserves its reputation as the worst MCU movie.",
            "Its various subplots are connected not by theme or by character, but by coincidence. It has the appearance of well-structured drama, but it leaves too many elements hanging in mid-air to form a coherent whole.",
            "Regardless of the numerous plot twists, there are brilliant jokes and great fights, Thor: The Dark World is a fitting sequel for post-Avengers action.",
            "Overall, the script may be sloppy and the tone may fluctuate but darn if Thor: The Dark World ain't the fantasy/sci-fi, slapstick, action-packed, bizarre romp you never knew you kinda wanted.",
            "All the audience needs is Thor and Loki together onscreen to make the trip an absolute joy and more than worth it.",
            "There's a real absence of mystique and depth as hit-and-miss jokes/sidekicks dominate, leaving the viewer pining for the subtler notes from its predecessor - or even from Iron Man 3.",
            "Thor: the Dark World is probably the worst Marvel movie",
            "Thor: The Dark World certainly has its moments but it is far from perfect.",
            "It's a visual spectacle with some flair that is nearly as fun as the snappy screenplay.",
            "Loki is the only character who makes himself new and interesting. When he is around, Thor: The Dark World becomes a different film altogether. You wish there was more of him. The rest of it is metal clanking.",
            "It's only when the scenery-chewing Loki enters the fray that this sequel really comes alive, with Hiddleston effortlessly swinging from comedy to villainy and back again. "

            "A smartly made, highly entertaining ride, laced with a strange poignancy that makes it an all-around wonderful movie experience.",

            "Imagine, if you will, the great white shark from Jaws clambering out of the water and attacking people on land, and you'll have some sense of what makes Bong Joon-ho's film The Host so terrifying.",
            "A livid bureaucratic satire, berserk creature feature and surprisingly somber drama, \"The Host\" is a convulsive, wild ride - simultaneously eliciting squirms and giggles by mashing up finger-pointing anger with \"The Thing's\" wiseass wickedness.",
            "A pleasant reminder of the pleasures in the low-budget quickly made monster B-film of the 1950s.",

            "Its pedigree may seem like a trump card, but make no mistake -- Runner Runner is bluffing.",
            "Five years from now, I can see this movie constantly slotted on networks like USA and TNT to fill the programming gaps.",
            "Justin Timberlake can not carry a movie on his own and this one sinks under his efforts. Still the plot of the movie is pretty much run of the mill in its own right",

            "Limp pacing and countless shots of Washington's skyline plague the narrative.",

            "There are many problems with the opening two-thirds of Temptation; an infinity of problems. But the biggest is that it's immoderately boring.",
            "Perry accurately points out how, when a marriage gets dull, you don't actually need a rich, intense playboy (Robbie Jones) who reveals himself to be Lucifer incarnate to speed up the \"till death do us part\" process.",

            "[Perry's] characters, if they could speak outside of his universe, would do nothing but scream in agony as life crushes them in its God-shaped vise of moral consequence. And that is awesome to watch.",

            "A present-day parable preaching to the choir with sobering warnings about taking your mate for granted and the love of money as the root of all evil. The Gospel according to Tyler Perry!",
            "When its third act erupts into full-blown theatrical maximalism, Tyler Perry's Temptation practically turns into Brian De Palma's Temptation.",
            "It isn't until Temptation grows flamboyantly bad in its final act that it rises to the level of good dumb fun in the trashy tradition of Perry's most entertainingly awful films.",
            "A few wild, third-act twists give Perry's middling melodrama some soap-opera kick. But all the finger-wagging sure does get tiring after a while.",
            "Perry's ongoing disinterest in improving as a filmmaker is now seemingly part of his unshakable belief in himself, his insistence on doing his thing his way."

            "Softer and schmaltzier than the original. Vince Vaughn has played this guy before, to better effect.",
            "The real pity here is that Vince Vaughn actually does stretch himself a bit and is mostly successful at doing so.",
            "It is a clever-ish premise that is not placed under pressure to generate too many dumb chuckles for the sake of it.",
            "[Delivery Man] falls short of being more than schmaltzy. The plot is incredulous and predictable in places.",

            "Delivery Man's failure lies in the gulf between the two films it's trying to be. Certain moments feel like leftovers from a more serious-minded picture... The rest of the film is pleasantly inconsequential, but these lapses in tone sour the picture.",
            "The plot is quite thin, but the movie is winning because David is a screw-up but his heart is in the right place.",
            "Gooey sentimentality and group hugs follow, but Vaughn is not entirely unappealing.",
            "Delivery Man, for all of its rough edges, ultimately seeks to celebrate the family relationship, even if it isn't a movie for the whole family.",
            "Based on 2011's movie, Starbuck, this is Vaughn's vehicle all the way. All said and done, the movie has its heart in the right place.",
            "A sentimental exploration of what fatherhood means that doesn't overdo it with the sperm gags, it's a rather charming if unexceptional dramedy.",
            "While the story drags at times, Delivery Man is smart, funny, fresh and full of heart.",
            "Vaughn fans will find enough laughs to justify the two hours, but the tonal issues will make it a hard sell for anyone else.",
            "Stiff but tolerable.",
            "Delivery Man has a beginning, a middle and an end. And, for modern Hollywood, a pertinent everyman story to tell, too.",
            "The sheer cognitive dissonance between being told that this character is nice and the baffling deception he pulls on hundreds of people is agonizing, and it makes the story horribly anti-dramatic.",
            "'Delivery Man' is a little like the main character: just good enough to make you care a little and smile a lot.",
            "Delivery Man starts off strong, but gradually fades into mediocrity courtesy of, well, just too much going on.",
            "While those simple oversights may prevent the movie from achieving perfection, they rarely undermine its earnest endeavor to explore shifting family dynamics and their impact on our ability to connect with others."

            "A maniacally muddled and maudlin thriller, co-written and produced by Sly Stallone.",
            "Fleder - a dab hand with knotty, workable pulp - proves admirably patient in revealing character and place, and it helps that those laying siege to our hero's self-timbered abode never quite react in the way expected of goons in a Jason Statham movie.",
            "Homefront does nothing to stretch its leading man, but there's something to be said for Statham's stardom and the films being slotted around it - like a stubborn bollard, you always know exactly where to find him.",
            "The screenplay for this violent retro schlock was written by Sylvester Stallone, and the movie feels like something out of the early eighties.",
            "Aside from a puzzling name, this is a movie with no pretention, that isn't trying to be anything that it isn't. \"Homefront\" is an action movie from an earlier generation, and if that sounds like a good time, this is a movie that you'll probably like.",
            "As much heart-pounding action as heart-stopping emotion,  brings it home with action and heart.",
            "Unfortunately, this formulaic retro action throwback doesn't deliver on any front. All the B-movie tropes are plentifully applied, but none have the gleeful absurdity and guilty satisfaction of Stallone's beat 'em ups or Statham's own Crank cycle. ",
            "While it doesn't add anything to the aforementioned action subgenre, Statham's physicality and Stallone's old school plot maintain the standard and audience interest.",
            "Sylvester Stallone writes a script that's aimed at cramming as many testosterone-fueled confrontations as possible without giving the film a backbone to hold it up when it falters.",
            "Gary Fleder's direction and Sylvester Stallone's script is at best sloppy like that and at worst downright offensive. ",
            "... a summation of action scenes, almost without rhyme or reason. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Homefront makes a familiar scenario fresh, propelled by Jason Statham's Phil Broker.",
            "What sets the movie apart is the performance of Franco. His turn as Gator elevates the affair.",
            "Homefront manages to hit all the right notes and even a few you wouldn't expect, and there's nothing expendable about that.",
            "Statham is not the English Clint Eastwood yet, but if someone fancied calling him Dirty Jason... who knows?",
            "Homefront is as gleefully dumb and thoroughly entertaining.",
            "Oh, and did I mention that Sylvester Stallone adapted the screenplay for this from a novel? Because that.",
            "When Jason Statham stops to pat a kitten after MacGyvering up the bad guy's meth-lab to explode when the lights are switched on, you will either groan or giggle... if you are inclined towards the latter you may find quite a bit of enjoyment in Homefront.",
            "The climax is a muddle and borderline preachy",
            "[Blu-ray Review] Dynamically directed, legitimately suspenseful as the climax plays out, and consistently captivating for all 102 minutes.",
            "Predictable but well enough made to hold something for fans of The Stath.",
            "Director Gary Fleder gets into the rubbishy mood with ease, and there's an appealing if undisciplined generosity about the inclusion of supporting players"

            "As compelling as Pitt is at reflecting the world's pain through Lane's eyes, the movie treats him too often as if he truly is the only one with loved ones to lose or a world to save.",

            "World War Z didn't need to be a splatter-fest, but for the genre, it seems over-sanitized.",
            "Bottom line, it's pretty entertaining as a summer flick, but it's hard to take seriously, and if you're a true zombie fan, you may be disappointed.",
            "World War Z adds some good ideas to a genre that really needs them, but fails to make me really care about what's going on. ",
            "As the conclusion demonstrates, this isn't a hard-core zombie picture. But it's passable by even those standards, using the ticking clock action to balance the lack of traditional gore.",
            "Zombie movies require a certain amount of weirdness or subversiveness to succeed. Turning a zombie pandemic into a generic disaster movie robs the zombies of their dirty, nasty edginess and robs the disaster of its epic scope.",
            "Much less bloody (though, of course, not bloodless and peppered with mild profanity) and much more cerebral than typical horror fare, the Pitt-produced apocalyptic thriller comes about as close as one can to a heart-warming zombie film.",
            "I don't know how else to put it -- it's bad. It's a mess. It's barely functional as a piece of entertainment and not at all as a movie.",
            "While the 3D effect helped increase the intensity of the film, I can only hope a sequel will fill in some of the story that is dangling in some areas."

            "Something about it reminds you of the sequence from the original Rocky film in which Stallone spars with a side of beef, except with Stallone replaced by a second side of beef, and the first side of beef fighting back.",
            "By the time Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro start training for the big match -- it's called Grudgment Day -- you give in because, surprisingly, both actors have reported for duty, especially De Niro.",

            "Really? Did this actually look good on paper? Or was the money just so awesome that it was impossible to pass up? ",
            "Grudge Match pulls no punches. A trip down memory lane for many of us, a fun-filled often tongue-in-cheek nod to cinema legends, it wins every round. Ding, Ding!",
            "Muhammad Ali may have had the ability to float like a butterfly and sting like a bee, but 2013's Grudge Match can do no more than stumble around like a cockroach that's taken a direct hit from a can of Raid.",

            " I don't want to sound like some butthurt feminist here, but if a Mike Tyson cameo is the least misogynistic part of your movie, you have a problem.",
            "Grudge Match becomes less a celebration of the real and fictional characters from boxing past (La Motta was a real person) and more a critique of society's bloodlust.",
            "A botched high-concept premise, Grudge Match wallows in the sentimentality that seems to be an integral part of too many boxing movies.",

            "I do have to marvel at the way Stallone has always been able to make himself the underdog. This is a massive monster of a man who should by any account be the Goliath to any movie's David, yet he's always able to play vulnerable.",
            "Grudge Match is one of those ideas that works as a passing joke rather than an actual film, but the film's brazenness is admirable, and it is possible to have a good time with it. Just make sure your expectations are suitably lowered first.",
            "This film is clearly designed as a comedy as opposed to a drama. A few jokes will put a smile on your face but there's not enough to warrant a \"must see\" recommendation."

            "The opening scene of Jobs, the feeble biopic of the iconic Apple founder, is the one that keeps recurring throughout the film, with varying degrees of hagiographical worship, which is never less than lofty.",
            "It's just insightful enough, albeit briefly, to be worth your time.",

            "Aside from a trio of witches that can hold its own with Eastwick's in the dishiness department, Oz the Great and Powerful is a peculiarly joyless occasion. ",
            "Let us take a moment to praise two great and surprisingly powerful characters: a winged monkey and a wee girl made out of china. Because so much human wonder resides in these two creations of make-up, puppetry, digital effects and lovely performances.",
            "Franco kinda sorta captures the swindler side of Oz quite convincingly, but he never manages to humanize the character.",
            "Oz's journey to become The Man Behind The Curtain is a fun and surprisingly touching experience.",
            "Though slick and visibly appealing, this is empty, vapid, and could have been so much more. ",
            "Sam Raimi wearily pays a tribute to all the adaptations of The Wizard of Oz, but at the same time leaves us floating in the air - with a flying broomstick - by showing a poor story, lacking in consistency. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "One wonders what L. Frank Baum would think of movies like Oz the Great and Powerful. He'd appreciate the technical innovations of modern cinema, most likely. But I doubt that he'd appreciate how his characters have been \"updated.\"",

            "Weighing in at 130 minutes, Oz the Great and Powerful is as cumbersome and overwrought as its title.",
            "The studio that hinges on creating magical family entertainment seems to have forgotten that magic, contrary to popular belief, is not created by adhering to formula.",
            "There's not enough to make a new classic to match the old. This movie may be mildly diverting, but for that you'll have to keep looking somewhere over the rainbow. It ain't here.",
            "There's not an honest, human moment in the entire film. ",
            "For every positive spin -- the visual flare, a really good supporting cast, interesting back stories - the film can't overcome its one fatal flaw. That flaw is James Franco... . He looks completely disinterested and out of place.",
            "Predictable, burdened with unfunny dialogue and stilted performances, and insulting to its audience and its source material, this Oz is anything but great.",
            "Against all the odds, Oz The Great and Powerful emanates a timeless magic which should hopefully entertain audience just as Judy Garland and her ruby slippers continue to do.",
            "Overall, Oz the Great and Powerful is good and effective. It could be better, but it feels like part of the Oz most of us know and love, and that fact lives up to the \"Great\" in the title. ",
            "Tries mightily to determine precisely what kind of story it wants to be -- a romp or an adventure -- and doesn't quite land at either. ",
            "Wizard of Oz may be a movie originally made for kids, but Oz: The Great and Powerful is a magical spectacle and story enjoyable for all ages.",
            "The problem of Oz is not the debt it owes to previous storytellers. It's one thing to remake, or reimagine, a fairy tale. It's quite another to trade in the tired tropes of centuries."

            "Cold exteriors and warm interiors combine in the Coen brothers' rhapsodic portrait of a '60s folk singer.",

            "The broad, black humor of the Coens' early features has ripened over the years into a sadder, more philosophical brand of comedy (A Serious Man) that puts them in a class with Billy Wilder and Ernst Lubitsch (yeah, you heard me).",
            "The Coen brothers have crafted another unique period piece. ",
            "Isaac and the Coen brothers have imparted their character with no shortage flaws, but he should be immensely empathetic for anyone who's ever attempted to carve out their own place in the overwhelmingly world of music. ",
            "The film will appeal to true Coen purists.",
            "Out of all the Coen Brothers' films, Inside Llewyn Davis has to be their most heartfelt and sentimental film I've watched.",
            "Even with Oscar Isaac's good performance, it doesn't have the energy or dynamism that characterizes the Coens' style. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Goofy plot digressions and a Kerouac-worthy subplot deliver the season's most original comedy/drama...",

            "The Coen Brothers do create one of their most complex characters in Llewyn Davis.",
            "Inside Llewlyn Davis looks and sounds fantastic, but the indecisive performances from its cast and the aimless story isn't enough to captivate this reviewer.",
            "[A] remarkable film that is both amusing character study and profound treatise about unrealised ambition, the cruel nature of fate and the omnipresent possibility of failure.",
            "Elegiac yet hilarious, beautiful yet melancholy, Inside Llewyn Davis is one of the Coens' finest films to date.",
            "Perhaps the most infuriating thing about Inside Llewyn Davis is how rabidly (and anachronistically) apolitical it is.",
            "The Coen brothers are nonpareil pastiche artists, capable of burrowing deeply enough into the cultural gestalt of particular moments of twentieth-century America to render a facsimile that feels right without being slavish.",
            "Featuring a breakthrough lead turn from Oscar Isaac as a struggling folk singer, the Coens have returned to the high watermark of such classic efforts as Miller's Crossing and Barton Fink.",
            "... a lot of emotional turmoil for a movie where not a lot actually happens, which is where the Coen magic kicks in.",
            "The film is full of the typical Coen wit and style, and also features a brilliant soundtrack and strong work from Isaac.",
            "It's a slice-of-life film featuring wonderful folk compositions... and Oscar Isaacs, as Llewyn, takes the starring opportunity and runs with it.",
            "It is ultimately a film about much life can suck when you try to follow a dream, enough to the point it can make that dream seem undesirable, yet the path remains inescapable.",
            "A few films have also capitalized on this tradition, but Inside Llewyn Davis may be one of the most captivating with a first-rate soundtrack and fascinating though somber narrative."

            "Wholeheartedly succeeding where recent comparable American independent efforts have failed, Nichols' triumphant backwater bromance offers everything you could want from a film of its ilk. ",
            "The southern fried comforts and sleepy-eyed momentum of Mud instills Nichols's first-rate fable with the hearty flourishes of gothic grandstanding that resonates so eloquently..[a] special occasion where it pays off to roll around in this Mud patch ",
            "With a lack of sentimentality, the appealingly naturalistic performances of the two boys and a slow-burn build-up to an explosive finale, it's a charming, redolent and unexpected pastoral that both intrigues and moves.",
            "Mud feels thoroughly, depressingly familiar in nearly every one of its narrative, thematic, and dramatic beats, even if one can't place a precise predecessor.",
            "McConaughey gives his best performance since Killer Joe, while Sheridan, whom we first saw in Terrence Malick's The Tree Of Life, is faultless as Ellis.",

            "What a treat for the eyes and the ears.",
            "Mud has a stellar cast. Nichols knows they'll do the heavy lifting for him, and his nuanced direction and thoughtful visuals lets them do exactly that.",
            "A Huckleberry Finn-type tale with edges, Mud is an adolescent adventure that should charm adults.",

            "Nebraska is an absolutely enchanting film, so funny, so touching, ringing true - for me right up there with the year's best.",
            "A bittersweet road movie about the joy and sadness of ageing directed by the great Alexander Payne.",

            "Alexander Payne has crafted a film that doesn't feel like a film.",
            "Despite its shortcomings, Nebraska offers much to grant it a strong recommendation, mainly for Payne's largely mature and unflinching look at the dusty underside of the American Dream.",
            "The plot of this is really simple yet believable, making it easy to care about the situation - all of which is made better by the subtle performances of its cast.",
            "Nebraska is Payne's fourth consecutive \"reflections on an average white male life while on the road\" film. ",
            "It droops in the middle and veers off into sticky sentimentality by its third act, but Nebraska is still able to retain a solid charm.",
            "Nebraska is a bleak view of contemporary America but also a loving one.",
            "I went into Nebraska, hopeful but cautious. But in this film [Alexander] Payne seems to be going not sideways, but backwards.",
            "An authentic pathos is extracted with great skill from in between the constant jabbing notation of gesture and attitude and manners; which is to say that Payne seems a true comic artist of the oldest and most deadly serious kind.",
            "A deeply personal, emotionally resonant and -- let's not forget -- richly entertaining road movie with several award-worthy performances.",
            "Nebraska is a slow-burning heart-warmer that neatly dodges the cornball bullet of a climactic manly hug. ",
            "Squibb's performance is the perfect way to sum up the film: This movie could easily have been overly sentimental, but instead has a refreshing amount of honesty that makes it memorable.",
            "No splashy, sentimental performances. No outrageous plot twists. No CGI. Just regular folks reckoning with their circumstances, quietly, with dignity, and suffused with director Alexander Payne's signature dry wit.",
            "One of the most pictorially concentric American films of recent years.",
            "Nebraska lacks the sourness that permeates the likes of Sideways and The Descendants, trading it in for straight deadpan, to better and more lasting effect. This is a terrific movie.",
            "What is interesting about Nebraska is its feel, staged more like a play than a movie, which should leave fans of Payne's pleasantly surprised.",
            "Overall, the film is as gray and hopeless as the landscape.",
            "The story is simple but perfectly executed, the cast all provide stellar work, and the film's message about family and dreams is wonderfully poignant.",
            "The movie's final act may be too sentimental for fans of Payne's satire, but that's what worked for me."

            "Wolverine's backstory was good stuff -- but after the falling out with Schreiber, the story loses its center and it gets wobbly.",
            "I was definitely disappointed.",
            "Alas, there's nothing quite memorable here: much of the combat is just a whirl of movement photographed up close. As the X-Men series has progressed, the startling poetic extravagances of the first film have given way to flesh-pounding clumsiness.",
            "Even when the hand-to-hand combat looks impressive, the stunts get far-fetched, pushing the special effects to the limit.",
            "Emphatically overblown. Slightly underwhelming. Intermittently exciting. Consistently confusing.",

            "There's plenty of brawn and brute force to go around of course, but it lacks the heart and soul that distinguished the franchise.",
            "Wolverine is as visually enticing as films get, but it still feels soulless. Just like in the funny books, pyrotechnics is no substitute for a well-told yarn.",
            "Wolverine starts with a roar before sliding into a chaotic, preachy mess.",
            "This one is dull, lifeless, and maddeningly transparent.",
            "It's nearly joyless in its badness - unlike some Z-movies that revel in their badness, Wolverine thinks it's a great film.",
            "There's little here to get the pulse racing. For a summer blockbuster, that's disappointing. For a Wolverine film, that's pretty hard to forgive.",
            "No matter how well-staged, the action doesn't make much sense, and the story is a tedious muddle.",
            "So much for a clean slate. ",
            "Adequate",
            "Straight off the bat: this movie features more shots of muscle-bound men looking up at the camera and yelling \"RAAWWWRGH!\" than any other I can remember. It's the shoutiest film of the year.",

            "Unfortunately, the special effects vary from impressive to embarrassing, and some additional trimming at the story level might have helped elevate the metallurgical rating to steel status."

            "The themes are important, even if in this Hollywood laundering they are sloshed about in love suds and clattered by uneven comedy spins.",
            "If Admission had become an edgier film, I have a strange feeling that we'd be watching yet another really great Tina Fey comedy.",
            "Despite the formulaic structure-every character is a type, paired off with his or her textbook opposite-there's a whiff of inside-baseball realism to the its detailed portrait of the university admissions process...",
            "Admission has some funny moments and it has some poignant moments. Unfortunately, the film never seems quite able to determine what its focus should be. This results in a movie that never quite clicks.",
            "While Rudd and Fey may not have the most fiery on-screen chemistry, they're always enjoyable to watch. I'd call this one a rainy-day rental.",
            "Tina Fey and Paul Rudd are Hollywood's comedy sweethearts... But while the film gets high scores, it's not passing with flying colors.",
            "It pains me to lay this problem at the feet of the leads, of whom I am, independently, quite fond. They are both likeable, and I'll even grant them some chemistry, but their characters' situations become too serious for the performances they deliver.",
            "Portia is in many ways a typical [Tina] Fey character but the unfunny and clich\u00e9d script too often reminds us this is no 30 Rock.",
            "Because all these narrative threads are presented with equal emphasis, no single one feels fully developed. And Fey and Rudd's screen time together is rushed; audiences don't get the chance to become invested in their characters.",
            "Admission fizzles out to an almost aggressive extent and finally does conclude on as anticlimactic a note as one could envision...",
            "It is neither a broad comedy nor a dopey rom-com; it's actually, surprisingly enough, a seriocomic drama in something resembling the Alexander Payne mold, a slightly eccentric examination of flawed people doing their very best.",
            "Photographed in fifty shades of beige, Admission is the blandest film I've seen in months.",
            "A romantic dramedy about a passionate erudite oddball woman with her own life? Hooray!",
            "What's a romantic comedy to do when it is neither romantic nor comedic? When that film is Admission, it plunges forward drunkenly, hoping to overcome its inadequacies with goodwill created by the cast.",
            "Overstays its welcome before petering out unremarkably.",
            "An engaging cast holds our interest even when this rom-com meanders down unnecessary sideroads and dips into corny sentimentality.",

            "Shot on location in New York, Dead Man Down strives, successfully, for the gritty v\u00e9rit\u00e9 look of '70s American cinema. And the city emerges as a character in a way we rarely see today.",
            "At first a seemingly Hitchcockian scenario with echoes of Rear Window, the film swiftly swirls into a flashy revenge drama wearing redemption on its sleeve, for mostly enjoyable effect.",

            "An innocuous, unappealing and in the end an absurdly violent revenge gangster film.",
            "Not all of it hits its mark, but when the picture starts to gain momentum at the hour mark, its distinctiveness sets in. And it's almost startling.",
            "The cast does all that they can, but, by the end, Dead Man Down plays as a confused, noble misfire.",
            "It gives us no real themes to marinate upon, yet it gives us very little memorable action in which to revel. It's simply a mish-mosh and a shame.",
            "The plot and characters of pulpy revenge thriller Dead Man Down are pure B-movie stuff, yet stars Colin Farrell and Noomi Rapace lend the film unexpected class and conviction. ",
            "While Dead Man Down has a talented cast in Farrell, Rapace, and Howard, it ends up being a rather bland take on the revenge thriller, offering nothing new or stimulating to the genre.",
            "It's more American nightmare than any manner of dream.",
            "Dead Man Down is Oplev demonstrating the same great cinematic sense he did with Millenium Series, and that revenge is never a straight line, it's a thorny bramble.",

            "A completely absurd tongue-in-cheek action film that evenly distributes the laughs and the body count",
            "The cameos are distracting, the plot loses its rhythm before disintegrating completely and the seemingly endless decapitations and brutal deaths will lead even the most hardened of action fans to seek religion after the credits roll.",

            "Hollywood legend Redford holds our attention singlehandedly and though it is only him and the sea, the suspense never flags.",
            " Redford delivers a tour de force performance to ensure this beautifully simple idea enthralls throughout.",
            "This is a glorious piece of cinema that revels in the core values of silent film, a tale of man versus nature that speaks to the heart rather than the mind.",
            "This is a brilliant film with an intense and engrossing plot and an actor who does justice to his extraordinarily demanding role.",
            "All Is Lost's grandiose portrait of honour in struggle is a lucid and indomitable celebration of the endurance of the human spirit that makes for one hell of a ride.",
            "Unlike similar films, Zemeckis' Cast Away and Cuar\u00f3n's Gravity, which wrapped up in their contingencies familiarly sentimental undertones, Chandor keeps it pared down and real",
            "All Is Lost can be tedious to watch at times but its metaphoric overtones about crisis-driven alienation and determination will certainly float one's boat.",
            "In any event, the film is a subtle acting exercise and a triumph of cinematography; it is also a tad ho-hum.",
            "It is a bold and masterful film, and Redford is great.",
            "Its lack of detail and substance might be aggravating to some viewers, but the blank palette puts you in a position to run free with your own interpretation, and I have a tough time believing that wasn't director J.C. Chandor's intention all along.",
            "There's almost no dialogue and yet it grips from damp beginning to seriously watery end.",
            "Powerful. ",
            "Even with the boring bits, it's a solid A of a movie, a top-tenner for sure.",
            "All Is Lost is a testament to the possibilities of digital cinema: a film like this, shot in such close confines, simply couldn't be made with anything other than lightweight, handheld cameras. ",
            "As grim and hopeless as things could possibly get in a movie called All Is Lost, the movie is essentially about perseverance: playing it smart, staying safe and not giving up until -- well, see the title."

            "It delivers the promised dose of sentimental inspiration and is then quickly forgotten, leaving little trace behind with viewers.",
            "It's not a terrible film -- a crowd-pleaser, a toe-tapper, with appealing, sympathetic leads, it's no worse than anything else Frankel's made of late.",
            "As sweet as the story is -- and as charming as James Corden is in the lead role -- it's mostly a safe, forgettable film steeped in a by-the-numbers blandness.",
            " The film trades in the hoariest of bio-pic cliches, but the music and Corden's performance can't be beat. ",
            "Sweet, sentimental biopic of British talent show winner.",

            "...all about perseverance against daunting odds and proving naysayers wrong while remaining cute and cuddly",
            "The film is, indeed, a bit pat. Sweet and funny - largely thanks to James Corden in the lead role - it's never particularly surprising.",
            "More of a commercial than an authentic inspection of a man's life.",
            "It's a film that swears by the golden formula of crowd-pleasing sentimentality: Let viewers laugh at the struggles and share in the triumphs.",
            "\"Billy Elliot\" fans will likely adore this tale of a sensitive lad misunderstood by his macho dad. Everyone else will find it tepid.",

            "The opening scenes are filled with stop-motion animation, a mouse blowing soap bubbles and other delights; later episodes are dark and ashen. The effect is that of Pee-wee's Playhouse slowly sinking into the dank tarn that claimed Poe's House of Usher. ",
            "Mood Indigo is, by any sane criteria, a quixotic, even ill-advised folly. There's a certain overexertion to it all-like Terry Gilliam, Gondry is always compelled to push things that little bit harder when you wish they'd been handled lightly. ",
            "At a time when so much filmmaking is marked by rampant laziness, it's both refreshing and a little daunting to encounter a film of such nonstop invention and creativity as Mood Indigo. ",

            "The slapstick is often clunky, but Robinson has a sweet jester's disposition that keeps many of the gags from collapsing.",
            "It's often rote and by-the-numbers, but writer-director Tina Gordon Chism injects the proceedings with enough smart chat, clever situations and spot-on casting choices to make this well-traveled road feel a little less stale.",
            "A meet-the-parents-and-their-rigid-disapproval comedy, with a bit of fish-out-of-water humor tossed in.",
            "A strong debut effort such as this one deserves a chance to shine, and it'll be awesome to see what projects come Tina Gordon Chism's way after this promising debut effort. ",
            "Modest in aspiration, Peeples is by no means a must-see movie, but it's awfully charming all the same.",
            "Boasts a great cast, plenty of sharp dialogue, and perhaps most importantly, a sincerity and warmth absent from the majority of studio comedies nowadays. ",

            "This messy and oftentimes obnoxious comedy relies too often on cheap humor to get its points across.",

            "How did they convince Kerry Washington to be in this mess? Talk about a scandal!",
            "[Writer/director Tina Gordon Chism is ] good at low-key, observational humor, and the all-around excellent cast swings with aplomb from silly to sweet.",
            "The arch and resolution are some indication of how utterly lifeless Peeples is, both in the sense of lacking vitality and having no real connection to how people think, feel and react to situations.",
            "Let's be honest -- harmless it may be, but bad it most certainly is.",
            "No one looks more lost in the movie than Washington, its biggest right-this-moment star. ",
            "Formulaically funny, utterly familiar, fish-out-of-water story with a few absurdly engaging comedic touches.",
            "A Tyler Perry in producer-name only, 'Peeples' is an uneven comedy with a few laughs and no surprises.",
            "Craig Robinson deserves better. So do Kerry Washington, David Alan Grier, and everyone else who stands before the camera in this clunker.",
            "Funny but formulaic comedy has some edgy content.",
            "Better than pretty much everything else associated with Tyler Perry, but that's still not saying much. A talented cast is wasted. ",
            "Surely it would have been easier to shoot in Perry's home base of Atlanta, but the significant New England location places the movie at the geographical heart of America's origin story...",
            "Passably endearing despite its sometimes pronounced shortcomings."

            "Few films top Woody Allen's Manhattan for capturing New York City's blend of rapture and apprehension. Noah Baumbach's Frances Ha comes close.",
            "The [French] New Wave itself was a movement which had an of-by-for the youth vibe -- and just like Chabrol or Godard, Gerwig cuts her teeth with a film filled with youthful preoccupations.",

            "Frances Ha is a funny, sympathetic, perfect take on the golden age for not feeling golden about your life.",
            "A film that both of its co-creators can be incredibly proud of, Baumbach's Frances Ha has aligned two of America's most promising independent talents and created perhaps one of the most endearing and affable efforts to have emerged over recent years. ",
            "A dramatically more nuanced and studied work than might initially seem apparent.",
            "Shot in black and white, that and Gerwig's completely endearing, awkward and naturalistic acting style make it feel a bit My First Film, which is weird because Baumbach typically makes terrifically self-assured movies.",
            "Yes, it is rather kooky, and highly self-conscious... but it's also sweet, endearing, touching, and features proper women you can actually believe in, and who aren't just drippily searching for love, which is something of a novelty.",
            "Plays less like a comedy than a horror movie, an uncomfortable journey through the hell of a rootless, self-conscious twenty-something with horribly pretentious friends.",
            "Part of the success of \"Frances Ha\" is due to Greta Gerwig's portrayal of Frances. Despite an occasional lapse into mannerisms...her performance is precise, and some kind of inner light shines through her occasionally clumsy physical presence.",
            "I went fully prepared to hate it -- tried quite hard, in fact -- but it's so inoffensive that I couldn't help but enjoy it.",
            "Frances gets knocked around by the city and her peers, but she emerges triumphant. So does Baumbach's delightful film.",
            "A carefree character piece by filmmaker Noah Baumbach, actress Greta Gerwig drives the comedy into a place where very clever and high-spirited dialogue prevails.",
            "It's a creative marriage forged in heaven or at least the Manhattan equivalent.",

            "This all may sound all very heavy, but it is important to also point out that Hannah Arendt is also a good movie. ",
            "I found [Hannah Arendt] fascinating, though its lecture style may not appeal to some.",
            "Although the movie etches a rather thin portrait of Arendt, it succeeds in humanizing her as a person, contextualizing her as a theorist, and evoking the courage she showed in airing convictions that often went against the scholarly tenor of her time.",
            "Hannah Arendt is ultimately a pleasure, because Sukowa plays the most forbidding of intellectuals as a fabulous, passionate doll.",
            "...actors in supporting roles telegraph the controversies surrounding Arendt's personality as if they were attempting to literally touch the viewer's nose.",
            "Von Trotta doesn't do justice to this strong woman and her contribution to thinking about the nature of evil. ",
            "A crisply measured character study with plenty of intriguing ideas, elevated by a terrific, finely calibrated performance by Sukowa.",
            "A dramatically solid, if talky, account of the controversial episode in the post-war world that spawned the phrase \"the banality of evil\", with strong performances from Barbara Sukowa and Janet McTeer.",
            "I really like this film. I like the milieu that's created of this intellectual life in New York during the 1950s. I think Sukowa is fantastic in the role.",
            "It's refreshing to find a film inspired by challenging ideas, and Von Trotta and her team are to be congratulated for bringing Arendt's story to the screen",
            "it is as a piece of drama about the human condition that this film needs to be assessed, and on that score - with a few quibbles about structure and flashbacks and occasional lack of clarity - it is successful, in its own rigorous way",
            "Totalitarianism with sinful intentions versus bureaucratic compliance is what is on the menu - the result is more interesting on an academic and intellectual level than in actual engagement and entertainment terms",
            "From watching Hannah Arendt, we learn that it is possible to make a taut, compelling film about intellectuals, their opinions and discourse.",
            "Hey, who doesn't love a good retrospective courtroom drama, or a tasteful picture about a smart writer having a think?"

            "Before long the movie -- as neatly constructed as it is -- isn't really behaving like a movie, but more like life, as it's lived by a fractious pair of empty nesters who find themselves at a crossroads.",
            "As this pair mooch about town, Broadbent and Duncan negotiate their transitions in mood with a style that effortlessly conveys the sense of an entire life unfolding.",
            "This is a beautifully executed, fearlessly truthful and droll film on the emotional politics of reinvention.",
            "Once the characters start explaining the sources of their unhappiness, the drama becomes less compelling, largely because their problems seem far from insurmountable.",

            "As moving as it is engaging and astute.",

            "Confuses a one-dimensional, borderline sadistic view of the mitigations that come with ageing to their actual reality (which is surely a lot more nuanced and less miserable)!",
            "Wonderful performances (including a fun but quite \"huh?\" supporting turn from Jeff Goldblum) and nice aesthetics help make Le Week-end a passable trip to Paris,",
            "The script falters as domestic drama turns to contrived farce, and the couple runs out on an expensive dinner check. What is this, Frances Ha?",
            "The film's uncomfortable emotional tone is well balanced and heightened by the majestic architecture and skies of the city, a city they can't truly enjoy until its almost too late.",
            "The sublime talents of British thespians Jim Broadbent and Lindsay Duncan allow the comedic drama \"Le Week-End\" to travel beyond cheap cliches and tired road-trip gags into more thought-provoking territory.",
            "This isn't just about sex, it's a film about ageing, and the slights and delights of realising your life has never been your own. Unlike many Hollywood films, it doesn't make older people look angry or infantile. How refreshing.",
            "The banter is clever, yet so candid that the audience feels a bit sheepish. We're overhearing a wholly believable private conversation; these two are most definitely not on their best behavior. No company manners here. ",
            "Beautifully written and performed, there are biting truths here that will resonate with anyone who's lived in a long term relationship. ",
            "It's rare to see a film about late middle-age, which is neither pure escapism nor about people at the end of their rope.",
            "Le Week-End isn't nearly the comic lark the trailer would have you believe. It's much better than that: a poignant look at a relationship whose embers of love are barely glowing, but whose principals still like each other too much to split up",
            "The film hits the mark on couples struggling to find that balance between individuality and union with Broadbent and Duncan providing pitch-perfect performances.",

            "Somehow it's all very entertaining and weird and fitting, with Detroit looking like a place any vampire would be happy to be.",
            "You don't so much watch this movie as slink into it, joining an unlikely pair of lovers and enjoying their slouchy elegance.",
            "\"Only Lovers Left Alive\" breathes new and intriguing life into the vampire genre.",
            "Only Lovers is so fluidly edited and thinly plotted that it feels almost off-hand; yet, it's also made with great care, beautifully lit and set-designed to an eyelash.",
            "May very well be Jarmusch at his very best.",
            "Nothing much of note happens, despite their tenuous living arrangement seemingly likely to derail at any moment, but the undeniably rich world in which these fantastic players work their dark magic is thrillingly alive.",
            "A moody, atmospheric slice of vampire life that plays like a dirge or a funeral song. ",
            "Jarmusch's vision unquestionably pays tribute to rockstar life, vampire gothic horror, and universal art when mixing genres. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Intense, darkly amusing and with a killer couple in Swinton and Hiddleston, Only Lovers Left Alive proves that vampires aren't just about the fangs and blood but a never-ending life - and how you live it.",
            "A film to beguile, Only Lovers brings together the very best elements of cinema-sparkling script, exceptional performances, stunning visuals, oh-so-perfect soundtrack-under the skilled eye of [Jim] Jarmusch, a filmmaker with unique vision. ",
            "Jarmusch. Vampires. Indie rock. Really? [Full review in Spanish].",
            "Nobody in this film is entirely unlikable, and each is portrayed by an actor you could listen to talk for hours. ",
            "I recommend sitting back, letting the amazing soundtrack work its magic and wonder about how great it could be to live like the two main characters.",
            "There is something sexy about the type of languid decay we see throughout Only Lovers Left Alive...",
            "What makes Lovers so excellent and unusual is the serious attention Jarmusch devotes to the trouble with being immortal.",
            "Although a darkly comic watch, Only Lovers Left Alive is ultimately a meditation on love and aging, lacking the bite to be a truly original reinterpretation of the vampire mythos.",
            "With a beautiful colour palette and the comfort of cluttered sets, Jarmusch wraps you in a cocoon of an introverted, isolated world that only the characters and the viewers understand. ",
            "Only Lovers Left Alive is one of Jarmusch's most alluring films stylistically, but the self-conscious, often silly script makes it hard to fully indulge in its sensual wonders.",
            "Some will want the film to escalate in a way that it is never really likely to; instead it should just be enjoyed as a ride through the ghostly Detroit where one can luxuriate in the moody, chic milieu, not to mention the soundtrack.",
            "Jarmusch is a man who knows how to set a scene, and he does it well.",
            "There are horror elements in Only Lovers Left Alive, but mostly it's there so that we can enjoy seeing Swinton and Hiddleston et al in top form. ",
            "[Only Lovers Left Alive] provid[es] us with considered ruminations on time, comfort in connecting, and the progress of humanity in art and science."

            "We're in that strange area where a film balances between two opposite ends: it's impossible to hate, but really tough to love",
            "To wrap up, Black Nativity isn't the best holiday film we have this season and probably won't clean up at the cinema because in the end it's just a quite average movie. ",
            "Even though the principal (and poignant) message of forgiveness eventually wins through, the melodrama endured to get there is a high price to pay.",

            "This story of seasonal healing ultimately feels too predictable and heavy-handed to bring much uplifting Christmas cheer.",

            "You'd have to be pretty full of seasonal humbug to resist this ...",
            "Hudson's singing and Whitaker's acting compensate somewhat, but for a truly inventive and uplifting African-American piece set in New York during the Yuletide season, skip Black Nativity and watch Run-DMC's \"Christmas in Hollis\" music video instead.",

            "Artists including Mick Jagger talk about their backing singers -- and the soundtrack is, of course, heavenly.",
            "20 Feet from Stardom, this year's Oscar-winner for Best Documentary, is both rousing, upbeat fare... and a film steeped in a strange sense of yearning and regret.",
            "An enjoyable arts feature with its heart in the right place ...",
            "Such a great idea for a documentary, and such a surprise to realise that it has never been done before.",
            "This is a musical field of dreams high in corn, but also, sometimes, in the epiphanic empowerment and wonder of stardom conferred.",
            "A warm and fitting tribute to talented singers.",
            "I've found myself wholly involved, enthralled by these incredible singers and moved by their stories of unappreciated talent. ",
            "If you're a fan of any songs from 1950s onwards, you're going to want to watch this. ",
            "There is also the reality that many face of failed solo careers, manipulation by record executives and even a lack of appreciation from the same artists whose music they help create.",
            "The movie pays a long-overdue tribute to their glorious pipes, but also engages with the disconnection between talent and stardom, and while it isn't exactly an expos\u00e9 of the music industry, infuriating details emerge.",
            "It is a bit ironic that the film we could have seen is somewhere to the side of this one, probably no more than 20 feet away.",
            "Both a sight for sore eyes, and a clearing of blocked ears.",
            "No murders or revolutions necessary in this well-constructed and moving exploration of great talents who deserve their dues.",
            "The Oscar-nominated documentary 20 Feet From Stardom attempts to right this injustice by focusing on [Merry] Clayton and a number of other backup singers whose voices we know, but whose names we often do not.",
            "The parade of incredible women, the stream of songs you won't believe they sang on, and those irresistible voices belting out keep the rhythm going through the schmaltz, even if the conductor seems to have dropped his hymn book.",
            "If 20 Feet from Stardom has a flaw, it's one that's impossible to fix: It could be more, bigger, longer; it could be a miniseries, a Behind the Music of the voices you know but don't necessarily recognize.",
            "20 Feet has fingers in a lot of narrative pies, but it's most interesting when it focuses on the singers' struggles in a historical context.",
            "As much bittersweet as inspirational.",
            "It certainly a must watch for music lovers and for those curious to see the pivotal role that back-up singers played in shaping pop and rock classics of the 60s and 70s.",
            "Joyous, uplifting, melancholy and nostalgic, Twenty Feet From Stardom is a stunning salute to the singers who stay in the background, but whose talents can never be contained there.",
            "While there are moments in the film awkwardly placed to achieve moments of pensiveness from the talent, what it does well is offers a point of view where there wasn't before.",
            "As illuminating as it is thoroughly entertaining.",
            "Just thrilling. Watching this movie feels like finally giving credit where it's overdue.",
            "Smart, thoughtful docu shines light on background singers."

            "Needless to say, The Keanu hasn't got a patch on either Fincher or Assayas stylistically, and while his casting of himself as the eeeevil villain may have been a bold move, his performance could be a career-worst.",
            "As a martial arts action film, Man of Tai Chi is fun enough -- the fights are engaging, Chen's moves are breathtaking, and Keanu Reeves goes full Keanu Reeves.",
            "Yes, it's irreverent at times, but Man Of Tai Chi exudes confidence in its silliness, too, never actually treating the subject of martial arts as light or inconsequential.",
            "Man of Tai Chi is probably one of the best martial arts films this side of The Raid.",
            "Pro forma, sure, but briskly paced. For the most part, the fight scenes are grounded in physical potential, but there are shots and edits that have simple physical magic to them.",
            "While Reeves exhibits natural talent behind the camera, his debut carries an austere coldness that shuts out any semblance of diverting pleasure.",

            "Impressive fight choreography is the highlight of this otherwise muddled, bilingual directorial debut from Keanu Reeves.",

            "When it was first released back in 2003 Park Chan-wook's Oldboy hit audiences like a hammer. Forget Spike Lee's 2013 US remake with Josh Brolin, this South Korean film is the only version of Oldboy that needs to be seen.",

            "A story of revenge served both hot and cold, this is a heady mix of eye-popping fighting, deadpan humour, graphic torture and grungy cinematography.",

            "Banzai-violence kin to \"Cast Away\" about a man at time's cruel whim, \"Oldboy\"is an endurance test worth taking. Its conclusion is the most sadistic and destructively wrathful since \"Seven,\" and the point of no return has rarely shocked this much.",

            "This a film that lives in the fine details and that means its got loads of rewatchability. Though it's by no means one of Malick's best, it certainly stands head and shoulders above most of the shlock in the multiplexes. ",
            "It is destined to be a film embraced by some, loathed by many, and misunderstood by most.",
            "It is undeniable to say that To The Wonder would have been an excellent silent film, but since it is not, the problem here is its narrative, the unfriendly characters and, obviously, the drought of the dialogues. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Although the filmmaker often puts specifically Christian imagery into his film, his sensibility turns out to be more Zen: he can find manifestations of glory in both the noblest gesture and the darkest impulse. ",
            "...To The Womder rises above its several flaws, proving to be a sensory visual feast that captures the soul of life in all its wonder.",
            "To the Wonder's scenario threatens to become a hermetic montage of Malick tropes. All divine energy without the gravitas of the dark matter.",
            "Experimentation in form is always a welcome license of the talented director. But complete liberation from all narrative structure also demands that something else of interest take its place, and To the Wonder never finds that interest. ",

            "Where The Tree of Life was sanctimonious, To the Wonder is about the failure of sanctimony.",
            "A sinuous tapestry of breathtaking imagery, To the Wonder is undeniably a beautiful example of a visionary filmmaker creating yet another visual rhapsody.",
            "One of the best expositions of the perceptual potential of cinema; Malick succeeds in crystallising the precarious sentiment of emotion in the early stages of a relationship.",
            "To the Wonder is intoxicating, no doubt, but not as a movie. Watched in a theater, it's boring and pretentious. It would actually serve much better playing on a wall at a party.",
            "Is Malick so revered that nobody has the presence of mind to sit down with him and plead, \"Please, Terrence: enough with the twirling!\"",

            "It's watchable, at times sexy, at others painfully touching, yet seems random, lifeless and obscure. ",
            "As far as a plot goes, To the Wonder does not tell a story as much as present a cast, place them in a situation with minimal dialogue, and allow the audience to fill in the vast spaces that stretch out beyond."

            "Whenever Moore is off screen - the only character with size-10 oomph - the film risks evaporating altogether. Moral: it isn't that easy to modernise Henry James.",

            "The narrative's linchpin is Maisie and much of the film's momentum comes from Aprile's ability to channel her quicksilver state of mind.",
            "The deeply affecting Maisie is a tyke-oriented tearjerker that works on the soul. What Maisie Knew is what we all should know...the truthfulness of tears and triumph in the eyes of an innocent adolescent looking for a well-deserved childhood comfort zone.",
            "I don't know where the directors (Scott McGehee and David Siegel) discovered Miss Aprile, or how they elicited her performance but, my God, she knocks it out the court. Over and over.",
            "In the first hour of the movie I found myself loving the acting, compelled by the story, and mildly disgusted by the saccharine, twinkly-indie-chick music. I'm sorry to say that by the end the music has taken over.",
            "Soft-centred and bland though it is as a version of [Henry] James, the McGehee-Siegel What Maisie Knew is worth seeing for the performances.",
            "The acting is marvellous - never teetering into easy caricature - while the drama is sensitive, humorous and tear-jerking.",
            "Henry James's complicated and courageous novel has been distilled down to a screed about the dangers and consequences of bad parenting.",

            "It's often-heartbreaking stuff, but never feels manipulative, mostly because the movie puts itself in Maisie's shoes. Strongly recommended",
            "Scott McGehee and David Siegel's adaptation commendably preserves the book's child perspective even if it doesn't quite match the characteristically dark shades of the author's moral fare.",
            "A superb, moving film, it's a tribute to author Henry James that his 1897 story could prove so illuminating when adapted for the 21st century. Performances throughout are terrific, seeped as they are in guilt, resentment and confusion.",
            "The filmmakers, Scott McGehee and David Siegel, seem not at all intimidated by Henry James's formidable prose.",
            "Some scenes are tinged with dark comedy; some are heartrending; and some fuse the two, as when Maisie comforts a tearful friend during a sleepover in Susanna's huge Manhattan townhouse, while the delinquent grown-ups indulge themselves downstairs."

            "Binoche is impressive, bringing a steely, self-contained detachment to even the most intimate moments with her family. But Erik Poppe, the director, slathers the film in overly sentimental music choices",
            "If I'm complaining about this movie a lot for one I'm deeming better than fair, it's because I was frustrated by how its first-rate ingredients, Binoche chief among them, somehow failed to create a spectacular end result.",
            "Poppe registers Rebecca's moral commitment as well as the compulsive aspect of her dedication but the film oscillates between drama and statement; it becomes a series of set-pieces and what-ifs, particularly towards the end.",
            "This potent Norwegian drama by Erik Poppe, himself a veteran war photographer, opens with a gripping sequence.",
            "The whole cast is good, but as always, all roads lead to Binoche, who is wonderful.",
            "Poppe can't match the stunning opener of Binoche photographing a suicide bomber in Kabul with scenes of domesticity. But Binoche never falters. She's the film's fire and grieving heart. ",
            "As for Binoche, her performance as Rebecca is a standout even in a year that included winning turns in films from Fred Schepisi and Olivier Assayas. ",
            "... although at times the story seemed unsurprising, the end really packs a punch. There are lots of layers to unfold here, both personal and political. ",
            "Despite Binoche's mighty efforts, 1,000 Times Good Night never recovers from its self-congratulatory ambitions and mechanical plotting. It's the movie that winds up shell-shocked.",
            "The geopolitical realities of 2015 entitle us to expect something more nuanced than this.",
            "Shot with a gorgeous eye, the filmmakers aren't afraid of lens flare or overexposure to add an ethereal beauty to horrific circumstances of which we're bracing for impact.",
            "Alas, following on from such a striking and tense opening was always going to be difficult. The focus swiftly shifts to an account of disturbed domesticity, and so does the A Thousand Times Good Night's effectiveness and interest.",
            "Anger and anguish visible in her eyes and etched in the lines of her face, Juliette Binoche delivers a terrific performance.",
            "It's a rich, fascinating and provocative film that never takes sides or opts for easy answers.",
            "I wanted it to be more than it was.",
            "When we see photos or film footage taken at great risk on the front line we rarely stop to think of the price paid by the photographer; this film rectifies that.",
            "In a heart-wrenching performance, Juliette Binoche haunts as a war-photographer whose camera acts as her moral compass but blinds her to her family's needs",
            "Moving story about mother/war photograher has mature themes.",
            "As one would expect with of a film made by a photographer, 1,000 Times Good Night is always visually interesting. ",
            "Despite a screenplay that lets her down for the most part, Binoche is wonderful as Rebecca, a woman divided by her passion for the job and maternal instincts.",

            "Blackfish is a heartbreaking documentary, forensically constructed by Gabriella Cowperthwaite, about the extreme psychological distress of killer whales kept in captivity and used to entertain crowds at venues such as SeaWorld in Orlando.",
            "Blackfish makes an especially strong case for the innate marvel of these animals: that they are smart, social, communicative and loving.",
            "In the wild, orcas live between 50 and a hundred years. In captivity, it's half that. It's simply a strong argument to free all the Willies.",
            "\"Blackfish\" is a disturbing movie, one that will make you rethink parks like SeaWorld and their value.",
            "After seeing this documentary, it would probably make you think twice about SeaWorld.",
            "An illuminating documentary not only about the cruel conditions that killer whales endure at theme parks such as Sea World, but the biology and psychology of the mysterious and majestic sea wolf.",
            "Blackfish is a well-edited and intriguing documentary, which delivers its message in a subtle yet memorable way. Shows featuring killer wales will never be seen in the same light again.",
            "Nothing says \"family fun\" like aquatic murder and animal mistreatment, right SeaWorld?",
            "Blackfish unfolds as a documentary thriller, the portrait of a predator with a string of gruesome homicides on his record. But Tilikum is not cast as a villain like the shark in Jaws. ",
            "Cowperthwaite's Blackfish is compulsive and emotive viewing, and far more chilling than your typical horror, that really deserves to be seen.",
            "With extensive interviews and an impressive amount of footage, Cowperthwaite stops just short of exploitation. ",
            "Blackfish is a powerful reminder of how willfully ignorant - and how selfish - humanity can be.",
            "... a startling, disturbing, moving portrait of the male orca known as Tilikum, who currently resides at SeaWorld Orlando.",
            "Forcing killer whales to wave a fin at audiences from their watery jail cell is an inherent immorality that is brought thrashing to the surface in this documentary. ",
            "You won't forget Cowperthwaite's documentary, and you shouldn't.",
            "The product of Gabriela's research-alongside co-writer Eli B. Despres-is the riveting documentary Blackfish.",
            "Must be seen by audiences, and should be mandatory for wildlife lovers and advocates, so we can prevent another corrupt organization like Seaworld from ever rising to prominence again.",
            "Really great documentaries are like zeitgeist napalm; and Blackfish carries the torch.",
            "For all it's artistic shortcomings, though, I really hope that this movie is able to instigate some kind of change in the way we treat orcas, or at least how we think about them.",
            "Powerful, heartbreaking, disturbing doc about captive orcas.",
            "Perhaps the documentary form does have the potential to effect sweeping social change. Only time will tell. ",
            "Blackfish delivers ominous chills not because it documents orca whale attacks, but because it makes a clear, strong case that the attacks are of humankind's making. It's more Frankenstein than Jaws."

            "Brie Larson is very impressive as the caring, funny supervisor whose own demons threaten to engulf her.",
            "Set in a foster-care facility outside of San Francisco, this independent drama is vivid and heartfelt in its depiction of social work, at times recalling some of Frederick Wiseman's great documentary portraits.",
            "The film's climax feels a little rushed and overwrought, but the movie's real resonance is its exploration of empathy and vocation.",
            "At times Short Term 12 seems uncertain where it's going, but this matches the circumstances of both staff and residents.",
            "Short Term 12 wants to shine a light on these under-paid, under-valued figures and cheats, just a little, to get the job done.",
            "Well intentioned, but somehow inauthentic.",
            "It's a quietly moving drama, so brilliantly written and performed.",
            "The film always searches for truth in its sincerest form - it never drifts towards melodrama.",
            "There's a tendency for movies like Short Term 12 to be overwrought or contrived in their handling of such a sensitive story. However, Cretton avoids the pitfalls of the genre by balancing out the story with an intense and masterfully deployed empathy.",
            "The questions arise in an impeccable narration, with certain addictions of indie cinema, but with agility and freshness. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "One of my \"Must See\" LAFF films, Short Term 12 is moving, motivational, hopeful, inspiring.",
            "Short Term 12 races by with its brief running time, but its ambling plot works to reveal a naturalistic discovery of its characters.",
            "Impeccably performed by the whole cast, Short Term 12 is an exhausting ride through every emotion possible.",
            "Short Term 12 lives and breathes true reality onto the movie screen better than most documentaries can.",
            "This look at the staff and clients at a foster care facility compels with its naturalistic approach and delivers believable scenarios and dialogue, while showcasing its young stars.",
            "Short Term 12 gets right for much of the film, what so many other films about human services get wrong. ",
            "A funny, beautiful and wonderfully honest film built around an exceptional turn from Larson. ",
            "I'm attracted to films that feel REAL, and Short Term 12 definitely definitely does. In no small part to the acting - the kids in this are nothing less than fantastic.",
            "Has the viewer well and truly captured in its lonely, wretched basis.",
            "That sputtering noise you hear in the nobly intentioned, intermittently moving Short Term 12 is the sound of feminism backfiring as it meets screenplay formulas.",
            "... a rare, unmissable gem; yes, it's a showcase for its stunning performers and necessary story, but it also pushes us to look at our own emotions, experiences, and relationships in the process ... ",
            "This feel-everything drama is one of those honest and intimate scripts that come out of nowhere to say something incredibly meaningful and memorable.",
            "Moving into darker territory where the mumblecore milieu would never venture, Short Term 12 offers a much-needed corrective to the indie-darling set-particularly in its curiously optimistic ending.",
            "[Larson] delivers a character that feels achingly human, and she does it brilliantly."

            "The effective mix of old and new that courses through the film's entire bloodstream is evident from its opening title sequence, a bold and elegant fetishization of a piano that makes its outer contours sexy and its interior strings appear sharp.",

            "Grand Piano can be enjoyed from multiple perspectives: it will satisfy the film buff, the tech hound, and the sit-back-and-be-entertained audience.",
            "Eugenio Mira's Grand Piano is a stylish and taut thriller that wastes no time on spectacle, instead choosing to meticulously focus on story, characters, atmosphere and building tension throughout.",
            "...quite engaging for the duration of its 90 minutes.",
            "Entertainingly preposterous ...",
            "It's ridiculously far-fetched, and classical concertgoers will wince at the script's wilful blunders, but flamboyant camerawork and a delicious streak of dark humour make it ridiculously enjoyable, too.",
            "The tension fizzles once the reasons for the gunman's motives become evident. A shame, as it's an intriguing conceit.",
            "The concept of this real time thriller is, of course, extremely silly, but it keeps you entertained.",
            "Complete codswallop but not entirely awful."

            "The performances of all three young actors are superb, soulful, honest and full of joy. Their dialogue is often ridiculously funny and there's no sense of manufactured drama.",

            "The whole thing is very smart and sweet, as are the performances.",
            "This is a knowing film, and a liberating one.",
            "It's the details of the journey that matter in this good-natured film. Bobo, Klara, and Hedwig's story of Sweden's finest teenage girl punk band will feel universal to everyone who has ever set out to prove that punk won't die on their watch.",
            "We Are the Best (Vi \u00e4r bast) sports a cocksure swagger in its title alone, and rightfully so. It is a boisterous rejoinder to the usual simplistic, tame depiction of adolescent girls. ",
            "Moodysson's film is hard to dislike, and while it puts more emphasis on the light in light-hearted, We Are The Best! is time well spent.",
            "We Are the Best is a warm-hearted crowd and critics pleaser about coming of age, and female friendship that passes the Bechdel Test.",
            "Expertly combining a youthful desire for agency and rebellion with the death throes of the Swedish punk movement, it's a heart-warming tale with three captivating performances from its young female leads.",
            "We Are The Best isn't quite as sharp or funny as [Lukas Moodysson's] two previous films. Still, the film is delightful and, like Moodysson's other films, has special insight into the lives of adolescent girls. ",
            "Befitting the plucky spirit and gaucheness of his three protagonists, Moodysson keeps the scenario simple, avoiding the temptation to overly determine and politicise the story",
            "The casting could not have been better, and considering this is the feature film debut for all three actors, it amplifies the film's authenticity and heart.",
            "In the end it's just three girls on a stage, together, and they really are the best.",

            "[We are the Best] is a warm, spirited and uplifting film about teen rebellion.",
            "What makes [We Are the Best!] so wonderful, is that these girls are very much their own people: tough to categorize, unlike anyone you've seen on-screen before, but completely recognizable.",

            "Moodysson gives his characters the perfect mix of love, protection, and freedom",
            "For all their moodiness and irascibility, the girls come across as warm and believable, and there are funny moments when they take to the streets to raise money for a new guitar."

            "Seyfried is remarkable as Linda, showing the woman's duality of hope and fear, acquiescence and anguish, in sequences that require a multitude of conflicting emotions.",
            "What is fascinating about the film is the way the format, showing us the same events twice and from two different perspectives, helps to tell the story: not that porn is evil, but that porn is a lie.",
            "Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman... quickly show their true colours, more concerned with aesthetics and narrative gimmickry - provided by writer Andy Bellin - than the tragic tale itself.",

            "Familiar territory: celebrity woman with a man beating the crap out of her. We've seen this before in What's Love Got to Do With It and in Star 80. Unfortunately, these movies weren't just earlier than Lovelace; they were stronger. ",
            "The notorious performer's story is told in the provocatively written, well-acted biopic Lovelace.",
            "Ironically, even a movie about Linda Lovelace's rather sad life uses her more for her body than her character.",

            "With its soap-operatic performances, bonkbuster plotline and sparkling seafront setting, all 'Adore' really lacks is a cameo from Alf Stewart",
            "Would Fontaine have made this film if the mothers looked like and were as old as Barbra Streisand and Kathy Bates and the sons weren't built like surfers? Of course not.",
            "This isn't an Oedipus complex. This is a Preposterous complex.",
            "Cast actresses with the skills that Naomi Watts and Robin Wright bring, give their obliviously icky story some arthouse visual lyricism, and you've got \"Adore.\"",
            "Adore is, as my late mother would say in describing Sidney Sheldon novels, good trash.",
            "An exceedingly silly, sun-baked sex movie, the kind of import that adds just enough brains to its genitals to get into U.S. arthouses. (In the '70s, the mothers would have been played by Laura Antonelli and Sylvia Kristel.)",
            "Its Australian title, 'Adoration', sounds as flat on the tongue and unsure of itself as the actual film. Anne Fontaine never finds the right voice for her film's message and ends up with this disappointing, albeit handsomely made, effort. ",
            "There's a fascinating depth to this challenging piece, even if you are laughing when you're not supposed to.",
            "As crazy as it may seem, it's a pretty compelling journey to watch.",
            "While Adore is based on some fairly salacious material, it tries to be an earnest drama examining the nature of friendship and lust and leaving convention behind. Unfortunately, Adore is a snore.",
            "Christopher Hampton's pared-back screenplay and Christophe Beaucarne's ravishing lensmanship locate the action in a reality that is only a blink away from the simmering landscape of the unconscious.",
            "This film needed serious judgment: someone to rewrite the underwritten draft of the script and to have a firmer opinion on these terribly unappealing characters",
            "There's more depth and feeling to the admittedly provocative premise of this twisted sexual drama than you might expect...It's the excoriating payoff to the story that makes Adoration a cautionary tale with a major sting.",
            "The worst part of Adoration was when I returned to my car and had to pay for my parking, realising that the awfulness of the movie actually took a quantifiable toll on my life: 111 minutes, and $8.50. ",
            "Viewed again, far from the madding crowd and general hoo-ha of Sundance, it stands up much better than expected.",
            "Their world seems to hover between their own fantasy and the castrated culture which Fontaine creates. A nothingness envelops them",
            "Melodramatic with a plot more suited to a TV soapie, Christopher Hampton's adaptation of Doris Lessing's 2003 novella The Grandmothers is overblown and totally unbelievable",
            "The film never musters the humor nor the sex appeal to carry off its study of ultra-Freudian arrested development.",
            "Adore is just completely absurd and melodramatic, where major things happen to our protagonists and they just brush it off.",
            "Fontaine has trouble balancing the complexities. Both women express a world of conflicting emotions in their gazes, but the younger men seem lost in their roles.",
            "Adore is nothing more than a hateful excuse for a piece of cinema. Avoid it at all costs.",
            "Watchable soapy melodrama enlivened by gorgeous photography and strong performances from all four leads ...",
            "Sets the bar pretty low, and achieves its goal.",
            "'Adore' has received mostly negative reviews. The dismissiveness suggests a discomfort with the subject matter -- an unwillingness to process this particular fiction by writers who on other days grapple agreeably with haunted houses and singing chipmunks."

            "The monumental hand-wringing about Kennedy feels, the further we get away from the event, somehow inappropriate.",
            "As pure docudrama Parkland is a let down. As a tribute to a great political leader it's bordering on insult.",
            "[A] howling dud.",
            "Kennedy specialists will glean nothing new, and those hoping for sobriety will flinch at the camera's intrusions.",
            "The film finds its strength in the quintet of lesser known players, especially Zapruder and, oddly enough, Oswald's stoic brother, who's cast in a heroic, almost Kennedy-esque, light.",
            "What might have made a terrific television series is instead a mediocre - if historically interesting - film.",
            "Parkland is little more than the audible whimper of a people ruminating over a great tragedy.",
            "The acting, by stars such as Zac Efron, Paul Giamatti, Billy Bob Thornton and James Badge Dale, is low-key and magnificent.",
            "The performances are powerful, the authenticity is admirable, and the tone remains objective in its depiction of events throughout.",
            "A ( ... ) pragmatic, four-day, fly-on-the-wall view of Dallas when the 20th Century's most documented death arguably facilitated the birth of 24-hour rolling news, citizen journalism and You Tube.",
            "Had Landesman spent a bit more time on his characters and narrative, he might have made a more watchable movie.",
            "I suppose each generation gets the JFK movie it deserves. We should feel lucky to get this one.",
            "Parkland is a movie of simple motives. It doesn't waste time with pomp or theory, and the material is acted by those who connect with the characters like reflections in the mirror. ",
            "Ultimately Parkland is not thought-provoking, inspiring or even brave enough to be offensive, but it does raise some interesting scenarios and is full of some very solid acting.",
            "While not bound for classic status, the film still manages to capture a moment in time that changed our country.",
            "The revelations are unshowy, the emotional clout is stealthy, and JFKologists can rest easy knowing that the project neither engages with nor contradicts their pet preoccupations.",
            "Parkland remains a bystander in the already overcrowded field of films about the events of November 1963.",
            "A personal history of a very public disaster that fails to hit as hard as it might as the voices chosen aren't strong enough as written to speak for the people who were there on the day President Kennedy came to town. ",
            "A sad tale well told.",

            "The interiors of our likeable lovers have not been furnished substantially enough to suggest real lives beyond the hotel walls.",
            "Bonnell's latest is a surprisingly effective two-hander, conveying an unprecedented emotional depth about passion, the performance of it, and how life has a surprising way of reminding us how to feel alive.",
            "Ultimately, Just a Sigh is a mediocre, \"day-in-the-life\" film that would have made an incredible short, as one gets the sense that this is far too stretched out to qualify as a solid feature-length film.",
            "A complex experience, the pleasure of Just a Sigh exists mostly in its visuals, tonal shifts and performances.",
            "It adds up to a classy French melodrama that takes the strangers-on-a-train trope and produces an engaging love story.",
            "The scenes with Devos and Byrne strive for some emotional relevance, but \"Just a Sigh\" keeps derailing on all the trivial things Alix gets up to.",
            "Sigh doesn't capture the senses in a compelling manner, but its elusiveness is actually effective, requiring an audience willing to give up on reason to take on the mysteries of attraction. ",
            "Watching Devos slip in and out of Alix's various \"characters\" is one of the major pleasures of an otherwise modestly enjoyable film.",
            "French cinema has built many a masterpiece on the foundation of what may, on the surface, just seem like women wandering around. Sadly, 'Just A Sigh' is no 'Cleo From 5 To 7' or 'The Green Ray'. ",
            "We see a drum marching band plying there art for everyone's pleasure, a group of street singers entertain the bystanders and a street band gives a cool performance. But these are brief asides to the predominant (and stunningly dull) story.",
            "If it weren't for Devos, I'd happily translate the title of this one to \"Just a Slog,\" as getting through it was an endurance test from the forty minute mark onward.",
            "When Bonnell allows his two magnificent leads to work at the sparse dialogue, he invokes a powerful, elemental sense of frank, sexual discussion and high-end flirtation, imbuing the relationships with a maturity that's loathsomely rare in films today."

            "A stunning minimalist erotic thriller that explores with arresting photography and economical use of dialogue how human identity is defined, and sometimes imprisoned, by our desires, drives, and passions.",
            "Carefully and often brilliantly creates its own Eden-like universe.",
            "What sets the engrossing \"Stranger by the Lake\" apart is that its excesses seem to point to a moral purpose beyond shock or entertainment value.",
            "Alain Guiraudie's thriller is characterised both by its formal ingenuity and its surprisingly graphic gay sex. The plotting rekindles memories both of Patricia Highsmith novels and of Hitchcock films.",
            "Like a wry scientist, wading through the jungle, Guiraudie notes every tiny, unwritten law. It's infectious stuff.",
            "A simple and ruthlessly effective exercise in minimal narrative and style, Alain Guiraudie's moral tale is so restrained and atmospheric that the nudity and graphic sex don't upstage the creepy mood of seductive, inescapable doom.",
            "With a naturalistic ambient soundtrack and a nuanced grasp on how cruel queer guys can be when they're on the make, this gripping erotic thriller will take you on a rough and psychologically troubling ride.",
            "A moody, poetic piece about the nature of desire unfolding in a hidden place in plain view.",
            "Stranger By the Lake hearkens back to an era of daring cinema too rarely seen today.",
            "A compellingly eerie tale of identity, self-loathing, death and sex in a world we rarely see portrayed in film.",
            "The pace may be a little too relaxed at times, and I'll admit the ending left me feeling a little cheated, but Guiraudie is in total control for the entire film.",
            "Distributors seem not to realize that an explicit film about male cruising has the potential to attract an audience beyond just gay men: many women, straight and queer, are curious about the type of anonymous, repercussion-free sex shown in the film.",
            "Caressing and coaxing its way under your skin, Guiraudie's latest is an amorous, raw and chillingly seductive psychological thriller full of razor-sharp suspense and an abundance of stylish eroticism.",
            "In many ways, adhering as it does to semiotic storytelling and other visual tropes, this is a typical genre film. It's also daring and extremely good.",
            "Guiraudie's disciplined m.o. requires patience, and it leads to an ending that might frustrate viewers hoping for a more concrete narrative resolution to Franck's moral dilemma.",
            "This is a tale of danger and desires and extremely gay sportswear: possibly the Frenchest film I have ever seen.",
            "... many of my qualms evaporated in the movie's brutally suspenseful final 10 minutes...",
            "the stuff of porn flicks and of classical Greek sculpture, and it is to Alain Guiraudie's credit that he evokes the spirit of both as well as a dandy, ahem, Hitchcockian thriller",
            "While I found the characters interesting, the story was not very compelling and it was slow-moving as well. I learned a lot more about homosexual sex techniques than I wanted to know, and less about the characters than I wanted to know.",
            "Perfect, in that it achieves exactly what it meant to... portrays the world of casual sex and cruising with almost journalistic proficiency.",
            "Franck, so akin to Philip in Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage, knows in his heart that he is making a potentially deadly mistake, but his insatiable lust won't hear a word of it.",
            "The sexuality that builds tension early ends up being ultimately a distraction.",
            "While its pace meanders, Stranger by the Lake proves to be an engrossing and darkly humorous watch.",
            "Classically constructed, as rigid in its construction of suspense as any recent thriller, Alain Guiraudie's \"Stranger by the Lake\" is a masterful work, uncluttered yet lush, formally mechanistic, yet always surprising."

            "A dark piece of neorealism - and a searing indictment of Eastern Europe's newly moneyed classes ...",

            "Netzer crafts not only a chilling story of family dysfunction, but also an illuminating look into the corruption and decay of the Romanian bourgeoisie - without ever overplaying his hand. It all appears so effortless, when in fact it's so skillful.",
            "It's an acting tour de force and she (Gheorghiu) carries the film in a terrifying portrayal of both obsessive mother-love and also the symbolic privilege of her position",
            "Gheorghiu's performance is so complex, so nimble and unpredictable, it's breathtaking.",
            "Child's Pose locks you into its complex tale of emotional (and familial) blackmail from the very beginning, whilst never feeling the need to descend into out-and-out melodramatic.",
            "Filled with strong performances, especially from Gheorghiu, who makes out of Cornelia something more than just a campy overbearing matron.",
            "By the time Child's Pose ended all I could do was say \"Man, that was a great movie.\"",
            "From a beginning that merely sketches the outlines of Cornelia's upper-class existence - she could be a contender for \"The Real Housewives of Bucharest\" - \"Child's Pose\" takes on more emotional substance as it develops.",

            "Child's Pose is the sort of film that foregrounds a major event rather than a plot per se, in the hope that the exploration of said event will allow character nuance and social significance to waft up from cracks in the fa\u00e7ade.",
            "A gripping and thought-provoking drama that touches on the nature of grief and class corruption in the new Romania, the heart of Child's Pose is nevertheless its convincing study of a power struggle between mother and adult child. ",
            "There is, ultimately, little to recommend this film.",
            "We watch as attitudes get warped, compassion removed, and grief's all-consuming power possess victim and perpetrator alike.",
            "Another powerfully observed Romanian drama.",
            "What makes Cornelia fascinating is not just her rapaciousness and determination, but also the power of her love, albeit a love that smothers. Like King Lear, she is a monstrous parent, yet pitiable.",
            "A mother's love outruns her self-delusion in Child's Pose, an intense but downbeat entry in what's being called the \"Romanian new wave.\"",
            "Details are beautifully observed in lengthy, theatrical scenes, which may not have been sustainable without a captivating performance from Luminita Gheorghiu.",
            "Child's Pose, in addition to featuring [its] sensational mother-son act, is a fascinating look into a corrupt society that is at times equally jaw-dropping.",
            "Exploring morality and forgiveness, mixed with a curious family dynamic, Child's Pose is an involving piece of cinema.",
            "The pacing is unyieldingly slow, while also missing that sense of creeping escalation that makes the better films of the Romanian art house moment so dreadfully effective"

            "Suffers from a reality TV-ish veneer in its decided lack of depth.",
            "Yudin gets into the psyches of his subjects. Their ups and downs, highs and lows. The need to do well in competitions not only for personal glory but for the sponsorships that feed their families and keep them in the gym.",
            "Well-crafted, sympathetic and apparently fairly honest, but not as novel as it would have been in the pre-reality TV era, when the home lives of participants in obsessive family units and strange subcultures weren't an entertainment staple.",
            "... we are left to consider natural gifts versus applied science, and ponder why we usually credit the former more than the latter. Like all good stories, this movie about bodybuilding is really about much more.",
            "The film ends up being about much more than itself, much more than just bodybuilding or bodybuilders. Although a bit overlong, it is really a triumph of intelligent, strategic filmmaking.",
            "Suspenseful, well-edited and adequately illuminating without being too heavy or dry",
            "Yudin's decision to opt for a wide-ranging collection of shallow portraits sabotages any chance of learning something meaningful or profound about these men."

            "Medieval mumblecore. And social conflict as secondary to the scenery in this dramatic momentum-free travelogue, a treat solely for arty snobs and couch potato political dilettantes. Poverty porn as high art, and most memorable, a pregnant horse in labor.",
            "Without a character to connect with it all amounts to nothing but a poor man's Braveheart, minus that film's vigorous battle sequences.",

            "It's fitting that the first track we hear in this celebratory but emotionally dappled documentary is Wilson Pickett's Land of 1000 Dances. The rich, elemental energy of the recording encapsulates what would become known as the Muscle Shoals sound. ",
            "Even with its disappointments, Muscle Shoals can't help but make a hopeful sound.",
            "Hall's backstory, riddled with tragedy, gets the proper attention and respect here. But it's the music that won't let you stop watching.",
            "Camalier makes an excellent job of combining talking-head interviews with music, anecdotes and folklore.",
            "The anecdotes work without the music, but if you like the music... Dang, it's a stairway to heaven.",
            "A stubborn charmer whose life was a magnet for tragedy, Hall is the emotional centre not only of the Muscle Shoals sound but of this film.",
            "There is no doubt a variety of editorially rhythmic issues breakdown the musical flow of Muscle Shoals, but endure the touch and go structure and you'll find a wealth of rock 'n' roll history within.",
            "There is an over-reliance on commentary by platitude-spouting rock stars...but the film's great virtue is that it will introduce and remind viewers of the wonderfully varied trove of music that came out of these studios.",
            "It's the music here that shines brightest, and for fans of any of the artists involved, there's more than enough great content on show here to get feet tapping and hearts thumping. ",
            "The movie doesn't mention the contemporary Christian or gospel albums recorded at his studio. But what's there is so uplifting it's still well worth your time. ",
            "An occasionally doleful but otherwise lively trip, Muscle Shoals is yet another cinematic shout-out to those unsung heroes who came out of nowhere and made music that mattered.",
            "Camalier's tuneful if somewhat overlong anecdotal history does the most justice to the Muscle Shoals sound just by listening to it.",
            "Retrospective rockumentary deconstructs the secret of a legendary Alabama music studio's success.",
            "It is amazing to see how this style and sound came to fruition as it changed the careers of artists like Aretha Franklin and created some of the most memorable albums and songs from artists like Etta James, The Rolling Stones, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and [more].",
            "An extraordinary story of singers, songwriters, musicians, producers and, most of all, two recording studios in a small Southern city.",
            "A bit lengthy but packed with great music, this is a solid documentary that musicians and fans of soul music will likely enjoy. ",
            "Though Muscle Shoals can seem a little conventional, you could never say the same thing of its soundtrack",
            "Supremely enjoyable, Muscle Shoals doesn't add much to the record, but it will probably induce you to flip through your collection for a few to spin.",
            "Emotionally moving but messy, it survives thanks to its superb songs, great cinematography and insightful anecdotes - in spite of its lack of a satisfactory conclusion.",
            "What is it that makes the music recorded in the studios in this small, out-of-the-way part of Alabama so magical? That's the question this documentary film tries to answer.",
            "The movie never quite captures the magic of Muscle Shoals, but it's still fun to hear old pros like Aretha Franklin and Keith Richards trade tales.",
            "Its story is well-worth telling.",
            "It posits that the spirit of community forged by the musicians that created this music was part of its magic, and listening to it in the movie, it's hard to argue. The records they created defined an entire genre and hold up today as completely timeless.",
            "The film possesses considerable persuasive power despite its modest substance and simple construction, making it very much like the timeless songs it showcases. "

            "Yes, on some level it's just a seven-year check-in with people maybe half-remembered, if that. Yet the films also serve as a kind of check-in with us, too.",

            "It may be true that the character of a person may be more or less set by the time they are seven. But there's no predicting exactly where that character will lead.",
            "Fortunately, the structure of \"56 Up\" is complex enough to add layers of distance and irony to its subjects' present-day stories. As it reminds us, no one's life turns out quite like they planned it, even for relatively happy people.",
            "Here as always [Director Michael] Apted jumps between his subjects' variously aged selves with hypnotic, occasionally ruthless dexterity, mapping new narrative sequences and creating damning or salubrious conversations.",
            "Perhaps predictably the mellowest of the movies. They for the most part seem to have settled into an autumnal contentment. The big conflicts have been largely resolved.",

            "a window into our shared human experience, and a terrific one at that.",
            "56 Up has become a stirring reflection, even tribute, to the little bends and turns of ordinariness, the ebbs and surges of everyday lives.",
            "Apted's subjects would object to the idea that we really know them, but we think we do -- and that's good enough to make his film feel like a reunion, a visit with an old friend. Or 14 of them.",
            "Chances are that you'll come away from this long film feeling a sense of knowing its characters.",
            "We might say that '56 Up' serves much the same function as 'Amour,' but it responds to the inevitability of decline with compassion, not dread.",
            "What started as a crafty way of looking at the U.K.'s rigid class structure has grown into a portrait of melancholy middle age, with its heartbreaks and minor-key triumphs. ",
            "In 49 Up, many of the series' subjects seemed to be just settling into their bliss; now they're committed to it, and the foreclosed possibilities that come alongside. ",
            "Those British kids are now 56",
            "Watching the eighth film is intriguing but, in a way, disappointing. At this point in the game, it feels as if all the characters have determined their lots in life and are simply plodding through their interviews.",

            "This is a stark film, about the human condition at its most base and degraded.",
            "This is a difficult film, but made with impressive formal rigour.",
            "Throughout it all, Binoche's face shivers with emotions that Claudel herself cannot pin down.",
            "It is a deeply sombre, deeply affecting film, based on real events, about the ordeal of Camille Claudel.",
            "As non-plot becomes plot, so \"shapelessness\" finds its own shape. The film gathers mass, power and beauty as if unguided.",
            "Dumont's commitment to tone and aesthetics is remorseless - this was an injustice, and you will suffer accordingly for 94 minutes. But it's not just suffering for suffering's sake.",
            "The powerful evocation of a trapped soul rests entirely in the furrowed brow of Binoche... Camille Claudel is one of her most provocative performances yet.",
            "Camille Claudel 1915 is the first Dumont film I would truly consider boring. Everything it works so hard to convince us of, we have heard so many times before.",
            "With a stripped-down, bare-faced performance, Juliette Binoche is utterly wonderful in this tense French drama. ",
            "A powerhouse performance by Juliette Binoche provides the beating, tortured heart of this finely wrought and very affecting film about the later life of sculptor Camille Claudel.",
            "This later history of Claudel, which stars Juliette Binoche, is spare, harsh and minimalistic, as one would expect from Bruno Dumont.",
            "Binoche is excellent in a part that trades not on her beauty but her mind, portraying a woman whose talent made her dangerous in less enlightened times.",
            "A luminous performance from Juliette Binoche is the star attraction in this intense and challenging historical drama.",
            "The film stops dead in its tracks with the introduction of stout Catholic brother Paul Claudel.",
            "A measured, challenging historical drama but also one of Dumont's more accessible films.",
            "Juliette Binoche gives a wonderful performance as Camille, conveying the intelligence, anxiety, anger and isolation of an artist abandoned by her family.",
            "Juliette Binoche is brilliant, but the movie is a bit of a slog and its use of real mental patients as extras feels uncomfortably close to exploitation.",
            "What emerges is a demanding but hypnotic, probing portrait of an artist denied her art, by a director in total command of his.",
            "As meticulous as one of Claudel's sculptures, Hors Satan director Dumont and his star do this true-life story justice with an empathetic telling.",
            "An eerie and austere film charting the nightmarish response of the French sculptress to her imprisonment in an asylum.",
            "A deeply unsettling experience, a muffled cry from and for a woman cast aside by her family and by history. ",
            "Camille Claudel 1915 is a film of stark, sober rewards, and possibly Dumont's finest.",
            "The camera stays on [Binoche] for long periods, and we become complicit in her suffering. It's a great performance in a movie that is difficult to watch.",
            "At some point during the making of \"Camille Claudel 1915,\" writer-director Bruno Dumont surely must have considered featuring Juliette Binoche's face in extreme close-up for the film's entire running time."

            "Notable largely for the anguished, nuanced performance of Jessica Lange ...",
            "It's a difficult mix for a directorial debut and, whilst Charlie Stratton seems aware of all the strands, it fails to truly convey Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's sense of being trapped.",
            "Perhaps the story lends itself rather more to a TV serial, giving Therese time to suffer in her oppressive marriage before embarking on a reckless and ultimately doomed affair.",

            "If O. Henry and Edgar Allan Poe collaborated on a love story, it might look something like this juicy bit of ironic gothic romance.",

            "Abu-Assad does not aim for the Dardennes' breathless immediacy. Rather, the story is laid out in a lucid, diagrammatic way, like a mathematical proof that for someone in Omar's position there are no right choices. ",
            "Abu-Assad is simply reflecting the ever-changing nature of his characters' daily lives in a fraught and strange environment in which betrayal has become endemic.",
            "The story dishes out action and surprises without losing its political intent.",
            "Abu-Assad cares about his characters and their wretched but thrilling situations.",
            "A shell game of betrayal and counter-betrayal set in the worlds of police informing and sectarian score-settling on either side of the Israel-Palestine divide.",
            "This gripping Palestinian thriller evokes Gillo Pontecorvo's The Battle of Algiers in its depiction of not only the psychological pressures faced by people under occupation, but the murky moral consequences of retaliating.",
            "With Omar he has delivered an incredibly powerful story in a lean 90 minutes, a commendable economy that should be a lesson to the ever-increasing number of directors who believe a film must run to two-hour plus to deliver emotional weight.",
            "Omar is a suspenseful moral quandary, tripped up only be an illogical, but inevitable, conclusion.",
            "Though narratively uninspired and lacking strong performances to lead us through the tale, Abu-Assad's pensive examination of the toxic environment in the Middle East is as riveting as it was in his lauded suicide bomber drama.",
            "The action tropes handled so well in the film's first half are pushed aside for clumsy melodrama by the end of the film.",
            "There are no clear-cut good guys or bad guys in Palestinian director Hany Abu-Assad's stinging vision; no one in Omar exits with clean hands, which helps lift the movie above its grounding in the basics of film noir.",
            "Omar is a relatively undidactic take on the lives of ordinary Palestinians with no choice but to endure the indignities imposed by the constraints of Israel's \"separation wall.\"",
            "Omar is an obvious political thriller which consistently, insistently attempts to steer us in a particular direction.",
            "Beautifully shot, complicated, smart, and undeniably intense ... well-deserving of its place as the Palestinian nominee for this year's Best Foreign Language Film.",
            "Doesn't provide easy answers as it builds its pressure cooker environment, putting primary attention on the personalities involved, allowing for a human perspective as it details acts of breathless survival and suffocating paranoia.",
            "From button-pushing Palestinian writer/director Hany Abu-Assad, who gave us the inflammatory Paradise Now in 2005, comes an equally piercing, if less politically strident look at life under Israeli occupation.",
            "Bakri gives a richly detailed performance, often allowing his stoicism to slip and reveal the confused and angry young man within.",
            "This is a subtle political film: one that fully dramatises a situation and lets us think out its contradictions for ourselves.",
            "As in his Golden Globe-winning 2005 drama Paradise Now, Israeli filmmaker Hany Abu-Assad takes a complex, personal approach to a touchy political-religious situation in this Palestinian love story.",
            "The end result is a nerve-rattling entertainment flavoured by vigorous, deeply felt polemic. ",
            "A tense, involving combination of love story and thriller.",
            "Abu-Assad brings raw, human emotions into the situation, adding a poignancy to this engrossing piece of cinema.",
            "Hard-hitting moments abound amid the slightly tangled plotting.",
            "The same story could have been set in any period, but set in an urgent contemporary world this is alive to the major moral conundrums contained in the everyday."

            "It's not hard to see the appeal of the Camino, in its simplicity and potential -- even if Smith's film can depict only aspects of the experience, and isn't able to explore its after-effects.",
            "Six travelers traverse hundreds of miles along Spain's famed Camino de Santiago by foot in Lydia B. Smith's genial documentary, which gradually reveals itself as part travelogue and part spiritual quest.",
            "The result is a travelogue with self-help bromides, or an Esalen workshop with blisters.",
            "Walking the Camino is easy on the ears as well as the eyes and inspiring to the soul. It may even prompt you to skip the subway and walk home from the theatre - the whole way.",
            "Though some of the pilgrims have deeper, more developed personalities than the average reality show contestant, their rough edges are smoothed out by the film's banal benevolence.",
            "Smith allows these people to speak their minds, and, as the journey progresses, the talk, not surprisingly, becomes increasingly depth-charged.",
            "The film is unquestionably 'feel good' cinema, but this does not mean it is devoid of challenge or reality. ",
            "Soulful, spiritual, invigorating, accepting, and so damn pretty, Walking the Camino feels like a warm hug on a sunny day.",
            "Walking the Camino makes me wish I could walk it today. It could be a promotional film for the Camino but I think it works even for people who are unable to make that 500-mile pilgrimage because we are all on a journey, we are never finished.",
            "As a film, it may lack both the documentarian's detachment and a overarching narrative concept... but there is no denying the heartfelt sincerity of the entire undertaking.",
            "The cast are well-selected and good company as they dish up bumper-sticker wisdom gleaned on the road...",
            "Walking the Camino works on a far broader level than just depicting a physical experience. It grapples with religion, personal growth and introspection, and does so with a humble curiosity that's indicative of the pilgrims themselves.",
            "Why they've decided to make this journey, whether they'll make it, and what it will mean when they get where they're going are questions that pull us along, every step of the way.",
            "[Smith] gets at the essential inward journey of most of her subjects, and she makes the concept of walking 800 kilometres seem remarkably appealing.",
            "It will nourish your mind, body and soul, and inspire you to embark on your own pilgrimage at some point in your life. ",
            "As travelogue, this is a persuasive introduction. Viewer beware: The impulse to take a hike is strong. Wear sturdy shoes.",
            "Driving both the filmmaker and her subjects is wonder and wanderlust. Their enthusiasm for the Camino is contagious ...",
            "\"Walking the Camino: Six Ways to Santiago\" may not be entirely brilliant, but it's at the very least inspiring.",
            "A documentary focusing on six pilgrims and their responses to this daunting and enlightening physical and spiritual journey.",
            "A lovely, gently resonant documentary that charts the journey of modern-day pilgrims as they take a 500-mile trek across the north of Spain.",
            "Relationships are formed, epiphanies occur, and all in all, each trekker finds some sense of accomplishment on the 500-mile walk to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela."

            "The disappointing aspect to Captain Phillips is that it doesn't go beyond action movie conventions.",
            "Over and over in this movie we hear variations on the phrase \"everything's going to be OK.\" It's just impossible to head out of the theater and back into the wider world believing that's actually true.",
            "We're in the steady hands of Paul Greengrass, a director fully aware that convincing crisis stories involve conflicting interests and passions.",
            "A ruthless, ripped-from-the-headlines seafaring thriller with a vintage turn from Tom Hanks.",
            "A film in which many exciting things happen on an actual working ship out in open water - and yet the movie is uncompelling.",
            "This is both Hanks's and Greengrass's best and sturdiest work in a decade; a film that feels less written, acted and shot than smelted, fused and riveted.",
            "Newcomer Barkhad Abdi, a Somali with no previous acting experience who beautifully captures both the desperate menace and the thoughtful humanity.",
            "Even though the ending is well known, the suspense is tangible, made through expert craftsmanship and authentic acting.",
            "Tom Hanks puts on one of the best performances of his career in Captain Phillips...",
            "Paul Greengrass assimilates the dramatic events of Captain Phillips, teaching us how modern pirates operate in these times with outstanding cinematic execution. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "There's too much waiting and overly dramatic reflection. But the film does finish with a thrilling flourish, and the details of the cat and mouse games at sea are quite riveting.",
            "Nothing feels false and in its final 30 minutes Captain Phillips is damned near perfect.",
            "Sadly, thanks to the Dutch film A Hijacking, which \"coincidentally\" hit DVD this week, Captain Phillips isn't even the best \"hijacked by Somali pirates\" movie in the last 6 months. ",
            "Mainstream films this good deserve to be celebrated, because they don't come along nearly as often as they should. ",
            "It's a compelling, ripped-from-the-headlines drama that offers plenty of tension -- even if you are familiar with the story.",
            "The Navy SEALS procedural is a bit of a jumble even as it comfortingly demonstrates American competence in the face of a standoff. Still, it's the captain's passion that gives the movie its emotional intensity.",
            "Hanks excels as Phillips with his everyman persona.",
            "What makes Captain Phillips so gripping, apart from its visceral sense of danger, is that it daringly gives us both points of view.",
            "Works as a reasonably effective thriller, although, in retrospect, that seems more down to the inherent strengths of the scenario than any brio in the storytelling itself.",
            "Director Paul Greengrass creates a compelling film that is engaging without being preachy or didactic. Tom Hanks is, as always, stellar; and first-time actor Barkhad Abdi is moving as the villain/victim of the story.",
            "Captain Phillips is a stupendous thrill ride that should not be missed. Hanks' performance alone makes it worth the price of admission, but Abdi and Greengrass sweeten the deal.",
            "Captain Phillips is a tense and taut thriller with exceptional acting from its leading men.",
            "My heart was in my mouth throughout. It is nail-bitingly exciting, even if you know the outcome, and I think I can safely say it's a better film than the one I thought I was going to see.",
            "It's a breath-taking cat-and-mouse thriller with a superb central performance from Tom Hanks as well as from newcomer Barkhad Abdi."

            "This tale of a creepy pedophilic relationship is the most tender, nuanced, and deeply felt picture Seidl has ever made.",
            "As thrillingly good equal to its sister films, Seidl tantalizes here by subverting our expectations based on his previous work, giving us a modestly sweet afterglow after we've gnawed our way through the sour and sublime.",
            "Far weaker than the two previous chapters, Hope gropes hopelessly for provocation, but instead finds only tedious, highfalutin banality.",
            "As a scalding film experience about modern womanhood and its discontents, it has no peer this year.",
            "Funny, tense conclusion to Seidl's provocative Paradise trilogy",
            "Seidl is one of the masters of \"happy-sad\" storytelling. This time, however, his world lacks structural and emotional clarity.",
            "Paradise: Hope quickly rights itself and becomes lighter, looser, and more sympathetically observed than anything Seidl has done previously, ending a grim trilogy on a brighter note than expected. ",
            "The third and final film in Ulrich Seidl's \"Paradise\" trilogy navigates a narrow space between tenderness and cruelty.",
            "'Hope' doesn't lead to anything in particular, and so all those patient takes and slow, observational moments amount to what, exactly? We can't help but feel that by comparison with..Paradise: Hope ends up somewhat toothless. ",
            "An overweight 13-year-old girl's exploration of her sexual yearnings while attending a \"diet camp.\"",
            "The lightest and best part of Ulrich Seidl's trilogy about three women chasing elusive rewards, the film concludes this often distancing enterprise on an uncharacteristically compassionate note.",
            "A disappointing conclusion to an ambitious project.",
            "Austrian weirdmeister Ulrich Seidl's sometimes grueling but consistently compelling Paradise trilogy concludes on a surprisingly wistful, tender note.",
            "A minimalist look at the confusions facing teens but especially at the struggle made by a middle-aged doctor against the demands of his own hormones.",
            "The film stands alone as a tender portrait of adolescence at its most vulnerable and how we manage to survive it, even when surrounded by predators and wolves.",
            "Even if Paradise is lost, this remains the trilogy's best film.",
            "It's a revealing, often bitterly funny study in embarrassment and disillusion.",
            "A languid slow-burner that builds into a bleak portrait of a troubled teen.",

            "A bromance-of-sorts that marches to an entirely different drum, Prince Avalanche has an organic, contemplative aura that proves an edifying tonic to the endless chest-beating that has become Hollywood's shorthand for the entire male experience.",
            "Movies don't get much quirkier than Prince Avalanche, a picture that's every bit as odd as its title, which I still don't get even after seeing the movie. Not that it matters. I did get the movie (I think), and grew to like it by the time it was over. ",
            "Prince Avalanche certainly seems like a step in the right direction, but it's too light and forgettable to really make any impact.",
            "It feels as though Gordon Green was never entirely sure what type of film he wanted to make, and so it remains something of an enigma; interesting and engaging, if never quite fulfilling",
            "Prince Avalanche would have made a fantastic short film, but as a feature, my only critique is that it seemed to drag a bit.",
            "One of Prince Avalanche's central problems comes from the contrast of David Wingo's ethereal, overly weighty score, which seems to attempt to elevate the bromance humour to a more profound level.",
            "Prince Avalanche has the pristine integrity of a movie that knows exactly what it wants to be -- and doesn't worry whether many or any will be eager to jump aboard.",

            "Chereau matches Conrad's insistence on psychological accuracy, burrowing through the protective layers of self-delusion that hold so many human relationships together.",

            "Both protagonists give elegant and moving performances.",
            "A film that matches all too well the times it portrays, Gabrielle is claustrophobic, stifling, and not a little crusty. Saved only by its exquisitely bitter performances and immaculate design.",

            "I was a bit skeptical when I first learned about Drinking Buddies, because I did not expect Wilde and her cohorts to be up for the task; thankfully, I was proven wrong, and the actors go places that I would never expect studio-seasoned actors to go.",
            "A beautifully observed dramedy about modern friendship and romance; funny, poignant, unforgettable.",
            "It finds its groove with sincere, nuanced performances and a realistic attitude to romance as refreshing as a fistful of Citra hops.",

            "\"Happy People\" seems to strain toward the notion that harsh nature makes for a pure heart. And perhaps it does for some. But all?",
            "Titling a documentary about snowbound Siberian fur trappers \"Happy People\" is not as ironic as it seems.",
            "It's not that Happy People is uninteresting... It's just that the one sensibility of which we were previously aware -- that of Herzog's -- is indiscernible, as if frozen beneath all this movie's ice.",
            "Herzog's longing for the ideological purity in which these lives are lived, free of paperwork and bureaucracy, taxes and technology, drives the film, which lacks an overall story arc.",
            "It's a do-it-yourself world that Herzog clearly admires - much of what we see is the men performing the tasks that enable them to survive.",
            "They decidedly don't seem happy. And \"Happy People's\" decision to skate down the frozen Yenisei without examining their unhappiness more closely leaves a slight chill.",
            "Although Happy People feels cobbled together, Herzog and Vasyukov do provide us with some pretty astounding images.",
            "Puts things in perspective, offering a welcome respite from a world of hustle and bustle that has become all too superficial.",
            "Herzog lends the golden touch that is his voice to the film, making the grueling, harsh winter landscape lyrical and poetic.",
            "Every documentary could use the Werner Herzog touch.",
            "Cut down from a four-hour documentary by Vasyukov, the result is a film lacking in catastrophic tragedies of any sort that holds you nonetheless with its raw view of lives spurning quotidian modern comforts with a vengeance.",
            "In a very real sense, we are watching Herzog watch this film, his rapturous reaction illuminating as much about himself as his subjects.",
            "Quirky and a little scary and rapturous all at the same time.",
            "Unmistakably part of the director's canon, and just as unmistakably a minor addition to it.",
            "A stirring meditation on the human spirit in extreme conditions, Happy People also reflects Herzog's passion and fascination for the often unforgiving nature of the wild.",
            "From Siberia, with Happiness",
            "It's a minor film from a major director but it's still a strong one for those interested in its subject matter - how people can still co-exist with and live off the land instead of ignoring or abusing it.",
            "Herzog ... continues his streak of well-crafted documentaries with surprising subjects.",
            "Albeit a found film of sorts, Happy People is very much of a piece with Herzog's other work, examining man's place in the natural world, looking at man's history and man's ability to survive, to endure.",
            "Primarily following one veteran sable trapper through his primitive but fascinating annual routine, the movie also features clouds of mosquitoes thick enough to inspire phantom itching in viewers.",
            "Herzog has become a master of the understatement - knowing just how long the images can sustain you without a word being said.",
            "The quality of the video, solid behind the camera work and the dedication of all involved (and the wonderful subjects) make this an uplifting happy story about \"Happy People.\" ",
            "Herzog is not insincere. His passion for outsize experience has always captured our essential human identity against big backdrops. He captures it again in \"Happy People,\" but this time with a twist.",
            "The film has a relaxed, matter-of-fact feel."

            "Despite its familiar genre trappings, this nastily efficient horror film delivers genuine chills.",
            "Come Out and Play is a good example of how to eke out film thrills with a minimum of elements. Makinov should prove to be a filmmaker to watch.",
            "The film maintains a deliberately unhurried pace that builds tension naturally and with minimum interference from the soundtrack.",
            "For horror fans, there are ... enough gruesome images, icky concepts and \"don't-go-there\" moments to carry the day.",
            "Even by the low standards of scary-movie plausibility, mononymous first-timer Makinov exhibits brazenly little interest in psychologically grounding his story.",
            "Makinov tries repeatedly to mine suspense from slowly creeping up on his actors with the camera. If I'd directed this bunk, I'd hide my face too.",
            "[Makinov] creates a craving within, tapping into the human nature of curiosity, begging you to Come Out And Play. But sadly, he never tells you why, leaving you frustrated and yearning for answers.",
            "The film loses its way once the stakes are raised, providing uninspired, generic fare without anything to invest in.",
            "Mostly just a hollow experience",
            "An unnerving, humid slice of elemental horror that conjures up memories of Children of the Corn by way of George Romero. It mostly works, until it doesn't.",
            "Occasionally creepy, but mostly inert, unimaginative and tedious. ",
            "Creepy, troubling idea drains away through a gaping plot hole",
            "These kids are not your usual tourist fare. Look out young marrieds!",
            "Makinov's film expertly crafts a sense of dawning madness that hinges on its villains' unspoken fury at their elders. ",
            "While I'd personally rather pop in Who Can Kill A Child?, viewers new to the subject will find Makinov's remake interesting, but they should know it's already been done before - and better.",
            "Though virtually without plot, the horror elements are effective given the graphic views of mass murder.",
            "A relentlessly routine remake.",
            "...a slightly uneven yet stirring horror effort that bodes well for the mysterious Makinov's future endeavors.",
            "Demands a little patience but also delivers some nasty chills in return.",
            "If anything, 'Come Out and Play' is generic to the core, a cut and paste horror thriller that still manages to deliver on both production value and intensity."

            "The Icelandic director Benedikt Erlingsson's debut feature is a wondrously strange affair, full of beautiful imagery of Icelandic horses set against rugged, frozen backdrops.",
            "A bracing, darkly funny series of interlocking tales in which equine behavior came off considerably better than that of humans...",
            "A laconic, lyrical script is peppered with subtle moments of absurdity to paint a twisted portrait of the director's homeland. Set against the picturesque, ashen vistas of the Icelandic landscape, Erlingsson constructs a dense and multifaceted drama.",

            "There's little dialogue, allowing us to marvel at the beauty of the setting and the absurdity of the human condition, set to music as eclectically used as in a Tarantino film",
            "Of Horses and Men is nothing if not memorable, and it matches its missteps with commendable and thoughtful formal and stylistic prowess.",
            "Icelandic director Benedikt Erlingsson's equine-accented debut is passionate and pleasing, yet remains somewhat culturally aloof.",
            "Little surprises, an Icelandic landscape, and its humbled inhabitants make up for an choppy story",
            "In the life force and in death, the two species coexist, complement and mirror one another.",

            "Think of this as a western of the far north - one with no bad guys, a few stunts and showdowns, and horses who share top billing with their riders.",
            "If you want to see the year's most original, comedic and shocking film all rolled into one, look no further than this feature from Iceland.",
            "One of the pleasures of this film is the extent to which the horses really do feel like part of the narrative.",
            "The tone veers from quirky observation to bleak contemplation, with a streak of dry cruelty - particularly when viewed through the reflective eyes of the horses upon which Erlingsson repeatedly focuses.",

            "[A] bizarre, offbeat Icelandic gem.",

            "For the casual but compelled moviegoer, The Desolation of Smaug is a fine improvement over the first offering. Tolkien aficionados may feel otherwise.",
            "Desolation of Smaug looks as dreary as the title would lead you to believe. The whole thing lingers in the memory as piles of sludge and ash.",
            "I'm not an aficionado of J.R.R. Tolkien's wonderworlds and I was bored with the first Hobbit movie. All this is by way of saying I quite liked its sequel and the second in the trilogy.",

            "The Desolation of Smaug is a definite improvement upon An Unexpected Journey. While I did like the first chapter, I am not above admitting it had its faults",
            "The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is a good fantasy adventure that is responsible for giving us a more visceral, visually amazing and entertaining film chapter than \"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\". [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Peter Jackson keeps The Hobbit franchise intact with this latest chapter! Fun, Fantastical and Fantabulous!",
            "The Desolation of Smaug is much better than its predecessor, and is one of the best films of the year. The special effects are magnificent; the work accomplished with the Smaug character is incredible. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "The Desolation of Smaug has a few beautiful moments, but...these two Hobbit films feel like one of those Star Wars spin-off novels where they take place in the same universe as the main storyline, but don't actually feel like a true part of it.",
            "The Desolation of Smaug doesn't disappoint. Despite its questionable plot lines and dialogue, it ticks the boxes as an action-packed, visually stunning feature. ",
            "While it's saddled with being the bridge between two other films, The Desolation of Smaug wholly succeeds where An Unexpected Journey did not in that it makes us look forward to the final installment. ",
            "Hobbit haters get dragon-forged coal for Christmas.",
            "The film is nothing short of a visual stunner.",
            " Formless, unwieldy, and ultimately disappointing.",

            "More reasons to watch: Benedict Cumberbatch doing the absolute most.",
            "The problem with a five (soon to be six) movie franchise is that there can't help but seem a touch of the law of diminishing returns by the latter episodes."

            "It is so baffling why Singer, a noted moviemaker with an adventurous eye for cinematic curiosity, was drawn to such an uneventful and spotty computerized kiddie caper. This swashbuckling escapist eggroll of a movie is all dismissive chatter and static ",

            "[A] fascinating but frustrating documentary ...",
            "The film is not without its flaws, but the story it tells is both terrifying and inspiring.",
            "The producer's hand is heavy in No Place on Earth, but it ultimately can't sink the inspiring tale of endurance.",
            "The movie is engaging but appallingly superficial when it considers the larger history of the Holocaust.",
            "The story told by Janet Tobias' documentary \"No Place on Earth\" is enough to transcend the film's limitations.",
            "While there's not much that sets No Place on Earth above a well constructed program one would see on the History Channel, it's a compelling tale from a horrific period of time.",
            "This film, while hardly being a masterpiece of cinema, has more than its share of gripping moments and emotional revelations.",
            "Janet Tobias has expertly crafted this tale of Jewish families in the western Ukraine fighting for their lives by ferreting underground and living for nearly a year and a half in dark, damp caves in the countryside. ",
            "This is the remarkable story of a few of Holocaust survivors who lived over 500 days in caves, coming out into the light only when the German army had been driven from the Ukraine.",
            "It plays out as a unique real-life adventure Holocaust story, that touches the heart strings.",
            "This is a nearly forgotten chapter of Holocaust history brought back to life by this documentary.",
            "A powerful true-life story gets a rather pedestrian treatment in this compelling documentary.",
            "No Place on Earth is a satisfying hybrid that allows another worthwhile glimpse into courage during times of horrible tragedy...",
            "An extraordinary combination of documentary and dramatization...a Holocaust film that's also a modern detective story.",
            "Perhaps too many reenactments, but nevertheless a moving tale of human endurance.",
            "None of my formal quibbles is meant to make light of this heroic story. Indeed, some chronicle is better than no chronicle, but the past exists only in the retelling; how history is written is as important as the story itself.",
            "It is joyous to see these people, then children, now old, in natural light, and it is extraordinary to see them return to the cave that sheltered them.",
            "There's a great book there, but \"No Place on Earth\" director Janet Tobias chose to fill the gaps in the story with lengthy, indifferently acted \"re-creations\" that lead us to question how much of what we're seeing is true and how much is fictionalized.",
            "There have been many films detailing horrific aspects of the Holocaust. \"No Place On Earth\" has a definite place in the ranks of the best.",
            "The final piece of the documentary may be the most startling of all. ",
            "The Holocaust-survival documentary is almost a clich\u00e9 at this point, but Janet Tobias' documentary provides yet another proof that there's a virtually infinite supply of such stories.",
            "In No Place on Earth, director Janet Tobias explores this profound discovery, shedding light on a incredible story of endurance.",
            "Add one more extraordinary survival tale to the canon of Holocaust documentaries: \"No Place on Earth.\""

            "It's a touching film and a fascinating glimpse into one of those couples you can't quite believe are still together.",

            "[An] exceptionally authentic and warm portrait of love and creativity amid the impoverished end of the New York art scene.",
            "Heinzerling chooses to focus on the couple and their art, but it unfolds too slowly and at times it feels like the film has a lack of focus, altering between showing us their art creations and their rocky relationship without a balance. ",
            "Charming, funny with a particular fondness that is moving to watch, it is not to be missed.",
            "Cutie and the Boxer is an often quiet, almost fragile piece of cinema that presents us with a spiky and unglamorous relationship, still full of love. It's a beautiful and humane documentary.",
            "An unexpected but fully welcome treat. It's a great look at how both relationships and the creative instinct evolve over a long time.",
            "[Heinzerling's] languorous explorations of the couple's chaotic home find the details of their sexual and intellectual intimacy in the debris of their relationship, the collected treasures and half finished, discarded fragments of ideas.",
            "A sly, subversive portrait of an artist finally finding her voice... and the 'genius' husband in whose shadow she has long lingered.",
            "The film (cough) paints a compelling portrait of a true eccentric with a vast gulf between his dreams and his powers.",
            "Noticed by Oscar voters, this offbeat documentary explores the life of two colourful artists who have an unusual marriage.",
            "Bifurcated biopic about a long-suffering wife who, against her better judgment, put her own career aspirations on hold for decades for the sake of an abusive, alcoholic artist who took her for granted. ",
            "The resulting portrait, of a marriage enduring through change, is funny and touching.",
            "The only way you'll get a more intimate view of a marriage than the one in Cutie and the Boxer is if you're in it and maybe not even then.",
            "There are plenty of eccentric couples in the art world, but few compare to Ushio and Noriko Shinohara, the fascinating pair at the centre of Cutie And The Boxer.",
            "It's a deeply affecting yet keen-eyed portrait of the struggles of art, love and life.",
            "Focused on the nitty-gritty reality of the creative life, as well as the people it holds captive and tortures, Cutie and the Boxer offers unprecedented insight into what makes an artist an artist.",
            "The viewer begins to wonder if this is a love story or a hate story -- or if there's a difference",
            "This works best as a portrait of a marriage, as Ushio and nimble wife Noriko rattle around their dank flat trying to keep the love strong as the water drips and the bailiffs thump."

            "It speaks to the courage and resilience of one man, the savagery of many, and the potential, for both good and for ill, in us all.",
            "McQueen depicts the horrific experiences of Solomon Northup, the free man kidnapped and sold into slavery, in utterly unflinching fashion. The film's strength lies in its frankness and avoidance of either sentimentality or Quentin Tarantino-style irony.",
            "In its own saintly manner, it's as exploitative as anything critics accused Django Unchained of being, minus Tarantino's eye for idiosyncrasy and sense of humor.",
            "The film tells an irresistibly powerful story, in a way that does not shirk the horror. It is unbearable to watch at times, but that is as it should be.",
            "A film that, despite its surface simplicity, proves to be riven with contradictions to the point of incoherence.",
            "Ejiofor projects extraordinary integrity, even nobility - and he holds the camera magnificently. It's a deeply inward, deeply felt performance, surely a cert for one of the many Oscars this film must win.",
            "It seems impossible to think of anyone turning in as fine a performance as Ejiofor does here.",
            "It may have taken its time to daunder down under, garnering plenty of awards buzz behind it, but late January finally saw Steve McQueen's impeccably crafted slavery epic hit our shores, and boy was the eventual Best Picture Oscar-winner worth the wait.",
            "An incredible story of a man who clung to the hope of returning to his family, and used it to push away the horrible world he was forced into. ",
            "I only have one word to describe 12 Years a Slave - masterpiece.",
            "The dramatic power of this film is an explicitly graphic and emotional material, in addition to working as an allegory towards racism and slavery, a cinema that is not afraid to express the shameful past of a nation. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "As McQueen's observant camera reminds us, we are all, in some insidious way, kin under the skin.",
            "Overall, 12 Years a Slave is a brave piece of filmmaking and one to last through the ages in terms of acting and storytelling. ",
            "12 Years a Slave occupies that sparsely inhabited place beyond Oscar statues and Tomatometer scores, in the upper stratosphere of movies that act as time machine and history professor. It is, for want of a better word, important.",
            "The film itself is beautiful. Each shot is pure artwork. Each note of music is pure emotion. Every cut is perfectly pieced together. Steve McQueen has assembled something that is great.",
            "Exquisitely built, so expertly acted and so fearlessly directed.",
            "It's an exhausting journey through one man's experiences being denied his humanity, a decade living as property. There's no lesson to be learned. If you need a movie to tell you that slavery is wrong, well, this movie isn't for you. No movie is.",
            "Too often have [slavery's] horrors been whitewashed in popular culture, but here at last McQueen lays them bare through the eyes and words of a man who experienced the unthinkable.",
            "12 Years A Slave is such a powerful film that it leaves you overwhelmed by the horror of its truth. It's a faithful adaptation of the real-life memoir of Solomon Northup.",
            "The definitive film on its subject matter.",
            "It is a brave piece that takes the uneasy subject and creates a superb piece of cinema. It is among the very best films of 2013.",
            "The performances are truly harrowing.",
            "There's a tyranny in McQueen's vision as he compels hero Solomon Northup on a vile trajectory of kidnap, brutality and dehumanisation.",
            "12 Years a Slave is for those who want to see Ejiofor's brilliance, believe that this history should be told so it will never be repeated -- and can bear to witness it interpreted for the screen."

            "By the time we get to Dallas for the big exam, we're so invested in these four funny, personable fellows that failure would be shattering for us too.",
            "Mildly suspenseful and informative, but occasionally repetitive and boring. You'll never look at a sommelier the same way again.",
            "We've seen these guys torture themselves so much, we inevitably get emotionally involved in the final verdict, and drinking to their success is what we'd all like to do.",
            "\"Somm,\" though an entree into a little-known world, rarely finds a second dimension.",

            "Though wrenching moments are effectively delivered, the film teeters into clunker territory, with repetitive tasting scenes and cheesy shots of exploding glasses of vino.",
            "It becomes about the drinker instead of the drink and, to be blunt, the drinkers in this film aren't interesting enough to justify its existence.",

            "An unexpectedly rich exploration of family bonds, blood rituals and the oftentimes zombie-like desire to assume the roles proscribed to each of us, played out with a sharp undertow of political allegory and darkly comic sensibility.",
            "Unfolding in an impoverished neighborhood in Mexico City, this disturbing debut paints social decay with bold, elegant strokes and dizzying camera angles.",
            "Grau's script is intelligent, and it has something to say about family and social dysfunction. You just might want to skip meat for a few days.",
            "Like zombie auteur George Romero at his best, Grau locks his sights on his social commentary of choice and goes after it with the zeal of a 19-year-old cannibal girl sinking an ax into the skull of her next meal.",
            "Grau effectively mixes wry, bloody, deadpan gags, family drama, and stomach-churning violence.",
            "The characters' rapacious tendencies exist in a void, so all we get is numbing, meaningless viscera.",
            "Deftly balancing a horror premise with the politics of a family drama, We Are What We Are is utterly refreshing.",
            "What could have been an intelligent rebirth for the cannibal genre... instead seems content simply to gorge, choke, and eventually suffocate on its own dullness and irrelevance.",
            "Strikingly original in technique, it pays no heed to the old masters of Mexican film; alluding only indirectly to present social conditions, it rewrites the horror genre with a premise that is outrageously novel.",
            "A competent barebones transfer of a horror film that deserves to win a wider audience among the Netflix crowd.",
            "Grau equates his cannibal family much like Tobe Hooper's Texas clan - as disenfranchised poor people living on the fringes of society struggling with their own familial power structure.",

            "Amid all the copycatting and pricey bombast and genericness, here's a movie that looks like it hails from a real place; whose characters sound like they come from somewhere; whose stakes are stresslessly low.",
            "The film is episodic and determinedly offbeat, funny at its best, boring at its worst.",
            "Some of the movie doesn't exactly convince, and some of the scenes have an actors-improv feel to them, but there's always plenty of humour and energy.",
            "Isn't cinema wonderful?",
            "The movie is unpolished, and it matters not a jot, because Leon has written super roles for these kids and invests their relationship with such sly feeling.",
            "Out of nowhere, Adam Leon might just have delivered the first great New York film of the decade.",
            "Gimme The Loot is about genuine friendship. It succeeds in that area even if the execution could have been improved.",
            "Keeping in tune with the youthfulness of his characters, and the exuberant elan of the \"ultimate crime\", [Adam] Leon shoots with a casual looseness that mirrors the essence of youth.",
            "Director Adam Leon probes the offbeat corners and rhythms of New York life. In doing so, he also subtly captures the textures of its society, language and hidden economies in a sweetly optimistic street romance.",
            "Gimme the Loot may scare off future visitors to New York City, but it'll certainly make those who grew up there homesick as hell.",
            "At once a breath of fresh air and nostalgically old skool, this toys with issues of race, class and gender but manages to wear its authenticity with an unusually light touch. ",
            "The duo's harmless, and ordinary thrill ride through the subway stations runs out of steam.",
            "A film brimming with so much life and mischief that it left me in an almost insufferably good mood for days afterwards. I didn't want it to end.",
            "Watching this film reminded me a bit of 'Friends,' the funny TV show where nothing ever happens. Here, there is a lot of activity, but nothing much is accomplished, except for the creation of a funny, entertaining movie.",
            "What gets this slight episodic film to first base is the likability shown by the non-professional leads.",
            "When the next American new wave rolls around, it'll be thanks to moments like these, and movies like Gimme the Loot.",
            "Full of ear-pleasing lines and obscure R&B tunes, it's colourful, casual and full of flavour. An unexpected treat.",
            "Every bit as charming and joyful as it is profane, affectionately portraying a slice of life that feels both exotic and recognizable.",
            "Has the mischievous energy and vivid sense of place that distinguished an earlier era of New York cinema...",
            "First-time feature director Adam Leon's shots are precise and full of detail.",
            "The film's strong suit is its use of locations.",
            "Shot on the streets of New York in a loose, freeform style, this lively comedy-drama feels somewhat underdeveloped, leaving us doubtful about its realism. ",
            "It's a great deal of fun, emotionally touching, and even surprisingly old-fashioned.",
            "Endlessly entertaining, refreshingly light-hearted and bursting with summer soul, Gimme The Loot joins the pantheon of great New York movies."

            "Distant and obvious, it takes a story with many angles and reduces its edges, becoming a glorified TV movie.",

            "The end credits song's beautifully delivered, full-throttle emotional bombast only serves as a dismaying reminder of how much the film otherwise lacks any similar passion and soul.",

            "Though Winnie Mandela is a more-than-serviceable classroom recounting of events, it fails to reach much higher than that, and deals with identity issues when deciding whether to challenge your views or simply glorify real-life events. ",
            "Sometimes it can be strangely said that it's a miracle when a certain film even exists, warts and all. So let's cut to the chase, and what really matters in this immensely important movie. Not the least which is, 'Strike a woman, and you strike a rock.'",
            "A warts-and-all biopic which focuses on its subject's childhood, college days and marriage while making short shrift of her transition into a war criminal.",

            "From the swelling melody on the soundtrack that opens the film to the Wind Beneath My Wings-like ballad that closes it, Winnie Mandela ... feels less like history come alive than Hollywood hagiography at its most blandly sentimental.",
            "ultimately too earnest for its own good",

            "TV-style biopic reduces South Africa's struggle to the status of an impediment in the blooming romance between Nelson Mandela and his wife Winnie."

            "There are just so many ways Carine Roitfeld can say she loves fashion in \"Mademoiselle C,\" a somewhat interesting documentary that brings us into the inner workings of a magazine, but harps a bit too much on her ideas of fashion and style.",
            "A lively but exasperatingly incurious and obsequious work about Carine Roitfeld, the former Vogue Paris editor-in-chief who quit the Cond\u00e9 Nast empire in 2011 to start her own publication called CR Fashion Book.",
            "Unfortunately, the film doesn't show its subject's creative process as much as that of her collaborators ...",
            "It's a film which treats its audience like beggars wallowing in the gutter.",
            "For fashion junkies, Mademoiselle C will be like five September issues of Vogue all rolled into one.",
            "As a distinctly not-insider ... I would have benefited more from a broader portrait of the woman herself, and how she became such a legend.",
            "Constant has resigned from constructing anything resembling a narrative arc with Mademoiselle C. It's so anecdotal that it feels like a music video highlight reel of the lives of fashion moguls.",
            "...hard to follow, relatively incoherent,...she is shown as a peripatetic presence, with seeming indefatigable energy. But she talks so much during the first hour that it becomes enormously annoying...",
            "High in gloss if not necessary insight, this is manna for fashion fans but a marginally slighter piece of work than The September Issue.",
            "Fantastic access, if minimal drama.",

            "It's to Carine Roitfeld's own credit and director Fabien Constant's funky and frenetic pacing that the doc feels neither like a corporate hagiography nor like mere fashionista masturbation material.",
            "As vanity projects go, this one's unusually well-made - as any portrait of an iconic stylist ought to be.",
            "Roitfeld seems constantly inspired by the prospect of pushing boundaries and expectations, and that, in turn, is inspiring to watch. ",
            "Mademoiselle C succeeds in showcasing the rarified entity that is Carine Roitfeld...but it's ultimately more of a fawning love letter than a nuanced profile of a woman who surely must be more fascinating than she comes off here.",
            "You never learn why, exactly, she deserves a feature-length portrait. \"Maybe people will get sick of me,\" Roitfeld muses. A little more than 90 minutes should do the trick.",
            "Instead of giving the viewer the satisfaction of watching a movie, this charming collection of incidents feels like flipping through a magazine with amusing Franglais quotations pulled."

            "This documentary, from Robert Stone, sets out to think the unthinkable and ask the unaskable: should we learn to stop worrying and love nuclear energy?",
            "Intelligent, possibly important, definitely counterintuitive -- but needs more reporting and context.",
            "The film's tone is boosterish, and the cursory treatment of the cost of a nuclear-based energy overhaul, or the viability of renewable energy, tends to arouse skepticism rather than allay it.",

            "Thoroughly engaging thanks to its strong editing and startling facts, but the film feels a little conceited thanks to its one-sided argument.",
            "The director paints a partisan picture, but offers an eloquent and effective challenge to orthodox eco-wisdom.",
            "An A-grade exercise in myth-busting...Consciously counter-intuitive, Pandora's Promise is a challenging, sober film that provides much food for thought as it dares to de-demonise nuclear power.",

            "The film's blatantly one-sided presentation undercuts the pro-nuclear argument more than any counterargument.",
            "Documentary filmmaker Robert Stone goes against the popular anti-nuke stance held by our society for many years and brings with him a bevy of anti-nuke turned pro-nuke environmentalists, activists and nuclear engineers.",
            "Pandora's Promise is a fascinating documentary about nuclear power that argues it is the true green energy. It would be hard to imagine a film more controversial than this one.",
            "Sure, it's a little one-sided, but so are most environmental films...Whether Stone sways you or not, you can afford to give 90 minutes toward setting the balance right.",
            "With glaciers melting, seas rising and superstorms in the wings, Pandora's Promise, despite its one-sided polemics, revives a desperately needed conversation.",
            "Documenting how five authors changed from anti- to pro-nuke energy stances, Stone is less persuasive at translating this logic into reality.",

            "Unfortunately, too many people confuse convincingly expressed belief with actual evidence about the true state of the world, and that's what Stone is banking on."

            "It is heartening to find a teen-oriented movie franchise as gritty as The Hunger Games. Even so, Catching Fire remains contradictory, caught in some nether world between nightmarish political allegory and adolescent escapism.",
            "This is Empire Strikes Back stuff. It has that second Star Wars movie's kick of confidence.",
            "Director Francis Lawrence's film runs nearly two-and-a-half hours but it concludes so abruptly and tantalizingly, it leaves you wanting more. ",
            "The budget is nearly twice the original, and it shows. Great work from the A-list cast, amazing set designs and costumes.",
            "Now the violence is not merely physical, but existential. Far from having won her freedom as promised, Katniss is now imprisoned in a false public narrative-supporter of the Capitol, lover of Peeta-from which she may never escape. ",
            "Catching Fire delivers on the grim, roiling promises of the original. ",
            "An entertaining and thought-provoking film that proves we have a right to expect much more from even a good old-fashioned Hollywood popcorn flick.",
            "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is epic, filled with fantastic performances, great visual effects and a story that surpasses the first film in EVERY department.",
            "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire digs much deeper than the first installment and the result is a much stronger movie. ",
            "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire lights the fuse of this franchise in a more provocative way than its predecessor. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "The story is more complex, and director Francis Lawrence did an even better job of integrating taut action and convincing special effects into a developing plot...",
            "Bigger, darker and more allegorical than ever, with Catching Fire, Frances Lawrence excels with visual splendor and the creation of the island where the Quarter Quell Games are held. ",
            "The time and effort gone into Catching Fire does not go without notice.",
            "Exciting, engaging and overall better than The Hunger Games, Catching Fire escapes being labelled as the 'dreaded sequel'.",
            "The Hunger Games franchise is escapism and a wake-up call all at once, and Catching Fire rings that bell loud.",
            "No one does both vulnerability, determination and strength better than Jennifer Lawrence.",
            "What sets The Hunger Games apart from other blockbusters of its type is how it doesn't use its violence as a crutch. It actually makes us feel the loss of its victims.",
            "Nevertheless, the film and franchise will always thrive thanks to their phenomenal leading lady.",
            "Francis Lawrence nicely balances stunts and spectacle with the growth of Katniss, who goes from teenaged girl to young woman with a wider worldview.",
            "Despite sharing a similar narrative structure with the first film, Catching Fire ups the ante and heightens every element of the storytelling, from the drama to the stakes to the performances to the action.",
            "The film's visual spectacle is still impressive, with a story that delves a little more into social disparity and class struggle... But the heartbeat of \"Catching Fire\" -- and the franchise in general -- remains Lawrence.",
            "Such lofty dystopian concepts are certainly nothing new, but as with the first Hunger Games, there aren't many blockbuster sequels with half the guile, half the wit or half the heart of what we're treated to here.",
            "Directed by Francis Lawrence, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire satisfies and yet again leaves me wanting more.",
            "It has far too many denouements for your average action-heavy film, but every one of them is important in laying ground for what's to come."

            "Ashes is joyous and uplifting, full of spirit, memorable athletes (including Olympian Adrien Niyonshuti) and remarkable achievements, both big and small.",
            "Though the subject inspires, Johnstone's treatment lacks focus and edge, falling back on platitudes, sentiment, and generalities when clarity is what is needed.",
            "TC Johnstone's cycling documentary might sound at first like just another sport movie trying hard to seem inspirational, yet this study of the story behind 'Team Rwanda' is indeed just that.",
            "It's hard not to get swept up in this film's sense of hope.",
            "Inspiring, tough-hearted documentary about the formation of the Rwandan cycling team in the wake of the 1994 genocide.",
            "We're invited to bask in the achievements of Team Rwanda, but it's difficult to when confronted with the lingering intrigue surrounding Boyer's story.",
            "So while the subjects explored in Rising from Ashes are worthy of contemplation, the methodology of doing so puts the brakes on the film's ability to inspire and persuade.",
            "The race footage is everything a cycling addict, or even a casual admirer, could hope for.",
            "File it under the subgenre 'feel-good documentary.' Rising from Ashes is simple, direct and ultimately uplifting.",
            "A few gaps in the narrative do little to tarnish the impact of this stirring tale, which offers big heart and quick feet to those in the mood for a story that reinforces the power of the human spirit.",

            "The sincerity and simplicity of the film ... lift it somewhat above the ordinary run.",
            "A film that lacks complex human dimension to fill out this likable if promotional tale of good will and achievement. ",
            "Its story line is as positive and affirmative as the title indicates, but it turns out there are dramas going on in this documentary that you wouldn't initially suspect.",
            "...the story behind Rising from Ashes is so moving and compelling that the documentary's shortcomings seem inconsequential.",
            "Rising From Ashes, a film produced by Project Rwanda and funded by its donors, is little more than an 82-minute fundraising pitch.",
            "Sports provide a path for redemption for both athletes and coaches in Rising From Ashes, a documentary whose power is diminished by uneven storytelling.",
            "Rising from Ashes is not just about a cycling team; it's a testament to what happens when human beings care for one another.",

            "In this unsatisfying home movie meets documentary hybrid, filmmaker and father Jeremy Seifert seeks to convey the potential danger of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in our foods and the need for legislation requiring accurate labeling of such.",
            "The real truth is that GMO OMG...is merely the latest in a long line of one-sided agitprop documentaries. Far from an impartial investigation...Seifert's work is a monotonous censure that, in the absence of conclusive data, exploits fear.",
            "Smart animation and a series of powerfully provocative statistics punctuate the film, and while familiar it is still a subject that needs to be focused on.",
            "Combines the folksy charm of Taggart Siegel's The Real Dirt on Farmer John and the frightening facts of Robert Kenner's Food, Inc.",
            "Insufferably certain of its own charm and a lot less interested in educating viewers than it purports to be, Jeremy Seifert's GMO OMG offers an introduction to genetically modified food that is only slightly more thoughtful than the movie's title."

            "But if a certain sentimentality means that there is a little too much included, the film also benefits from the obvious emotion that the contributors all pour into it.",

            "The songs performed here function as the creative end point of emotional trauma, revealing pain gradually transfigured into art.",
            "A lyrical ballad on an intimate scale but international in scope."

            "The doc is unapologetically one-sided, and spends more time canonizing Abu-Jamal than exploring the murder and trial themselves.",

            "A perfect storm of perversity, pre-Persona identity transference, prole pole-positioning and mutually assured psychological destruction, Joseph Losey's masterpiece immediately transformed the director from has-been Hollywood exile to European auteur.",

            "The Servant summons up all one's irrational fears and its baroquely sinister atmosphere invests the most ordinary event with middle-of-the-night creepiness.",

            "The transformation of behaviour from seedy man- servant to slatternly, domineering wife is brilliantly handled by Losey and Dirk Bogarde, an actor whose work has always gone beyond the call of duty in a long line of undistinguished films.",

            "As technically complicated as this process is, especially with non-fiction material, Benicheti made it appear effortless.",

            "The viewing experience is immersive and magical as the late filmmaker Dominique Benicheti, a film academic who had taught at Harvard and had a deep interest in technical advances for cinema, insisted upon his work being seen under maximum conditions.",
            "An unabashed ode to the French countryside, Cousin Jules immerses the audience in mundane tasks that are transformed into unaccountably pleasing, tranquil ones.",
            "Shooting in color and widescreen, Benicheti makes images that are as poised and attentive as are his subjects.",
            "Approaching his lifestyle with ambivalence, the film still accords Jules enormous respect, showing an almost holy appreciation for the beautiful process of his blacksmithing work."

            "This infuriating documentary by Dylan Mohan Gray chronicles the long battle to make generic ARVs available to poor African countries, which big pharma resisted because cheap drugs would undermine their bloated pricing here in the U.S.",

            "Low-cost generic drugs are as safe and effective as the criminally expensive branded ones. And all human life is sacred. This is the clear message from Fire In The Blood, and it bears telling. And re-telling.",
            "An essential watch that is laden with information, what is admirable about Fire in the Blood is Gray's decision to not take a political slant-an easy, obvious approach-allowing the story to speak for itself purely from a humanitarian angle.",
            "Upsetting, poignant, infuriating... it shows the very worst of humanity - how privileged people in the West simply just didn't give a damn about millions upon millions of people dying in Africa. This is compulsory watching.",

            "Watch the film if and when you can. Hopefully the information in this film will reach the masses and the disgust at the situation, still ongoing, will prompt true change.",
            "It produces a collection of one-dimensional facts strung together with an utmost respect for chronology and documentary-making's most stale conventions.",

            "It's a pleasant-enough movie, but offers little that the book doesn't give its readers; far too quickly, it fades away.",
            "Remarkably, the story, adapted by Blume with her son, director Lawrence Blume, seems as fresh, painful and poignant as when she wrote it.",
            "There are no surprises among the characters - depressed mom (Amy Jo Johnson), controlling aunt (Cynthia Stevenson), new boyfriend (Tatanka Means) - but the cast is strong enough to build on familiar elements.",
            "Time has robbed Blume's subjects of shock value, but her perceptiveness hasn't dimmed. The movie's sincerity carries it along, and makes this story endearing despite its filmmaking clich\u00e9s.",
            "This attenuated coming-of-age tale oozes heart and perhaps too much respect for its source material.",
            "A gentle, honest and shrewdly realized film ... It's worth seeking out.",
            "...scants the rich emotional potential in favor of After School Special cliches",

            "Tender, well-acted teen drama is true to classic Blume book.",
            "A leaden, rushed movie, with Blume's own son responsible for mucking with the nuances of the source material, flattening promising conflicts and painful introspection. ",
            "Tiger Eyes takes youth angst to another level in this page to screen adaptation. Touching on teen alcoholism and pregnancy, atom bombs, and aboriginal life in Los Alamos. ",
            "Warm, poignant and family-friendly with a rushed, contrived ending.",
            "Directed and constructed without distinction; nevertheless, it is quite moving, thanks to Blume's storytelling and the sincerity of the performances.",
            "Tiger Eyes retains some of the seriousness and respect for character that distinguishes Blume's YA books. What it lacks, however, is her strong authorial voice.",
            "Cheaply made, for just over two million dollars, Tiger Eyes looks under-populated, even for its Southwestern milieu, with the feel of a made-for-TV movie, not an indie film, which is how it's being promoted.",
            "Catnip for the bookish emo demo.",
            "[Tiger Eyes has] an uncommon intimacy, the kind you find in a Judy Blume novel. Her grit and grace are all over this heartfelt adventure of a movie. She gives it a spirit that soars.",
            "A moving depiction of a teenage girl's quest for a way out of her sadness, grief, and loss over the sudden death of her beloved father. ",
            "Laughably, amateurishly, and Hallmark-Movie-Channel bad.",
            "A lean, economically told indie that should please fans of the 1981 source novel.",
            "Still waiting on that Superfudge movie.",
            "In the end, it represents a solid blueprint for a later, better Blume adaptation, but that's hardly anything to scoff at."

            "This Is Martin Bonner explores what it means to be a good person at a crossroads, and whom you might find there.",
            "The rare contemporary film about Christian behavior that doesn't go out of its way to announce its secularity, it's equally unpatronizing in its sharp articulation of loneliness in middle age and beyond.",

            "Full of songs from both Buckleys, the film, directed by Daniel Algrant, underplays the daddy-issue cliches while also staying away from a typical biopic structure- after all, it ends before Jeff Buckley even got famous. ",

            "Just as the plot threatens to run out of gas, Lin rescues the film with a spate of vastly ridiculous and therefore enjoyable set-pieces, most of which involve means of conveyance designed to make the cars look puny.",
            "Exists purely to showcase how idiotically over-the-top action sequences can become when annoyances like gravity are tossed to the side.",
            "Some of the action sequences are insane. No, really. Absurd, impossible, physics defying, triage-required stuff. No matter. That's the foolish rush of a franchise that must go faster and faster and furiouser and furiouser.",
            "How you feel about \"Fast & Furious 6\" is a matter of perspective.",
            "Ludicrous, but undeniably fun and surprisingly affectionate, this is really all you could ask of a car crash movie, and more.",
            "Furious Six continues on in the same vein as its predecessor, and may just be my favorite of the lot.",
            "Lin has really amped up the unbelievable factor here with some of the action sequences.",
            "Fast & Furious 6 is just as fun and exciting as the previous entries.",
            "Turn off the ignition in your head, then throttle up all other senses, and you will feel the rush of this guilty-pleasure joy ride to the max.",
            "Action-packed and ridiculously fun, it is hard not to cheer during Fast & Furious 6. ",
            "The latest in what has essentially become the James Bond for gearheads franchise embraces its inner goofiness -- so over the top that you can't help but be entertained. ",
            "Offering more of the high-octane action that the series is famous for, Lin's Fast & Furious 6 is easily the most ridiculous blockbuster of 2013 thus far; and also one of the most watchable. ",
            "Lin and Company generally know what they're doing, particularly exploiting the fun of having Diesel and Johnson appear together and play off each other, as Dom and Hobbs try to out-tough one another.",
            "Excels at deepening the characters while also tying together multiple threads from previous films in a way that feels fulfilling.",
            "Fast & Furious 6 is the culmination of the last five films and it's jam-packed with non-stop excitement.",
            "This series is not about logistic possibilities. It's about taking it to 11, and Furious 6 does just that once again. If you enjoyed the direction of Fast Five, you are in good hands here.",
            "Even non-fans will get a thrill or two, followed by a quick laugh and a feeling like someone is trying to insult their intelligence.",
            "Sleek and fine-tuned, these movies do exactly what they say on the bodywork.",
            "And while director Justin Lin's eye for the flamboyant makes the film less credible, it's never not fun to watch even as you shake your head at the absolutely bogus action scenes.",
            "Contain your excitement: this is a London populated by monodimensional toffee noses or thick necks and, while it's good to have the no-nonsense [Michelle] Rodriguez back, she's soon crowded out by dreary ex-models and wisecracking dipsticks.",
            "As long as 'let it go, bro' is your mantra, you'll have a fine time at Fast and Furious 6.",
            "There's still some gas left in the tank here.",
            "Nobody goes to these movies for dialogue. And maybe that's true - but that doesn't mean they have to be written like a bunch of third graders playing \"movie\" in the school yard.",
            "Diesel's mega-bass voice and the slo-mo charisma with which he delivers those bass lines have resulted in a series that got more popular in its fifth and sixth installments."

            "The insightful contrasts within the aggregate picture make up for the film's leisurely pace and lack of narrative propulsion.",

            "More than some run-of-the-mill social-awareness doc, the film pays as much attention to the personal and emotional strife of its subjects as it does to their activism. "

            "I found myself asking, \"And so why am I being retold this hoary tale?\"",
            "As iffy as the coulda-been premise is, \"Downloaded\" is still a vigorous retelling of Fanning's and Parker's wildfire achievement and its ethical pitfalls ...",
            "Winter can't get his arms around his material. He seems reluctant to pare anything, and his talking techie heads - Napster founders Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker, along with a host of others - often make the same points, one after another.",
            "An independent Napster may be gone, but its impact reverberates, not least in the continuing threat to intellectual property.",
            "Director Alex Winter tracks the evolution of our tunes, and current glimpses of Fanning, especially, show how small revolutions can have larger, often disturbing, soundwaves.",
            "Narrated entirely through personal testimony, we're given a rounded perspective of the case, both by the people that supported Napster and [those] that fought against it.",
            "The film makes a convincing case that Napster was not just a delinquent site for music theft, but the progenitor of what we now call social media. ",
            "Downloaded provides a robustly engaging overview of Napster's renegade birth and premature death rattle.",
            "Has a sharp pace that burns through the years, but there isn't much here that's new, with revelations minimal at best. Fanning continues to be a question mark.",
            "Downloaded often misses bigger picture viewpoints, and mostly sticks with the standard narrative about Napster we all know (though with a bit more behind-the-scenes detail).",
            "Well-made and provides a largely accurate overview of this crucial chapter in the history of both music and technology.",
            "Compelling, provocative and well-edited. ",
            "The doc is only about as revealing as a middling magazine article on the subject. But it will fascinate and frustrate anyone already interested ..."

            "The movie is a bit of a puzzle coming from atheist co-writer Steve Coogan and the script grapples with these big questions of religion, class, and justice in a way that's far beyond the typical teary human-interest story.",
            "What at first seems formulaic comedy gains a deeper resonance as we see how they represent two responses to cruelty and injustice -- first outrage, and with time, eventually, forgiveness.",
            "It's smart and unsweetened. ",
            "Even as Philomena embraces the expected feel-good dynamics, it avoids taking the usual path and doesn't paint all of the \"evil\" nuns with the same brush.",
            "Solving this mystery is not nearly as engrossing as watching the actors' pas de deux.",
            "We wouldn't care about any of this if the performances were weak. But both actors find complexity and depth.",
            "It features a deeply felt and gripping performance from Judi Dench.",
            "Besides Dench's fierce eyes, the most interesting part of Philomena is watching the picture of the lost son unfold as the buddy-cop pairing of Dench and Coogan ferret out his life story.",
            "[A] story that took a lifetime, will now touch your heart for a lifetime.",
            "It's intelligently written and genuinely performed, even if the film is rather visually banal.",
            "Philomena is kind of a tough sell. It's not a feel-good holiday picture or a tour-de-force acting showcase destined to be christened with Oscar kisses. All the movie has to offer is the fact that it's really, really good.",
            "Director Stephen Frears overplays his hand occasionally, but the film is balanced by some fine performances and a delicate script by Coogan. ",
            "Surprisingly harrowing at times, the film avoids becoming an overwrought melodrama through the balance in characterisation between Martin's cynicism and Philomena's faith.",
            "Ultimately, Philomena is a film about faith, family and and forgiveness, making it perfect holiday viewing.",
            "The film's tone is bittersweet, with Philomena's deep-seated regret propelling the duo's journey forward at a gentle glide.",
            "Philomena is another Oscar-nominated film which features an older woman, and it left me frustrated...",
            "Give Dame Judi the damn Oscar",
            "Dench is undoubtedly Philomena's shining light, pouring warmth and heart into the film's remorse-racked heroine. Unfortunately, however, neither Coogan nor his script prove anything like her equals.",
            "Because the tale is so inherently emotional with its subject matter, all you need is a competent director and a couple of crack actors to wheedle that trajectory out.",
            "Philomena encompasses so much so adroitly -- it really is a remarkable story -- that we can admire its structure as a film, even as we absorb its sometimes startling facts and as we truly feel for its people. ",
            "The humor is forced and awkward, and the film struggles with the message it is trying to send. ",
            "It is quiet, restrained, unfussy, and has, at its heart, an injustice so grave it will make your blood boil. You will also cry. ",
            "Bittersweet and smart, Philomena is a character piece that carefully weaves in ugly parts of American and Irish history, a story that's as much about hatred and misused power as it is about faith and forgiveness.",
            "Philomena is the surprise hit of the season."

            "It's hard to make out what, if anything, writer-director Eric England is trying to say about the fragility of the flesh with Contracted, which amounts to little more than a slow-motion replay of The Fly's central gross-out.",
            "Contracted does for sex what Jaws did for beaches, let's just leave it at that.",
            "England supplies a sly, very cool denouement that suggests his intention was to craft a smart take on the most popular horror sub-genre at present.",
            "Icky and violent and shocking, but Contracted is also smart, insightful, and sort of tragic.",
            "Ultimately disappointing due to an inane script which fashions a thoroughly unlikable, idiotic protagonist who invites derision more than sympathy.",
            "sets its heroine's personal dramas against the spiralling symptomatology of her infection, fusing psychological insights with full-on body horror, leading towards an ending that is also a new beginning in this young woman's metamorphosis. "

            "A cult classic of the highest order, Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead is the rare 80&#8242;s movie that actually feels worthy of its lofty reputation; relatively, anyway.",
            "Sam Raimi's visceral debut remains a benchmark of modern horror.",
            "It's Raimi's keen eye (and ear) for audiovisual intoxication that makes this creeper a home run.",

            "[About Time] is less a rom com than a family drama and though it loses its way in the middle, it is when Curtis allows these familial ties to shine that the film comes into its own.",
            "Even in a work of science fiction like this, Gleeson seems beyond real. All those foam-faces being made in the dark? They're for him.",
            "Some people will revel in this warm front of innocence; others will reach for their Voltaire.",
            "There's a lot of comic and fantasy potential here, but much of it gets squandered.",
            "To get to the parts that are un-terrible, you have to suffer through the most idiotic plot developments and ill-defined characters imaginable.",
            "You may as well check your cynicism at the door, because Curtis & Co. are going to find a way to trample all over it - adorably.",
            "Even if the film is guilty of sometimes getting too sweet for its own good, a genuinely moving closing act excuses the excess sugar.",
            "It was about time it ended.",
            "I had some many problems with this movie.",
            "...one of the ways in which the filmmaker defuses the questionable gender politics of his primary love relationship is by widening the focus of his movie...",
            "It's a feel-good film about family relationships and how much you should cherish every moment you get with your loved ones.",
            "About Time is inevitably moving stuff; a sci-fi for those who like a spoonful of sugar to help the paradoxes go down.",
            "About Time is sweet, wistful and diverting, but a bit insubstantial when it comes to romance. It's most satisfying when it focuses on the love between parent and child. If this is your sort of love story, it's a good one. ",
            "Predictably, About Time has its saccharine-coated moments along with some bouts of flimsy feel-good pithiness attached...a few notches above the limited synthetic romantic time travel tales floating around aimlessly. ",
            "It's not earth-shattering, but it is a witty, entertaining, and touching story.",
            "Try as I might, and I did try, I just could not find it interesting or affecting, in any way.",
            "The relationships in the film are genuine, the banter witty, and the ending is sure to pull on your heartstrings.",
            "The script is dull, the characters are annoying and Curtis has reached deep into the bargain bucket of plot devices and come up with time travel, the Ford Cortina of twists.",
            "Ultimately, the message is simple and visceral enough to have crossover appeal. Give it a shot if romantic comedies float your boat.",
            "[About Time] has all the right cues to make you laugh, and cry. Unfortunately, it will also have you glancing at your watch wondering when time will be up.",
            "The film is an overly long attempt for its lead character to create the picturebook life of his dreams.",
            "Not surprisingly, writer-director Richard Curtis (Love Actually) clocks in more than just the standard romantic comedy with his latest feature (and reportedly last as a director), About Time.",
            " If you have ever entertained the possibility of swimming against the current of your own time stream and remaking key choices therein, then you've likely put more thought into this premise than Curtis did. ",
            "Young love provides the framework for About Time, the latest movie from writer-director Richard Curtis. But the heart of the film is a story about a boy, his father and the greatest gift they can give each other: their time."

            "Fueled by implausibility, and for a good portion of the ride much better for it, Bong-Joon Ho's Snowpiercer posits a nonstop, Earth-encircling train containing the microcosmic survivors of a society killed off by a global warming-induced deep freeze.",

            "Insanely brilliant.",
            "It has plenty of action, while the story contains an unexpected intelligence. It has a message, but never gets too preachy. It's very violent, yet avoids being overly bloody. It's dark, but knows when to lighten the mood.",
            "Bleak and grim and almost desolate, there is a spark of hope, just enough to keep the gloom and doom from becoming oppressive.",

            "...an extremely visceral experience, with much to say about contemporary western society. We couldn't expect anything less from Bong. [Full review in Spanish]",

            "[P]ierces the senses with Oscar-worthy stylization and performances while opening the eyes to a clarity of thought about the world around us.",
            "It was the end of times, it was the worst of times, and one of the best of times you'll have in the theater this year.",
            "I'm not saying that the impoverished are going to grab axes and violently murder the wealthy elite. But I'm also not NOT saying that...",
            "Snowpiercer has action, heart, a sense of humor, and a powerful message. The cast is talented and diverse. (...) It's the kind of genre movie the world needs more of. ",
            "A totally unique, delightfully weird romp that offers a spark of imagination that is sorely lacking in so many of our summer movies. ",
            "Snowpiercer may not be the masterpiece that people were hoping for, but that shouldn't take away from the fact that it's a hell of a fun ride.",
            "While not quite the artistic masterpiece that fans of the post-apocalyptic have been hailing it, Snowpiercer is still a thrilling, intriguing, blackly humorous and sometimes horrifying ride through the best and worst that humanity has to offer.",
            "By the time the end is upon you, and the twists are revealing themselves like falling dominos, it is hard to catch a breath."

            "Peirce wants to make a hit, and, even with source material this strange, it feels as though she has. But if so, that's all she has made.",
            "It looks uncannily at home in 2013.",
            "This glossy modern horror refit is a pale shadow of Brian De Palma's seminal 1976 film.",
            "Moretz replicates Laurie's pixie-featured Medusa gaze while Moore does the Spacek flayed-skull look.",
            "What the movie loses in kicky sensationalism, it sometimes gains in psychological nuance.",
            "The result is efficient, but only tentatively updated to the digital age of cyberbullying and social media, and it is strangely pointless.",
            "Kimberly Peirce takes a classic film and manages to be both faithful to the original while breathing new life into it.",
            "Why a new version? Why a remake? Why a reimagination? The answer is because this new 2013 Carrie from director Kimberly Peirce is just that - a reimagination that harkens back to the original source material - [Stephen] King's novel.",
            "Moretz plays Carrie as either a constantly petrified, meek outcast or a grimacing destroyer. Peirce fails to build a connection between audience and protagonist.",
            "While this quality remake will never be regarded in the same way, it achieves all the right shocks in a majorly unsettling way.",
            "The ambition of Peirce, Moretz, and Moore shines through in the film's strongest moments, and though the supporting players and shaky contemporary revisions weigh the film down, Peirce deserves credit for putting up one hell of a fight.",
            "This is a film that is all about the iconic prom sequence, which is staged well by director Kimberly Peirce, but there really isn't much more to the film.",
            "Pulls off the unenviable task of being both respectful to the original whilst spicing the story with enough fresh twists that it doesn't appear like a scene-by-scene retread of its forebear.",
            "There are a lot of good things here: the updates Pierce added make perfect sense, I really loved the special F/X, the score is AMAZING, and the casting is gorgeous. ",
            "There is no way for this Carrie to become a classic -- it is far too close to the earlier film to escape its shadow. However, it works perfectly well and is worth seeing, except for those who abhor the whole notion of remakes. ",
            "A near word-for-word remake... Kimberly Peirce's version of Carrie is an unnecessary update with its own charm nonetheless (and 100 percent less full-frontal nudity, thankfully).",
            "It is certainly asking a lot to buy into the shoddy remake of Brian De Palma's 1976 macabre masterpiece Carrie. There needed to be more shock-inducing significance poured onto this callow Carrie besides the standby bucket of pig's blood ",
            "Watching the remake of Carrie [over the original] is like replacing your phone with a newer version of the exact same phone.",
            "Director Kimberly Peirce delivers a worthy remake to a horror classic, while offering enough changes to make it seem fairly fresh.",
            "While [Chloe Grace Moretz] makes a believable prom queen swan, she's less convincing as an awkward ugly duckling.",
            "Whilst the kills and gore were mildly entertaining it was incredibly hard to sympathise with a Carrie that was fully aware of her powers and using them in violent ways as opposed to the... unaware Carrie Sissy Spacek gave us in the original.",
            "An efficient, yet prosaic supernatural thriller that does its best to rework the story to fit in with modern day audiences.",
            "Many scenes are similar to the 1976 original but this update feels far more like a Mean Girls high school flick, which is actually a good thing.",
            "It's good, gripping stuff: Moore is excellent as the pale and bedraggled cult escapee, and the storyline actually makes sense this time, with the help of some technology-assisted slut-shaming."

            "Bridges (gorgeous and effortlessly leftfield) has saved many a dire film. He tries to hold the fort but it just can't be done.",
            "[A] goofy and derivative supernatural action-adventure, based on a comic-book series by Peter Lenkov.",
            "So generic a cut-and-paste job is the film's every aesthetic cue, it's surprising to even find a director's name surface in the closing credits.",
            "It's billed as a supernatural action-adventure comedy, but its laughs are almost non-existent, its action depends on seen-it-all-before CGI trickery and much of its plot defies comprehension.",
            "I watched this movie with three chatty strangers on [a] Thursday night in an otherwise empty theater. Universal couldn't say \"no.\" Looks like that's our job now.",
            "It's a paint-by-numbers approach in which the film's comedy and drama both fall flat.",
            "Admit it. It even sounds stale. ",
            "Starts very solidly, but goes very soft by the end.",
            "It is among the worst examples of what comics on film have left us over the years. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "R.I.P.D. is a movie that suffers from a passel of lost opportunities.",
            "Based on a comic book that literally had to be better, writers Phil Hay, Matt Manfredi and David Dobkin did director Robert Schwentke no favors, but Schwentke directed The Time Traveler's Wife, so he had it coming.",
            "R.I.P.D. tries desperately to capture the same blend of action and comedy that worked so well in the \"Men in Black\" series, but the film only proves how difficult that balance really is.",
            "The actual conceit of hunting down the dead might have played better if the film weren't clearly trying to rip-off Men in Black in the most unambiguous way possible.",
            "To call R.IP.D. \"cartoonish\" is probably a compliment... but it's not quite fun enough for these four excellent actors to justify taking the money.",
            "Watching R.I.P.D., the unfamiliar viewer is given the distinct impression that this movie is probably an entertaining graphic novel -- but it's a terrible film.",
            "The performances are also fun, even if the story is derivative and the special effects look to be photo-shopped at a K-mart. ",
            "The chase scenes and special effects are great, or at least much better than I anticipated.",
            "Please, please don't see it. Value your time more than I did.",
            "What we are left with is a mildly entertaining, utterly harmless mid-summer blockbuster that marks another misstep in the career of Ryan Reynolds.",
            "Bake a 'Men In Black' pie; throw in some 'Ghostbusters,' 'This Is the End,' 'True Grit,' and 'Weeds,' drain the fun out, and you get the half-baked, derivative 'R.I.P.D.'",
            "The kind of terrible that doesn't wash out, destined to be remembered among the pantheon of big budget bombs like \"The Adventures Of Pluto Nash\" and \"Cutthroat Island.\"",
            "It's not a buddy-cop movie, nor is it an action movie. It's just one vaguely funny joke told for 98 minutes.",
            "It's a predictable and clich\u00e9 filled soap opera mess played straight with an afterlife gimmick.",
            "a film so preoccupied with style, (the stars) wander around the film without anything of note to do"

            "Christliness has always been an element of the Superman myth. But this film's near literal insistence upon it becomes absurd since director Zack Snyder and screenwriter David S. Goyer don't dramatize the analogy, they presume it.",
            "No fun costume change in a phone booth, no wowing humans with his powers and no repartee with reporter Lois Lane.",
            "The movie consists of endless declamation, endless violence.",
            "There's very little humor or joy in this Superman story.",
            "There's plenty to like in Snyder's hectic, rowdy film. But by the time we reach the bludgeoning excesses of the last half-hour it's hard to shake the sense that this was an opportunity at least partially missed.",
            "Cavill broods handsomely as Superman, but this reboot skimps on fun and romance.",
            "A reminder that it takes a whole lot more than muscle and strength to make a true superhero. ",
            "Zack Snyder makes his film feel more human, more emotional and more heroic than any other Superman adaptation on the big screen. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "It may not have lived up to the hype, but Man of Steel is still the best modern Superman movie, and well worth checking out even if the screenplay delivers its fair share of disappointments. Still, this feels like a solid opening chapter from Zack Snyder.",
            "In this quick fast episode, I go into a bit more on why I dislike the Man of Steel film",
            "A pandering, monotonous mess that features an anachronistic character who may be best left a relic of the past.",
            "Man of Steel is admittedly missing humor and fun, consumed by the seriousness of producer Christopher Nolan's dark overtones and grey color palate. But the tone was a course correction, and the payoff is great.",
            "It's curious how the abstraction of CGI carnage and the abstraction of plot verbiage seem to go hand in hand. But one thing missing from this resolutely earnest film is humour, which is odd when you consider it's based on a comic book. ",
            "Arguably the most satisfying, complex, and entertaining feature film ever created featuring the superhero.",
            "Henry Cavill breathes new life into the Man of Steel, the most realistic version of Superman we are going to ever get. ",
            "An event movie that is actually an event.",
            "The scenes between Russell Crowe's Jor-El and Michael Shannon's glassy-eyed Zod crackle with tension and drama that the scenes with Henry Cavill's Superman just can't match.",
            "Snyder needs to learn the art of subtlety.",
            "Man of Steel ultimately fails because it forgets its origins. It's a film full of angst and devoid of humor.",
            "Man of Steel isn't going to win over those who are indifferent about Superman, but it does set the stage for future films with more interest in character than in spectacle.",
            "Shannon is no great shakes as the shouty villain and Adams does little with a thankless role. As for Cavill, he certainly looks the part but lacks crucial charm and charisma, surely the two essential qualities any Man of Steel needs,",
            "Man of Steel is grandeur and epic, but it's also deep and personal.",
            "This is an origin story that is rooted outside the actions of one-Clark Kent is not really even the central figure molding it.",
            "The key to great Superman stories is to have ones that give Superman a deep and complex problem that speaks to society at large. Man of Steel successfully reinvented him for the 21st century."

            "Minor flaws aside, August: Osage County is uncomfortable and irritating and brash and bold.",
            "August: Osage County captivates for every second of its two hours of spectacularly awful behaviour. Worth it for the battle of wills between Roberts and Streep alone, when the two finally come to blows, quite literally, it's sheer cinematic gold",
            "Streep competently dominates August: Osage County. It is her vehicle. As an aging cat on a hot tin roof, she gives a tour-de-force performance. ",

            "Directed by John Wells and written by Tracy Letts based on his play of the same name, August: Osage County is a tour de force in acting on all counts. ",
            "Several cast members are in fine form, but most of them have the potential to distract rather than homogenize, and thus, Wells seems to have let everyone do what they do best and the result feels like a competition of skill.",

            "Pleasant, it is not.",
            "There's something cathartic about Letts exorcising his own demons through his writing. And when brought to life by such world-class actors, the results are often electrifying. ",
            "Slow but bolstered by the scene-chewing relish of Streep and Roberts, August: Osage County tries but fails to be the next great take on American kitchen-sink drama.",
            "There are so many tonal shifts, big laughs, awkward laughs, long silences, explosions of anger, and cuttingly clever jabs that your head will spin (mine almost spun right off my neck). ",

            "Still, The Best Man Holiday contains some strong moments and good acting; the cast is as likable as ever, even if the film doesn't take many bold risks.",
            "This is a film about friendships, faith and family and, laden with bittersweet moments, triggers those tear ducts.",
            "It's an odd mix of bawdy comedy and blatant heart-tugging -- you'll be cringeing one moment and sniffing the next.",
            "If the original The Best Man was a smooth, R&B jam then The Best Man Holiday is a slick hip-hop beat. It's bigger and flashier. I missed the scrappiness of the original... ",
            "The first half is such an agreeably raucous reunion that we hate to see a pesky thing like terminal illness ruin all the fun.",
            "While the script may be uneven and the film itself overlong, the cast make for winning company, turning a deft hand to material that zigzags between bawdy and mawkish, somehow keeping it on just the right side of sympathetic.",
            "The Best Man Holiday pigs out on every plot at a slow, bloated Christmas pace. Watch out, movie punters. We're segueing into Part Three. ",
            "The dialogue is sometimes wickedly sharp, the performances good, and all we have to do is swallow great dollops of schmaltz ...",
            "A little cheesy but it's sincere, well performed and good fun.",
            "This rom-com-dram take on The Big Chill isn't quite up there with Lee's sparkling debut but it never succumbs to the grim sudsiness waded through in Tyler Perry territory."
