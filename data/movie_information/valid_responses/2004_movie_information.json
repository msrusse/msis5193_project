            "The animation by which it stands or falls is as brilliant as ever and, though it wouldn't really be right to call it totally anti-Disney, it certainly trumps that institution for sharpness of focus, notably as far as the screenplay is concerned.",
            "All hail the angriest rebel since James Dean. All right, he's green, pot-bellied, and has the social graces of a slug. But in terms of attitude? Peerless. ",
            "Go and see Shrek 2. You'll enjoy yourself thoroughly. Only the churlish could find any faults.",
            "Donkey, with his endless asides and phenomenally thick skin, is as much of a pleasure as he was in the first film, but he has a challenger: Puss in Boots, voiced by Antonio Banderas.",
            "The movie is obvious, but consistently entertaining and animated in DreamWorks's \"realistic\" digitized style.",
            "Can an ogre live happily ever after? Can fairy tale characters be content with their fairy tale lives? Can an Oscar-winning animated success generate a successful sequel? To all these questions, Shrek 2 is happy to answer yes, yes and yes.",
            "Introduces one of the most lovable and laughable characters in animation history: Puss in Boots.",
            "Shrek 2 actually tells a creative story and doesn't just make fun of the fairytale genre but subverts it in some clever ways.",
            "It's just as good - if not better - than the original.",
            "Don't get me wrong. I'm not sulking. I liked Shrek 2. Honest. Kids will like Shrek 2. Most mums and dads will like Shrek 2. My problem is this: I didn't love it the way I loved Shrek.",
            "There's no denying that Shrek 2 is fun, but it's fun without substance, and like the bubbles in the Fairy Godmother's potions, it evaporates quickly.",
            "It's a close call as to which one's better.",
            "It's not often that a sequel is richer and deeper than the original creation, especially when we're talking about the offerings of Hollywood. But Shrek 2 is the exception.",
            "The characters are still charming, the animation really is spectacularly smooth and expressive, and the Looney Tunes-style humor and pop-culture in-jokes are as inventive and hilarious as before.",
            "Shrek 2 is as much of a shriek as the original and if they keep putting out films as charming as this one, we'll all live happily ever after.",
            "Like the original, Shrek 2 remains exceptional value for money for all age groups and essential winter viewing.",
            "There's no narrative, just half-hearted episodes punctuated by occasionally brilliant shtick.",
            "Shrek 2 retains all the fun, artistry and pop stylings of Shrek.",
            "Shrek 2 does not feel like a sequel. It's very funny, very fresh, and leaves one anxious for the next installment.",
            "If fall movies were this consistently clever, there would never be reason to hesitate before plunking down hard-earned bucks at the multiplex.",
            "There's plenty of subtle satire and double entendres for young and old alike to savour.",
            "A minor improvement on the original, and so a major triumph. Donkey bags the heartiest laughs, but Puss-In-Boots adds plenty of cream on top.",
            "Shrek was no ordinary animated film, and Shrek 2 is, rarer still, proving every bit as cute, clever and funny as the original.",
            "This second edition of DreamWorks's Oscar-winning ogre opus may not match the original for, well, originality, but it honors the prime injunction governing sequels: To thine own characters be true."

            "In the end, I, Robot is just an assembly-line product of a not very advanced model. ",
            "He excels in creating alternative worlds and the one here sustains the film, with a pristine beauty that's attractive and slightly sinister.",
            "This sci-fi action adventure, loosely based on the writing of Isaac Asimov, is impressive for Patrick Tatopoulos's production design but depressive for the juiceless story.",
            "[I, Robot] somehow manages to overlook the subversive potential, and it's low on wit, coming up with a good-looking but ultimately inert movie with a feeble non-ending that gave me a pain in all the diodes down my left side.",
            "The way in which the robots acrobatically leap about, as if immune to the effects of gravity, is the main offender.",
            "Some stirring action sequences and a fascinating futuristic setting keeps things entertaining, even if this loose adaptation of the Isaac Asimov doesn't always take the most original approach possible.",
            "...is it a good thing that the CGI robot was so much more interesting and believable than the (largely) human protagonist played by Will Smith? I think not. It somehow made the many shortcomings of the film seem even more apparent.",
            "The plot seemed forced to me, though average summer fare. What bothered me the most however, was the ending. ",
            "I have seen the future and it s an episode of Frasier gone very wrong. The worst episode, actually. Not that I, Robot is a bad film; quite the contrary, it s a shamelessly entertaining video game of a narrative, directed with style and energy.",
            "...it does operate with a crisp, impressive, nuts-and-bolts efficiency as its robots do their best song-and-dance to provide us with a smooth summer diversion.",
            "This may not delve as deeply as AI: Artificial Intelligence or Blade Runner, but director Alex Proyas keeps the action racing along with enough invention and thrills to make this well worth the ride.",
            "The problem with Robot is that it keeps reminding you of better, edgier flicks, notably Blade Runner, The Terminator and Minority Report, not to mention director Alex Proyas's own Dark City.",
            "It's not as dazzling or thrilling a blend between realism and fantasy as Minority Report or even Hollow Man, but it certainly is an easy film to watch and to at times get lost in.",
            "Given how hard it is to find new ideas in mainstream screen sci-fi these days, the film does a creditable job of repackaging standard speculative circuitry under a sleek new blockbuster carapace.",
            "I, Robot is far less concerned with bellowing an Orwellian socio-political warning than with giving Will Smith enough robots to bash apart and send flying across elaborate sets.",
            "It's much more of an action flick than either Metropolis or Blade Runner, but there's a provocative and visionary side to this free adaptation of Isaac Asimov's SF classic that puts it in the same thoughtful canon.",
            "While the shiny props and impressive effects lend high-tech glamour, it is the fine balance of action, character, and an old-school detective story that enable Alex Proyas' impressive sci-fi movie to cross the boundaries of genre.",
            "The result is a cluttered, awkward blockbuster that's just smart enough to get itself into trouble.",
            "It's spectacular entertainment, though under the direction of Alex Proyas it also has a darkly apocalyptic visual scheme.",
            "The plot unravels rather than cranking up. The McGuffin with Spooner can be seen coming from a long way off, while the film jinks rather than twists towards its inevitable climax.",
            "A dreary action-mystery that spends far too much time mucking around a villainous plot that isn't nearly as difficult to unravel as the protagonist makes it.",
            ". . .the movie starts to really lose its way, and tries to distract us, the audience, with lots 'o big stupid action moments and slow-mo shots of Will Smith flying through the air, yelling \"YARGHHHHH!!\" spraying bullets as he goes."

            "It's this relentlessness of the action and technology that make the film more of a simulated ride. I wouldn't have boarded.",
            "What's left is a world of industrial Gothicism, nightmare morphing effects, ahistoric gadgetry and Breughel-lite grotesquerie.",
            "The exteriors are fantastic, the castles mega-looming, and there's a beautiful -- if fanciful -- masqued ball which shows off to perfection the costumes contrived by Gabriella Pescucci.",
            "This is one vampire movie with bite.",
            "The horror flick, at its height, was a lyrical caressing of our fears; by the end of this nonsense, you fear for the well-being of the genre. 'It's dead!'",
            "It's empty calories: There isn't a single nourishing, non-synthetic sequence in the entire movie. Not a scene. Not a line. Not a look.",
            "The humor, most of which comes from a monk as a comic sidekick, doesnt work here either. It just emphasizes how campy the whole premise really is.",
            "Hugh Jackman stars as the sexiest Van Helsing to ever hit the screen. Even more impressive... is his larger than life screen presence and physicality that keeps his character from becoming overshadowed by the incredible amount of CGI and monster effects",
            "If you're prepared to overlook the canon-messing, plus the odd bit of crap dialogue or dodgy CGI, then Van Helsing is surprisingly enjoyable, with several impressive action set pieces.",
            "Van Helsing is the epitome of an escapist movie - the kind that used to be shown on Saturday afternoon. But now, thanks to massive budgets and big-name stars, Saturday comes seven days a week.",
            "Despite (or maybe because of) the nonstop action and the special effects, I looked at my watch a lot. This is too long and the script is nothing but segues from one action, special effect-laden, sequence to another. ",
            "By the final scene, all we care about is when Sommers will wrap up his magic act and let us all go home.",
            "The results here are eye-dazzling, indeed, but undermined by the screenplay, a comic-book containing every cliche as well as every monster in the genre except Bigfoot and the Abominable Dr. Phibes.",
            "Thirteen year old boys will love it. Its bound to make lots of money on its opening weekend, and is open-ended enough for a sequel.",
            "There are a number of good ideas just visible, but they seem to have been edited to death. Where the film needed vision, there is only polite compromise. ",
            "Hugh Jackman may be able to hold his own but not by much. It's not his fault though.",
            "I think Van Helsing is worth seeing on the big screen, if nothing else than for the audience reaction and to see the action and effects in the theater.",
            "Sommers has talent, but no discipline or attention span. ",
            "Van Helsing itself is an unholy mix of exhumed ideas from a generation of monster movies. Unlike the monster, though, it never comes to life.",
            "We do not care about anything or anyone, we just thrill to the next special effect.",
            "If Van Helsing was meant to be a Saturday afternoon matinee fodder, it is both too ponderous to be fun and too silly to be scary.",
            "For me, Stephen Sommers falls in the same category as Renny Harlin. He's one of the best hacks in the business.",
            "A chaotic blur of recycled archetypes from classic horror flicks, action sequences unbound by laws of gravity and physics, and CGI special effects that somehow manage to appear ridiculously expensive and unconvincingly obvious all at once.",
            "The already-lousy House of Frankenstein as done up by a filmmaker whose idea of style is to make things as loud and busy as possible... A screaming, noisy, overedited mess of a movie."

            "A quite extraordinarily boring psychological drama of obsession, impersonation and mistaken identity.",

            "Wicker Park is built on such a goofy premise that your average soap-opera scriptwriter would laugh it out of a story meeting.",
            "There are some striking visuals and Hartnett is a magnetic presence.",
            "Both bland and slightly daft.",
            "Tortuously twisting in on itself, Wicker Park keeps you guessing as it keeps its central pair apart. But it's scuppered by a plodding obviousness that's underlined by a sledgehammer soundtrack.",
            "Convoluted though this plot may seem, at least the inventive visuals from Gangster No 1 director Paul McGuigan keep you engrossed.",
            "These four characters bounce off each other, slowly revealing motivations and desires and deceptions, providing a mildly entertaining, but ultimately shallow, experience.",
            "A convoluted structure makes this story hard work, but like the French original, it engages with its dazzling zig zag of time frames and varied perspective.",
            "Director Paul McGuigan keeps the story racing along, but it smacks of contrived manipulation rather than credibility.",
            "This dopey thriller isn't worth your time.",
            "The filmmakers cannot decide what sort of story they want to tell, and as a result, the story they tell isn't really worth the telling.",
            "McGuigan imbues Wicker Park with a disorienting atmosphere and visual style, using available window panes and deep focus techniques like a split-screen effect to show simultaneous actions and emotions upon which the narrative twists and turns.",
            "Sadly, we never really get the sense that these individuals are at the mercy of their capricious desires, and the absence of that engagement leaves us rather too much time to ponder the plot holes.",
            "Wicker Park frustrates to no end when a smidgen of common sense on anyone's behalf would clear up everything.",
            "A nice example of what happens to a Hitchcock shrine when it's filtered through a slick punk sensibility.",
            "That Wicker Park becomes as engrossing as it does is particularly shocking, given the almost interminable opening hour...",
            "Feel free to take a leisurely stroll out to the lobby for Swedish fish in the middle of Wicker Park. Missing 10 minutes won't affect your ability to follow this babel in the least.",

            "Take a pretty good script, a pretty good Director, and a horrible cast, and what you get is Wicker Park.",

            "It's like a '30s screwball comedy that's gone to grad school...hits the ground running, flinging verbal and visual information at you with machine-gun velocity. Your mind is engaged and delighted.",
            "While superficially I Heart Huckabees is a deranging experience, it ends up being deeply reassuring.",
            "I &#9829; Huckabees is a rarity-a tremendously optimistic film for a truly dark time.",
            "Brilliant existential comedy for adults only.",
            "This feverish state-of-the-split-nation address finds Russell tossing everything that matters -- and more -- into the pot, and producing a pretty indigestible and very messy stew.",
            "If you're up for it, you'll discover a fresh, funny little romp unafraid to tackle the biggest issues of all.",
            "Russell directs with the ambition of Altman and the nervous energy of Paul Thomas Anderson, and his script sounds like it was co-written by Howard Hawks and Charlie Kaufman.",
            "You don't get many clear answers from this film and maybe that's for the better.",
            "Russell directs an excellent cast in a thought provoking existential comedy that is very funny and very well acted.",
            "I have no idea what the film is really all about, but this top line cast makes it so much fun, it doesn't seem to matter.",
            "Metaphysics, madness and Mancala meet in this fun, fresh and overtly philosophical tale about, well, all kinds of things, really.",
            "Despite an outstanding cast of actors and some funny moments, I never cared enough to believe that this movie was anything other than pretentious; the kind of movie they might show in Philosophy 101 classes.",
            "Tomlin hasn't had a comic role this rich in years, and she sinks her teeth into it with something like ecstasy.",
            "Maddeningly uneven but mildly amusing.",
            "Si vous \u00eates pr\u00eat \u00e0 suivre \u00e0 votre maximum d'attention une com\u00e9die qui ne semble pas faire beaucoup de sens, vous risquez [...] de vous y retrouver.",
            "I &#9829; Huckabees might be too smart for its own good, but that also seems to be the point. Russell extols liberal activism while deflating its self-importance...",
            "A high-concept, high-minded piece of pseudointellectual trash, \"I Heart Huckabees\" is one of those stink bombs the intelligentsia like to champion.",
            "...while it is little more than a lightweight charade masquerading as deep wisdom, there were parts of it I enjoyed.",
            "At its heart, this is basically the story of one man's attempt to prove that his life has meaning. What could be more relatable than that?",
            "I hate Huckabees!",
            " I ? Huckabees really only succeeds on the level of slapstick, with Tomlin's impeccable timing being the chief delight."

            "The pleasure of the film, as in many French films from Renoir to Rohmer, is in the exactitude of observation, the accuracy of the portrait and the elegance of the writing.",
            "Although little about the story seems surprising or spontaneous, the film's delights lie in its acute observation of the characters and their interactions.",
            "Both an implicit protest against the blindness of power and an equally fervent protest against the acquiescence of men and women who are too weak or too compromised to stand up for themselves -- that is, most people.",
            "At best, a most watchable character study of lives that are more interesting than compelling.",
            "[Has] a light, sometimes hilarious touch.",
            "Jaoui sets her wryly observant sights on family, artistic ambition and the tyranny of physical appearance, and the result is a bright, briskly moving film whose modest scale belies the universality of its themes.",
            "\"Look at Me\" is a wholesome work of fully rounded dramaturgy that spins on a gyroscope of sustained emotional momentum.",
            "Examines a variety of questions, such as superficiality versus substance, materialism versus self-worth, and taking advantage of others versus forming sincere relationships.",
            "Sadly, too much focus is spent on showing character traits that any kind of coherent story or compassion for characters is destroyed.",
            "Forces the audience to ride the waves of some complicated relationships without having a built-in hero or heroine for which to root.",
            "a sharp illustration of how it feels to resent someone you know you're supposed to love.",
            "Agn\u00e8s Jaoui's second film is the type of light, Foucauldian romantic comedy that only the French can make.",
            "(...) Una comedia humana que incluso depara, seg\u00fan la sensibilidad de cada uno, varias notas de emoci\u00f3n.",
            "The work of a wry, generous filmmaker who wants to sympathize with even her most self-centered characters...",
            "A biting and insightful tale of life in Parisian literary circles, and how celebrity and ambition can send ripples through relationships.",
            "Bacri and Jaoui happens to have a soft spot for their countrymen, which results in a warm, funny movie for us to like, too.",
            "Perhaps because she is also an actress, Jaoui understands motivation and interaction, and, with co-star Jean-Pierre Bacri, who plays the father, creates characters of substance and dimension out of scraps of human weakness.",
            "Jaoui is something of a romantic, yes, but she's also a bit of a cynic - or at least an amused realist. ",
            "Flawlessly acted and meticulously observed.",
            "...does more than flatter its audience's sense of taste.",
            "But add up these formidable parts and all you get is still a distant story of wealthy and miserable French literati stewing in their own self-contempt.",
            "Look at Me confirms what The Taste of Others suggested - that Jaoui has a sharp talent for cutting through the self-absorbed baloney of the French bourgeoisie."

            "The subject could be, and has been, exploitative in other films, but Joshua Marston shrewdly sketches asides of drama about whether Maria should simply remain in New York. To his credit, that outcome feels as fraught with peril as her drug-running.",

            "Howl's Moving Castle is Japanese and anime, and therefore automatically more artistic than its US counterparts. The right cultural cachet gives you a lot of leeway.",
            "A floatingly delightful fairytale with its heart set on repealing the law of gravity.",
            "Miyazaki's vision is an extraordinary one, and Howl's Moving Castle confirms his fascination for transformations, for dangerous journeys and strange adventures.",
            "Miyazaki isn't interested in the jolts of surrealism so much as imbuing his audience with the idea that reality can change at any moment, and change back just as quickly.",
            "Whereas Spirited [Away] saw the world through the eyes of a child, Howl sees it through the eyes of an adult who longs to be young again.",
            "Despite Miyazaki's undoubted gifts for story, character and cute animation, the diverse cultural agendas jar badly. ",
            "I do find it a bit slow... [but] I'm glad I saw it.",
            "The rich landscapes and colours just jump off the screen at you in the best possible ways. Each character has such unique features and expressions that make them truly stand out.",
            "One of Hayao Miyazaki's strengths is the sense of wonderment and magic that he's able to bring to his films.",
            "The story is almost the least of it, more important is what is beyond the story: genuine emotion, beauty, a meditation on age and love.",
            "There is little of the magic and Japanese flavour of such Miyazaki masterpieces as Spirited Away.",
            "Like Tiepolo, Miyazaki is a winged artist who flies in his own space, taking gravity with him. He can put us into a childish stupor of anticipation, then satisfaction. His vision is so free that it captivates.",
            "It is so intriguing.",
            "The film, as expected, is a feast for the eyes.",
            "Howl's Moving Castle is a graceful fantasy that builds on the strengths Hayao Miyazaki displayed in Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away.",
            "Even if the plot leaves something to be desired in terms of explanation, it can be followed if you stay on your toes. Either way, Howl's Moving Castle is a marvel to watch.",
            "I've only recently started scratching the surface of Japanese anim\u00e9 as an art form, an acquired taste still, but it is works of full wonder and beauty like this one that keep pushing me into acquiring it.",
            "A very good fantasy epic about life, war, and a young learning to live through old age.",
            "Despite the muddy narrative... It's the more intimate character relationships that ultimately make Howl's Moving Castle work as a whole.",
            "What you get, above all, is some enchanting flashes of classic Miyazaki and the nagging sense that something essential is missing.",

            "Yamada's enormously enjoyable The Hidden Blade is a movie that deftly balances the obligations of samurai history with love story.",
            "Reminders of feudal Japan are mixed in with a prescient glimpse into the country's future. The samurai will not be part of it, and The Hidden Blade poignantly shows what is lost in the name of progress.",
            "An affecting portrait of the impact of profound change on people with limited options.",
            "The Hidden Blade bears more than a passing resemblance in story and form to The Twilight Samurai, but stands on its own as a pleasant, if unremarkable, romance.",
            "Both epic and intimate, this impassioned samurai drama is for anyone who's ever watched a movie and muttered, 'They just don't make 'em like they used to.'",
            "Second installment in Yamada's samurai trilogy. Once again the hero is unlike the super-warriors of the genre, but far more interesting.",
            "A character-driven, martial arts adventure more concerned with motivations than karate moves.",
            "Hidden Blade works, then, as that rare, intellectually stirring historical pageant, but also as a deeply emotional, satisfying samurai movie, one of the crown jewels of the genre.",
            "a totally immersive experience",
            "It's a pretty simple tale, but -- true to his Western influences -- Yamada slows down the action and stretches it out to a prize-winning length.",
            "... the restrained drama both punctures the mythic ideal of the samurai culture and spins a romantic portrait of one man who values principle over protocol...",
            "This is a film buff's movie but also has strong appeal to those who just want to be told a darn good story.",
            "Yamada's film is old-fashioned in the very best sense. He is a great story teller and director of actors.",
            "Good, but a bit of a snorer.",
            "Casually paced and filled with telling detail, Yamada's delicate drama with swordplay (there's not much, but what there is packs an emotional wallop) transcends its specific setting in its depiction of Katagiri's internal struggle.",
            "Yoji Yamada redefines the words 'cinematic perfection' with a film that looks and feels like a true classic.",
            "[R]eminded me of one of [John] Ford's more elegiac Westerns",
            "While Yamada essentially repeats himself structurally, he finds fresh ironies in the story of how a culture built on tradition gets corrupted by technology and years of inaction.",
            "The Hidden Blade is tranquil, touching, and, in its climactic sword fight, excitingly real.",
            "From the beginning Yamada's movie, made in 2004, looks and feels more like a John Ford western than any other Asian film I've ever seen.",
            "Yamada's film is strong and poignant, though perhaps it will be more so with Japanese audiences who better understand societal pressure."

            "I don't think it's his masterpiece, but it's a big, beautiful, sad film with unforgettable performances.",
            "Anyone who doesn't believe that Clint Eastwood is one of the best film-makers in America ought to see Million Dollar Baby.",
            "The movie is simultaneously conventional and subversive, broad and nuanced, shamelessly manipulative and genuinely moving, a cheap sucker punch and a work of real moral weight.",
            "The film is impeccably made, but more than that, the director who also composed the lovely music score, brings a rare degree of humanity to the intensely moving conclusion.",
            "As the film draws to its powerhouse close, gentle piano music by Eastwood himself gives this haunting tragedy an even higher level of poignancy.",
            "Fakes you out, then knocks you flat with a right hook to the heart.",
            "Million Dollar Baby is aesthetically and emotionally a dark movie that ultimately falls short because every rough edge is softened by a clich\u00e9. Here, Eastwood throws a handful of sugar in for good measure, too. ",
            "Turning the conventions of the boxing movie inside out, this sees Eastwood - as actor and director - at the top of his game.",
            "A one-man shop who even composed the muted score for his movie, Eastwood reminds us how films are best created, like Maggie's destiny in the ring, with one's own hands.",

            "...[Clint] Eastwood teaches us his journey to achieve [respect] with modesty. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "In Million Dollar Baby, Eastwood makes us believe both that [the] relationship is completely surprising and wholly a product of fate. ",
            "[It's] about so much more than boxing. It's about redemption, risk-taking, the search for family and God, the pursuit of a dream, a soul-shattering moral dilemma and the father-daughter relationship that develops between Frankie and Maggie.",
            "As sappy and Lifetime-y as all this sounds, Eastwood's skill with the performers keeps Million Dollar Baby afloat. ",
            "What moves you so powerfully at the end is not just a shattering tale of two old guys and a female boxer but, in our new millennium, a 74-year-old man's ability to tell it so powerfully without (apparently) the melancholy business of movies laying a glove",
            "Its very conventionality is what makes it so compelling; we've seen this before, but it still gets us every time.",
            "Always one of America's most undervalued directors, Clint Eastwood is proving himself the American cinema's national treasure in the third act of his career.",

            "Like a very fine wine, Clint Eastwood is getting better with age. Now 75, the actor-director has delivered one of the year's best US films.",
            "I'd be amazed if Swank failed to punch her way to a serious prize after this feat; she is an extraordinary bundle of ferocity and ice.",
            "Million Dollar Baby, above all else, feels like a work that comes out of years of living, and years of experience with people, and knowing what works and what doesn't. It also comes from a director who is still able to be touched when two people connect."

            "Scorsese gives us a lot more than the Charles Foster Kane of the clouds. He keeps focus on Hughes, the dreamer, who continually reached out, grabbed the future and pulled it toward him.",
            "At the epicentre of this movie maelstrom is an assured and adroit performance by Leonardo DiCaprio.",

            "The Aviator is a flawed but incredibly passionate and entertaining film befitting a character as flamboyant as Hughes.",
            "Leonardo DiCaprio meticulously depicts the maverick entrepreneur in all his guises -- from the off, he cleverly conveys (through body language) the ailments that would beset Hughes -- noticeably OCD and deafness. It's a stunning performance.",
            "Is really little more than three hours of the director polishing his mantel in anticipation of an Oscar.",
            "The dramatic conceit that a great, obsessive personality begets an obsessive, dysfunctional personal life and frail mental well-being just isn't that nuanced or tragic.",
            "Solidly entertaining and visually lush, but this is uncharacteristically safe territory for a filmmaker who relishes risk and grittiness.",
            "This is high-style filmmaking wrapped up in a tormented hero whose soaring flights of greatness are matched by the mortal pull of his devils,...",
            "It's all rather sprawling and a bit disjointed, but Scorsese's vigorous pacing and eye for detail hold it all together and provide a vivid setting for DiCaprio's masterful performance (his best work yet).",
            "Scorsese's most engaged and engaging filmmaking in a while.",
            "Its plot moves from event to event without a story driving it and the audience is left drifting along.",

            "It's all pretty swanky.",
            "Like an adrenaline rush, Riding Giants is fun for a while but it ends on a comedown.",
            "Instead of weighing the film down with spaced-out surfer-dude quotes, director Stacy Peralta traces the sport's origins back to the ancient Hawaiians.",
            "Before seeing Riding Giants, my ideas about surfing were formed by the Gidget movies, Endless Summer, the Beach Boys, Elvis and lots of TV commercials. ... Riding Giants is about altogether another reality.",
            "It's a treacherous, vivid and compelling ride, and Peralta is in his element assembling and seamlessly integrating old footage with new. ",
            "Lively look at big wave surfing.",
            "Just short of dropping you into the ocean with a surfboard, Riding Giants serves as the definitive (and immersive) guide to the essence of all that is surfing.\"",
            "This even more exhilarating documentary focuses more on the history of the sport.",
            "At its heart, Riding Giants is a work of pure joy.",
            "Peralta has a great sense of pacing and a good eye for B-roll footage.",
            "Through gently panned-over photos (one of many debts to Burns) and home-movie footage, Peralta traces the graceful arc of the sport, its culture, and its icons.",
            "...an enjoyable, well-paced look at the discovery and evolution of big wave riding",
            "Wonderfully entertaining while being genuinely educational.",
            "Even for people who know little about surfing, the film should prove a fascinating crib sheet.",
            "Entertaining, informative and insightful, this is a hugely enjoyable film that stands a good chance of picking up the Best Documentary award come Oscar time.",
            "Surf's up!",
            "If you can't swing a Hawaiian vacation, this may be the next best thing.",
            "Gets a lot of mileage out of a familiar topic, in large part thanks to Peralta, an insider whose enthusiasm for the sport is contagious.",
            "Peralta is smart to focus on the personalities in surfing, rather than just giving us a Warren Miller-style compendium of awesome surfing footage.",
            "Replete with color home films of surfing in California and Hawaii in the 1940s and 1950s in addition to the footage shot for the film...this is a don't miss film. "

            "One of those special films that broadens and deepens as it goes on.",

            "Machuca is sweet, poignant, and winningly evocative of the period, though occasionally dogged by predictable scenarios and caricatures.",

            "The suspense of watching the storylines weave together (and occasionally butt heads) like a Czech-language \"Short Cuts\" makes for a compelling and darkly funny film.",
            "While parts of 'Up and Down' are effective, as a whole it doesn't measure up to its laudable ambition...the last word of the title proves more accurate than the first.",
            "A dryly scathing examination of life after communism.",
            "The story's lack of impact onscreen reflects its lack of impact on those of us offscreen.",
            "Its many ideas never quite cohere, and it remains an admirable misfire...",
            "Hrebejk's post-Soviet Czech Republic is more than a little like the American South, a conquered territory rife with old wounds and fresh indignities.",
            "Hrebejk deftly brings the stories together, and does so without delving into sentimentality.",
            "An excellent piece of work: Just don't expect a rollicking farce",
            "H\u00f8ebejk claims inspiration from the likes of Mike Leigh and Woody Allen, and that can be seen in the surety of the characters, brought to life by an able cast that includes former Czech president V\u00e1clav Havel.",

            "This exercise in bad taste is the Dawn of the Dead of nymphomania. Never mean-spirited, A Dirty Shame has some big laughs, but it's a one-joke movie that shows its strain well before the finish line. ",
            "A genuine cri de couer in the director's long-running battle against the forces of censorship and a banal societal (and cinematic) status quo.",
            "The story is trite and uninteresting. And the humor is only occasionally funny, and that's largely because it's almost impossible not to be impressed by Tracey Ullman's manic energy.",
            "A welcome reminder that sex is sometimes too ridiculous to take so seriously.",
            "Makes sex seem the least exciting thing in the world. And that's a dirty shame, indeed.",
            "... you can have an open mind and hate this movie because I good well hated this movie.",
            "Waters has made a resolutely unsexy sex comedy, but he hasn't left out the comedy.",
            " On the one hand it depicts what the world might be like if women had the same constancy of sexual desire that men have, but on the other hand, it has the intelligence level of a teenage boy's dirty joke.",
            "No shame here.",
            "Exploring the wide divide between prudes and the world of sexual excess, there's enough bad taste on display to shock, amuse and entertain. Sizzles when hot, fizzles when not",
            "A Dirty Shame is a fabulously funny exploration of fetishism, a look at the ever-more-insane ways people find to 'get off'.",
            "Wow. The challenges of reviewing an NC-17 movie for a family newspaper are, um, challenging.",
            "More a return to roots than a return to form, this messy carnal-concussion comedy celebrates the libido and every form of sexual practice",
            "A Dirty Shame is not a good movie, but it has a good message, and for that, it's well worth seeing.",
            "Outrageous, filthy and often hysterically funny, this is John Waters' best film since Serial Mom.",
            "John Waters takes on the decency brigade with a social comedy that's a refreshing return to his unhinged filmmaking style.",
            "The NC-17 rating and the images of Selma Blair with her gargantuan bosom seemed to promise a return to form - if Waters were going dirty again, how could he disappoint?",
            "A Dirty Shame is outrageous for the sake of being outrageous, but unlike some of Waters' other films, it's neither shocking nor funny.",
            "The filmic equivalent of a child reading aloud the Dictionary of Filth with the express intent of giving his nanny a heart attack.",
            "Goes through the surface motions of naughtiness, [but] it all comes off rather quaint in the end."

            "The movie is slight but observant and not nearly as maestro-batory as some of Bertolucci's other work.",

            "The film's a treat to watch, with luxuriant camerawork by Fabio Cianchetti and a gorgeous, intimate score by Franco Piersanti.",
            "Though the setting is a retreat from the world, where not terribly much happens, within its confines Lorenzo gets an eye-opener about both human frailty and interconnectedness, courtesy of someone even more troubled than he is.",
            "The film never elevates beyond a sometimes ungainly and trifling exploration of themes and relationships exhibited more daringly and memorably in other works.",
            "It remains remarkable that, at the grand old age of 73, Bertolucci is still making films of intelligence and guile, let alone features about teenage angst and sexual maturation. ",
            "To Bertolucci's credit, he keeps his young characters' relationship platonic while still acknowledging Lorenzo's burgeoning sexuality.",
            "A minor effort at best, and disappointingly lacking a sense of energy or intent, \"Me And You\" is Bertolucci exercising his filmmaking muscles, but not flexing them. ",
            "Despite Bertolucci's keen eye, Antinori's wolfish face, Falco's impressive work (watch her mischievous smile turn into a lean, hungry, vengeful stare in a bravura scene), and a few striking moments, a strong sense of going-through-the-motions persists.",
            "Me and You sits on a very sharp edge for the duration as we watch this pasty and pimply-faced kid descend into self-pity.",
            "A coming-of-age drama about a boy whose dream of being alone is shattered when his older half-sister brings him back to messy reality.",
            "Bertolucci is indeed a master, and \"Me and You\" evidences numerous thematic connections to his earlier work as well as constant proof of his distinctive gifts as a stylist.",
            "Mostly what's missing in Me and You, what drains it of insight and resonance, is a sense of the world outside of Lorenzo's apartment building.",
            "Lorenzo, the bratty 14-year-old protagonist of Bernardo Bertolucci's \"Me and You,\" is the quintessence of flailing adolescent angst.",
            "An underwhelming coming-of-age fable that skirts around its own lurid undertones.",
            "Bernardo Bertolucci's most negligible effort to date, in which he takes a familiar - for him - premise and does very little with it.",
            "Me and You has the reflection and patience of age, and the fleet-footed energy of youth.",
            "Bertolucci depicts Olivia's ordeal explicitly and the siblings' bonding tenderly. He makes eloquent use of the claustrophobic set.",
            "Me And You is modest and unhurried, at a pace with its ailing director. ",
            "Not even Bernardo Bertolucci's choice of a lead actor with visible facial acne scars, in a welcome gesture toward authenticity, is enough to overcome the gaping hole of psychological nuance at the center of the film.",
            "It's a tender film with great affection for these two souls; but it's also slight and formulaic, with persistent off-key notes, like the youngsters' 1970s-'80s taste in music.",
            "An intimate, miniature and subterranean coming-of-age drama ..."

            "Dear Mr. Winterbottom. Intercutting unsimulated sex scenes with concert footage does not a movie make. Love, David B.",
            "One cannot entirely condemn Winterbottom, because the film is not without its meritorious moments, yet at the same time, 9 Songs doesn't effectively traverse the line of glorified pornography, so much as it narrowly scrapes past it.",

            "I like to think -- and please indulge me on this -- that my reaction to the controversial 9 Songs has more to do with the limitations of Michael Winterbottom's latest cinematic experiment than with any of my own nihilistic-horndog tendencies.",

            "Given the graphic sex scenes, it is surprisingly dull. The music isn't great, either, now that we think about it.",
            "Maybe the Nine Songs way -- showing us how they respond to each other in intimate moments and what sort of music moves them -- is a more direct route inside their heads.",

            "Not only does this surprisingly warm and funny -- and well-acted -- comedy-drama stand head and shoulders above the most recent crop of LDS features, it's a film that may appeal to moviegoers outside its obvious target audience.",

            "It isn't about how to convert someone. It's about converting yourself, about figuring out what you're doing with your life and going with it. ... Thoughtful and entertaining."

            "Maybe it has something to do with Sam Raimi's skills as a director, or with Tobey Maguire's very human central performance, but the Spider-Man films are by far the best of the superhero genre. ",
            "A sequel that not only outstrips its predecessor but has a perversity and quick-wittedness that hardly seem to belong in a comic-book movie.",
            "Spider-Man 2 is better than just dark, it's touched by authentic teenage paranoia and neurosis.",
            "This is a better picture than the first because it makes its characters human, doesn't camp it up and refuses to believe that Kerpow! Kerching! is more than a constituent part of the proceedings.",
            "Alfred Molina makes a more baroque supervillain than Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin, but the other stars seem happy to be giving us more of the same. Sam Raimi's direction, on the other hand, is even more fluent and well paced.",
            "The web-slinging sequences are bigger-better-brighter-faster than the already spectacular ones in 2002's Spider-Man, and at the same time, the film's smaller emotional moments are denser, richer and more resonant than those in the first.",
            "A groundbreaking, epic masterpiece, Spider-Man 2 sees Sam Raimi continue to make great use of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's classic stories to deliver the rare perfect sequel. ",
            "It does delude the possibility of a different Marvel, less limited and more permeable to authorship and the unpredictable forces of the fantastic. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Not compelled to spend time sketching in the origin of Spider-Man, Raimi can flesh out his villain of the piece, Dr Octopus, and it's a lovely performance by Alfred Molina. ",
            "Raimi's film delivers a carefully balanced mix of warm-hearted sentiment and exhilarating spectacle. Darkening the tone, but never straying very close to the edge, this is feel-good fantasy. ",
            "Displays the kind of poise and confidence that can only happen when you're following on from a critical smash that also became one of the most successful movies of all time.",
            "Due to back pain, Tobey Maguire was almost replaced by Jake Gyllenhaal, the Topher Grace of Gyllenhalls.",
            "The second installment of the trilogy, co-scripted by Michael Chabon, is a real supe-opera, with the usual young adult turmoil pushed into the realms of comic-book mythology with the complications of his power, guilt, and responsibility. ",
            "Spiderman 2 is has got a little bit of everything: angst, explosions, tight suits, bad guys, good guys, more explosions.",
            "Spider-Man 2 is not a great movie. It is, however, a great superhero movie, one of the best ever made. If only its influence could more clearly be felt in the \"Avengers\" CGI-fests of today.",
            "The trick with Spider-Man is to swing both ways -- the superheroics and the super lack of self-esteem -- without getting mired in the dreary introspective moping that did for Ang Lee's awful Hulk. Spider-Man 2 balances it all but perfectly,",
            "Spider-Man 2 ranks alongside Superman II and both X-Men films as the best screen adaptations of comic book heroes, a status that, as we've seen through the years, isn't as easy to master as it sounds.",
            "An expertly crafted mix of drama, romance, humour and action that outdoes its more conventionally generic predecessor.",
            "Emotionally deeper, better looking and twice as exciting as the blockbuster that kicked off the franchise two years ago, Spider-Man 2 just became the new gold standard for the current crop of super-hero movies.",
            "Through it all, Maguire remains the ideal actor to play the conflicted superhero. Earnest and vulnerable, you see why he delights in the transformation to superhero. And why he also feels its burden.",
            "A comic-book sequel to surpass even X2, this is a resounding success.",
            "With the reluctant hero's origins covered in the first movie, a sequel offered returning director Sam Raimi the chance to have some real fun. And that's exactly what he does.",
            "For summer popcorn fun, this movie has it all: special effects, romance, action and humor.",
            "Director Sam Raimi's follow-up to his first Spider-Man is damn near perfect."

            "Butler's stirring film wasn't made to refute its slanders, though it does. It's a richly documented history of Kerry's war- time experience and of the Veterans Against the War movement. ",
            "This should be revelatory to most people -- but most people will probably never see Mr. Butler's film, and certainly none of those who consider George W. Bush as next to God.",
            "One of the most moving things for me was seeing that some of the high-ranking politicians really did recognize that, hey, we need to meet with these young men and hear what they have to say and that footage is amazing stuff.",
            "Brinkley has done his homework, and the evidence is on the screen.",
            "Butler is on record as a close friend of Kerry's, but he's also a well-respected documentarian, who introduced Arnold Schwarzenegger to America in Pumping Iron and chronicled the heroism of Ernest Shackleton in The Endurance.",
            "Filmgoers in the mood for one more go-round will be fascinated by this documentary by George Butler.",
            "compelling story without fancy gimmicks and trickery",
            "It's too bad that Kerry's likely to lose the upcoming election, because this type of hagiography would be far better in the unlikely event that Mr. \"Wartime\" President is going to be defeated.",

            "Going Upriver is lucky enough to have at its disposal a genuinely charismatic figure whose sense of his own citizenship is rigorous, questioning, and articulate.",
            "It's only OK as a movie, but it's a fantastic political ad.",
            "Butler's film may do little to change the outcome of the election, but anyone who questions Kerry's convictions should see Going Upriver before casting their vote.",
            "There's an innocence, a purity in intention ... that one rarely sees in a documentary.",
            "It's not angry or loud; it hopes that the truth spoken at a moderate level is stronger than lies trumpeted on national television.",
            "\"Going Upriver'' is a worthy film for the portrait it offers of one candidate and, more lastingly, for the portrait of a generation that emerges alongside it.",
            "A serious, often very moving portrait of the effect the Vietnam War had on the nation and particularly those who served in it.",
            "Butler's style is lot like Kerry's: analytic, deliberate, a bit plodding, but always with his eyes on the prize.",
            "We can only wish all candidates for such high office could match or even come close to the standards of qualification set by Kerry.",
            "[I]t will leave you with questions you'll be asking long after the November election. ",
            "A partisan film but ultimately a powerful one.",
            "Most of what's in Going Upriver is prime, yet much more valuable as a VVAW chronicle than a Kerry tribute.",
            "It underscores, with ample footage from his rallying speeches and his 1971 testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, just how important it was for the antiwar movement to be represented by someone like Kerry."

            "A disturbing self-portrait limned from the filmmaker's relentless narcissism and his fetishization of mental illness, family dysfunction and personal suffering."

            "This masterwork by Ousmane Sembene, the 81-year-old father of African cinema and one of Senegal's greatest novelists, is the second film in a trilogy celebrating African women.",
            "Ousmane, who wrote and directs, gives strong flavors to his characterization of village life and its peoples. But as drama the film mostly serves to illustrate the two sides of this crucial social debate in Africa.",
            "This is an impassioned and uplifting film.",
            "Poetic, provocative and unstoppably powerful. But, depressingly, it probably won't change a thing.",
            "Though Moolaad\u00e9 doesn't shy away from the task of educating its viewers about the brutality of 'purification,' it works equally well as a tribute to righteous defiance wherever it surfaces.",
            "It's certainly clear where the director stands on the issue, but underneath is a far richer film about the complex issues of globalization and the values of tradition.",
            "Moolad\u00e9 is a masterful work, which eloquently conveys the central conflict between tradition and modernity in our global economy. ",
            "Thrilling and alive and far more entertaining and exciting and easy to watch than just about any message movie you have ever seen... a cinematic triumph of the highest order.",
            "The eightysomething Sembene delivers a powerfully acted and colourfully shot polemic. A perceptive observation of daily life in an African village that celebrates female bravery and solidarity.",
            "Every character is a symbol for Sembene to realize his humanistic visions in a folklore type of cinema.",
            "Tthe most exuberant films ever made about female circumcision.",
            "\"Moolaade\" works as a stirring parable for any community where progressive citizens and regressive policies collide.",
            "Solemnity rarely taints Semb\u00e9ne's films; his anger and indignation are invariably tempered by his warmth, humour and generosity of spirit.",
            "Sembene provides not only a fascinating glimpse into the culture of tropical Africa, but also a powerful account of the social turmoil which bubbles beneath the surface.",
            "Never less than vivid.",
            "Moolaade is an amazing film -- colourful, in-your-face, thick with intense conversation -- and because of the subject matter, it's simultaneously fascinating and repellent to watch.",
            "A story told in music, vivid imagery and ritualistic movement.",
            "Tackles a seriously important issue without losing the vibrant energy of everyday life.",
            "A film made with anger and passion that is in parts infuriating, inspiring and heartbreaking.",
            "There's a lot to admire in Moolaade, including the way in which the filmmakers lay out the premise and necessary story details within the first 10 or 15 minutes.",
            "A righteously angry movie, [but] also a joyous movie, because Senegalese director Ousmane Sembene ... fills every moment with song and color and life.",

            "Unwieldy and flawed, but Stone remains a tornado in an era of airless formula and -- to paraphrase our Ptolemy -- its failings are greater than most films' successes.",
            "Farrell, a remarkable actor on most occasions, is fatally miscast. His Alexander is a petulant crybaby, and it is hard to imagine anyone - let alone armies and nations galore - bending themselves to his will.",
            "By summoning his inner classicist, [director] Stone has made an excruciating disaster for the ages.",
            "Though the battles have the blood-and-sinew bravado you expect from Oliver Stone, this three-hour buttnumbathon is hamstrung by a hectoring grandiosity, not new to Stone, and a nod toward caution, which is.",
            "Stone has always relished posing more questions than he has answers in biopics. In Alexander, however, he enjoys it a little too much. ",
            "The film that resulted from this obsessive desire for historical accuracy is a dud: a baggy, incoherent, bloviating mess in which any sense of the thrilling and impressive arc of Alexander's career sinks beneath the weight of period detail.",

            "The reason it's exhausting, and ultimately boring, to sit through Alexander-and why the movie is already disappearing from theaters-is that. . .there's no dramatic arc, no shaping of the life into a good story.",
            "This new set presents the film in great quality and comes with some fantastic special features, but it's doubtful that this latest version of \"Alexander\" is going to change anyone's mind as to the quality of the film itself.",
            "For the lucky few that see this without ever having viewed the first cut, they may wonder what all the criticism was about in the first place.",

            "This is ultimately \"Alexander\" as written by Danielle Steele...",

            "This oracular piece of hero-worship is perhaps the squarest film yet from this once-hip director.",

            "Clearly, huge tankers of disbelief must be suspended in a sea of goodwill to get into the spirit of the film.",
            "The film is marred by too many coincidences, but there are a couple of twists at the end that tug at the heartstrings and leave you with a warm feeling.",
            "It's not lack of a strong story that keeps I Am David from taking off. Blame a straightforward approach that makes the movie feel too much like an after-school special.",
            "Feig's neorealist approach to the look of the film might work better if he didn't fill it with so many coincidences and melodramatic flourishes.",
            "I know, I know, I'm supposed to get sentimental about this heart-warming tale. But I couldn't believe a moment of it, and never identified with little David.",
            "At its best in the taut opening and in the third act, when the pieces finally come together. In between, the episodic story sags a bit.",
            "While some parents might wish the film had more emotional depth, they will probably appreciate the gentle humor. Then they can introduce their children to the book.",
            "Get out the Game Boy instead.",
            "It's like Tom Sawyer's Great Escape - a strange combination of stories that's interesting, but doesn't quite capture your emotions.",
            "It is not an especially brilliant film, nor does it execute its ideas with particular flair, and yet I cannot resist liking and being moved by it.",
            "A nice enough picture, but it's also slow and meandering. Watching it is like seeing a decent Family Channel movie, except in this case you have to pay for it.",
            "While probably not suitable for the wee ones, older kids and most adults will love this exciting and heartfelt adventure of one boy's survival during the darkest days of post-war Europe.",
            "How David escapes, alas, is less compelling than wondering how this drearily earnest movie escaped the Hallmark Channel. ",
            "While the material itself has promise (it's an adaptation of Anne Holm's best-selling novel), this drama fumbles and stumbles its way to a resolution that's far too easy.",
            "It's refreshing to watch a movie aimed at young people that's actually grounded in reality.",
            "One of those well-intentioned misfires that so frustrate both audiences and critics -- brimming with thematic potential, yet consistently unable to establish and maintain an effective tone.",
            "\"I Am David\" earns just about every teardrop it elicits. The journey isn't smooth, but that doesn't mean it isn't worthwhile.",
            "It's a Hallmark Hall of Fame special dressed up as a feature, one that juggles feel-good humanitarianism and oddly inappropriate stabs at whimsy.",
            "He knows there's so much drama and emotion in the story, it doesn't need schmaltzy dialogue or actors begging us to cry.",
            "Leaves you with the lingering scent of truth.",

            "As much as it is an examination of filmmaking, it's also a rather brilliant motivation to goad one friend into creative action, for, as we move along through the film, one can assume that Von Trier and Leth both seem to struggle with issues of depression.",
            "Von Trier is rejuvenating his mentor's imagination. He's also reminding him that art can 'catch the conscience' of the audience and the artist.",
            "[Leth's] strength against adversity elevates the movie above the one-sided whipping of a genial man to a more interesting duel of filmmakers. He parries when von Trier thrusts.",
            "This unique work does humanise the two directors, but also shows that these two fallible humans are capable of making wonderful if not perfect cinematic works.",
            "Somehow the humor and purpose of this project escaped me.",
            "Despite his own pessimism, I think Von Trier does change Leth as an artist, a little, through these chastisements.",
            "A hugely entertaining chess game between equally matched opponents.",
            "By challenging Leth, pushing him out of his comfort zone, von Trier releases in his idol a creative brilliance that would have otherwise remained buried.",

            "For those who treasure not only watching the intricate challenges of filmmaking but also feeling the thrill of tomfoolery and sharing the demonic joy of psychological twists, Obstructions is enthralling.",
            "A vain and vapid intellectual exercise that only serves to illustrate Lars von Trier's unswerving arrogance.",
            "The movie does almost all it can to refuse to appeal to the viewer, then gradually evolves into something profound and limit-busting.",

            "This Old Cub is admirable for its profile of a man who's still pushing on, even after all the adversity he faced.",

            "Easy to fall into, courtesy of the inviting, autumnal cinematography of Virginie Saint-Martin and the persuasive, committed and sensual performance of the title character, played by Emmanuelle Devos.",
            "Were Hitchcock alive, he'd surely claim the ripe and faintly sinister Devos as his muse.",
            "Told primarily via body language and facial expressions with a minimum of dialogue, beautifully observed, emotionally intense tale is an ambitious and rewarding outing for Frederic Fonteyne.",
            "Gilles' Wife is a disquieting film of frustrating subtlety. But Devos is a compelling presence at the heart of it. She, and the scenery that is her backdrop, make it worth the three espressos you'll need to drink to stay awake through it all.",
            "Like those '30 classics it suggests, Gilles' Wife seduces us with true cinematic magic: rich characters, great acting and that rapturous old French blend of realism and theatricality.",
            "I was fascinated by the face of Emmanuelle Devos, and her face is specifically why I recommend the movie.",
            "A small, perfect storm of beautiful components brought together by Fonteyne and his team.",
            "It's a French love story that's tragic (is there any other kind), but it does make you glad you're not in the middle of this menage a misery. It's definitely worth a look.",
            "While Devos provides a striking depth of emotion as Elisa, her skills aren't quite enough to keep the movie from feeling cold and distant.",
            "...there are copious rewards for the viewer who can let things unfold as they must.",
            "It comes off as reaching too far for originality, a sense that is only tied up with a ribbon by a completely dumb and desperate twist ending.",
            "Somehow, the plot remains emotionally coherent -- involving, even -- amid a minimum of dialogue.",
            "Fonteyne invests the material with a minimalist but powerful tension, and cinematographer Virginie Saint-Martin provides one beautifully composed visual after another.",
            "This is Devos' show: She has a face as expressive as any melodrama queen from Hollywood's golden age, and for anyone who's yet to experience the power of this singular performer, this is an excellent place to start.",
            "This is a lyrical art movie with admittedly limited commercial appeal, but worth seeing for cinematic explorers.",
            "Elisa remains strangely silent, in a mute display of masochism that is guaranteed to make contemporary hard-core feminists grind their teeth in furious frustration.",
            "Devos is especially adept at conveying raw emotion without saying a word. Painterly cinematography by Virginie Saint-Martin adds to the film's magic.",
            "The fascinating French actress Emmanuelle Devos stars as a woman in 1930's France who discovers her husband has developed a passion for another woman.",
            "Devos's performance is an expert workshop of internalized emotions and silent forbearance.",
            "Call it Through a Glass Fatuously.",
            "A thoughtful motion-picture about the inner workings of a woman's mind that is daringly melodramatic and as sparse with words as its photography is lush and colourful."

            "n the hyper-kinetic Kill Bill 1 you didn't know when the end happened, in Vol 2 you often wish the proceedings could hurtle to the finale, fast.",
            "Vol. 2 fills in the motivational and emotional blanks that left the first movie tasting like a meal made only of appetizers.",
            "I don't even want to do Tarantino and his pathetic accomplices the honour of recounting the narrative of the second \"volume\" of this exercise in trashpedalling, and frankly I don't need to, because there isn't a plot to speak of.",
            "Where KB1 had the pace of an ADHD six-year-old on a sugar high, KB2 has been Ritalinized, its tempo slowed to a crawl in self-conscious, and self-defeating, imitation of Sergio Leone. It's two hours that feel like five.",
            "If Kill Bill - Vol. 1 was like a roundhouse kick to the head, Vol. 2 is practically a warm hug.",
            "Sequel just as over-the-top explicitly violent.",
            "Not as electric as the first part, yet Tarantino excels by entertaining you with more words than punches. David Carradine is fantastic in quite the juicy, memorable role. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Carradine is fantastic as Bill, while Thurman deserves consideration for an Academy Award nomination with her performance as the Bride.",
            "Tarantino's attempt to inject a more solemn tone as the narrative reaches its climax creates an awkward mesh with the proceeding pulpiness.",
            "To watch a Tarantino film is to surrender wholeheartedly to his giddy genius, and this, his magnum opus, is no exception. ",
            "Where Volume 1 is about action, Volume 2 is talk, Tarantino's stock in trade, and it's good (if somewhat long winded) talk. It's also another roll call of Tarantino's cinematic loves ...",
            "It has its moments, and Thurman is an appealing heroine. But on the whole, this is a disjointed, disappointing and monstrously self-indulgent exercise.",
            "Although it's a gigantic shame that Miramax split Quentin Tarantino's long awaited 'kung-fu samurai Spaghetti Western love story' epic into two halves, \"Kill Bill Vol. 2\" pays off in spades...",
            "Quentin Tarantino revels in the art and craft of cinema; so much so he has managed to mine all his favourite genres and make the style the substance.",
            "Full of surprises and cinematic homage.",
            "If Kill Bill is a comeback film, Tarantino's future career prospects look about as good as Mike Tyson's. The Emperor's new clothes are showing.",
            "Though Vol. 2's body count is of necessity smaller than that of its predecessor, the brutality hurts more here, and counts for more.",
            "The Tarantino style has been copied a thousand times over since Pulp Fiction, what Kill Bill: Vol. 2 proves is that he's still the master.",
            "Much like the classic spaghetti Westerns and kung fu flicks, Tarantino paradoxically manages to glorify and condemn the violence of his characters.",
            "Tarantino is killing off his mentors - directors who have passed or should have passed the torch long ago - to pave the future of cinema.",
            "Those turned off by the first part's reckless, relentless violent purges aren't likely to find cause for conversion, but Vol. 2 certainly broadens the tale's remit, even as it aims to deepen it.",
            "He saved the best for last.",
            "Soulless.",
            "The second movie's action is limited to 2-3 fights, the rest are long conversations and introspection. It is a far bleaker, more serious and dry affair -- but also a more fascinating character study."

            "Needless to say a must-see for Wongcolytes, Days of Being Wild is also an excellent entry point for people who haven't yet caught this most exotic and habit-forming of cinematic bugs.",

            "It now seems like a promising apprentice work, almost a blueprint for the writer-director's most acclaimed and famous film, In the Mood for Love.",
            "There are images in Days that can make your heart stop for no other reason than that they're perfect.",
            "It may have been released in the olden days of 1991, but Wong Kar-Wai's Days of Being Wild remains pulsatingly contemporary.",
            "A triumph of movie pop poetics.",
            "These days are both electric and exhausted.",
            "A dark moody period piece about unrequited love.",
            "Twelve years after first seeing Days of Being Wild, I'm finally developing some fondness for it.",
            "The '60s were a time of alienation and sadness, which I suppose Wong was trying to reflect here. But he's chosen characters so monumentally self-destructive that it's difficult to care about them.",
            "Unless the film is pure homage, the film lacks authenticity ",
            "Wong has a reputation for slow-moving mood pieces in which very little happens, but that's not the case here.",
            "Wong's always-striking visual style uses floating, neon colors and extreme angles to emphasize disconnected souls.",
            "The languorous atmosphere of longing, disconnection and emotional isolation is hypnotic.",
            "A heady mix of sex, obsession, alienation and angst.",
            "Feels exciting, in part, because you are watching an auteur lay the groundwork -- with an assortment of clocks, watches and meticulously detailed moments -- for ideas and moods he will obsessively follow in later films.",
            "In many ways, Days of Being Wild anticipated the overall pattern of its writer-director- auteur's haunting career.",
            "Wong creates a dream state of shifting, stalling, liquid time, a kind of gauzy unreality that made In the Mood for Love so seductive.",
            "A rapturous film about cool men, hot women and the thousand and one nights and cigarettes they share.",
            "It's inexplicable that Wong's early masterpiece has been virtually absent from American screens since he completed it in 1991.",
            "Arguably this is the key movie in Wong's oeuvre, as startling in its context as Hiroshima Mon Amour and Breathless were in theirs."

            "This white trash fairytale is no masterpiece, but its sinister otherworldliness deserves to be applauded. ",

            "Even as Broomfield inserts himself (as usual) into the narrative, Wuornos grabs the spotlight with all of her wild-eyed fury.",

            "[Weinstock] does an impressive job of capturing the brave messiness of single life, or at least of 20-something dating.",
            "The movie ends on exactly the right note, but it hits a lot of bad ones on the way.",
            "It is a lively, idiosyncratic romantic comedy, funny and sexy but with a strong serious streak.",

            "It's easy to pan Easy as a second-rate effort to make a first-rate indie movie. But you may come away well satisfied with your hour and a half's entertainment.",
            "Jane Weinstock certainly has talent, and Marguerite Moreau deserves more opportunities to shine as a lead, but the longer Easy goes on, the less of that talent you see.",
            "Weinstock adds such realism to her script and such great characters, you can't help but like this film even if it does sort of follow a formula.",
            "Weinstock takes you down a well-trod path in romantic comedy, but her characters are smart and funny, the twists are unexpected and, for once, a romantic triangle is presented realistically with the choice a woman must face being anything but easy."

            "It is clear that as a filmmaker Todd Stephens, like his heroes and heroines, is determined to be true to himself.",
            "Saga is especially sapped of its appeal and energy by the toxically charmless titular character whose central obsession -- dressing up like Stevie Nicks and singing her material -- is curiously wedged between comedy and oddity.",
            "The narrative momentum may sputter, but the vivid performances keep the film from dragging.",
            "The true joy of this indie stems from the well observed friendship between Gypsy and her Goth plaything, Clive. The chemistry between the two young actors is near-wondrous. ",

            "Lurid, tawdry and untoward entertainment from Canada's reigning mad genius.",
            "It's bliss, I tell you!",

            "What's truly extraordinary about this movie -- which strikes me on two viewings as Maddin's masterpiece -- is that it not only plays like a dream but feels like one.",
            "Shot in five days, \"Cowards Bend The Knee\" is not exactly automatic writing-Maddin knows exactly which Greek tragedies he's pillaging-but it feels like a direct flood from the unconscious. His most dreamlike film, it's also his most heartfelt.",
            "... a miniature, barely more than an hour long... but it bubbles over with lust, guilt, and betrayal, not to mention weirdness.",

            "If you're a fan of Maddin's expressionist style, you'll find the humor within. Everyone else will be scratching their heads, despite Maddin's extraordinary visual imagination.",

            "There's a new visual idea every second, each teeming with energy, pitch-dark comedy, and inspired cinematic lunacy.",

            "Most of Maddin's usual preoccupations are in evidence -- guilt, incest, sexual obsession, voyeurism, early cinema and Maddin's greatest love, hockey -- and as luridly entertaining as ever.",
            "One of the most brilliant works of an unapologetically eccentric, and endlessly inventive, director.",
            "Cowards Bend the Knee is paradoxically retrograde and ultramodern.",
            "Even by the standards of Maddin's past works, it is a unique creation -- intense, ridiculous, but also deeply personal.",

            "For some, Pappas' film will simply confirm everything they've suspected of the fourth estate. For others, it will be a reiteration of points they make themselves. Those who've never thought about these issues may be in for the shock of their lives.",
            "Comes across as a political science course videotape rather than a movie to fully engage a general audience.",
            "Enlightening, at times disturbing, and always provocative.",
            "The war against the neo-fascists still goes on, and the outcome at this point is far from certain. Mr. Pappas' film does its part.",
            "Every incident mentioned in the film was reported in the media, sometimes ad nauseam, and the polls show that about half of Americans like where things are going.",
            "A cheaply made, occasionally repetitive, but passionately argued documentary.",
            "[N]one of this is news. But seeing it laid out so bare... is infuriating.",
            "Orwell's predictions have come sadly true.",
            "Professors, pundits, journalists and one elected official, Representative Bernie Sanders (I-VT), rigorously examine the issue of maintaining a free press in an environment in which journalists are increasingly the employees of major corporations.",

            "...it sometimes goes off into areas that, while interesting, are pretty tangential. Still, it makes a good (and scary) case.",
            "Even though he refuses to excise about 15 to 20 minutes of unnecessary material, Pappas is nonetheless a steady editor who, less intrepid than dogged, pieces together a sustainably intriguing, suitably distressing expos\u00e9.",
            "A bracing eye-opener to anyone who hasn't considered the full implications of recent Congressional debates advocating further media deregulation, debates that, unsurprisingly, have been strikingly underreported by mainstream news outlets.",
            "Attacking network news seems almost quaintly beside the point at a time when the networks are hemorrhaging viewers, losing more and more eyeballs to cable, the Internet and, apparently, our nation's new habit of staring blankly into space.",
            "Get ready for a cultural wake-and-shake you won't forget for a long, long time.",
            "The persuasion of Pappas' argument lies in the accumulation of original documentation, allowing the political perps to condemn themselves with their own words.",
            "Be prepared to be shocked, infuriated, depressed, and terrified.",
            "Offers little that is not also explored in current agit-docs like Fahrenheit 9/11, The Corporation, or Outfoxed.",
            "Presents the bad news about the media monopolies and the many ways they are busy shredding the most precious principles of democracy.",
            "Folks, Orwell probably is rolling in his grave, not because 1984 has come to be, but because his name is attached to such a lousy movie.",
            "A marvel of passionate succinctness, Robert Kane Pappas' docu critically examines the Fourth Estate, once the bastion of American democracy.",
            "An incredible collection of documentation and first hand testimony as to what is happening to us behind our backs -- and under our noses.",
            "If Pappas's aesthetic is on the rudimentary side, it's more than made up for by his sheer force of will."

            "This is a film about human beings who can be flawed and prickly but if you go a little deeper, you will see beauty. This is a wonderfully written script, with a great performance by Paul Giamatti.",
            "Payne does know how to capture two kinds of male menopause. But I can't say he ever surprised me.",
            "Excellent but explicit movie is not for kids.",
            "Sideways stays resolutely life-size. And that, in this age of hype and hyperventilation, may be the most radical thing about it.",
            "Brilliantly observed characters are becoming second nature to Payne and Taylor, and the performances here are uniformly terrific. This is wonderful, original stuff.",
            "A study of friendship, disappointment and self-deception, Sideways, directed by Alexander Payne, has at its centre the most leisurely of bachelor parties: it's a road movie that stops off at vineyards.",
            "It is a powerfully written story captured onscreen by Alexander Payne with a wondrous humanity and sensitivity.",
            "Funny, touching, and features perhaps the best ensemble work of any film in recent memory. And like fine wine, the movie ages well upon reflection.",
            "A film that not only demands to be sampled but to be gulped down and savored like the vintage draft that it is.",
            "Unfolding at a relaxed tempo, and unobtrusively edited, Sideways is a welcome throwback to 1970s Bob Rafelson and Jerry Schatzberg. ",
            "Where Payne's fondness for template narratives has started to become a problem, Sideways - as the title evinces - has much a more complex take on the possibility of catharsis ",
            "A beautiful little chamber dramedy about four sharply-drawn characters played with a very lovely mixture of nuance and showmanship.",
            "Payne's most enjoyable movie since Election",
            "\"Sideways\" is about wine aged to perfection sipped by men who've aged to mediocrity - softer, hornier versions of Walter and The Dude. But Miles's brutal honesty is its soul. He's annoyingly, depressingly out there, but never fraudulent.",
            "Giamatti handily raises what could've been a pedestrian road trip romance into the stratosphere of a world-class character study",
            "A very memorable slice of life.",
            "This wonderfully satisfying study in human nature is funny and sad and profoundly entertaining from start to finish.",
            "Sideways is the first of Payne's films in which we have the chance to really care for the characters; he reins in his harsh satire better than before.",
            "No one does quivering-on-the-edge-of-depression quite like Paul Giamatti.",
            "This one's like to appeal greatly to the 30-40 somethings that are getting more and more into bourgeois sports such as yachting, polo or wine tasting.",
            "The year's second best movie about broken and lonely people (after Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind).",
            "In Payne's overarching triumph, Sideways is a sensitive, to the point of disturbing, expose of love....love that can blossom with that high school hallway sweetness even in the withered garden of midlife.",

            "It's a great concept -- but it's done in by an unfocused and uninspired presentation.",

            "Gilbert's great achievement lies in his integration of disparate historical threads and voices into one steadily paced, riveting tale.",
            "Speed doesn't boast much in the way of innovative storytelling. What it does offer is a story that still badly needs to be told.",
            "The film is at its most quietly powerful ... when telling the story of a group of African-American high school kids who took their discontent to the highest court in the land.",
            "America moves imperfectly toward the goal of equality, but because of Brown vs. Board of Education, it moves.",
            "Rather than merely chronicling the events leading up to the May 17, 1954, Supreme Court decision ... the film explores both its effect and ways in which it has fallen short in creating true equality.",
            "Peter Gilbert's documentary tells the story leading up to the Supreme Court's historical 1954 decision in the Brown v. Board of Education case.",
            "As a document of his history, it's breathtaking, inspiring stuff. As an overlong documentary, it still manages to be inspiring, but also an uphill viewing experience.",
            "The events themselves, captured in vital newsreel footage of the period, speak volumes, as perhaps does their unfinished legacy.",
            "While the filmmaker avoids a conventional episodic format driven by central characters in conflict, he hasn't created one that could keep a complex story clear."

            "The need to portray the powers-that-be at all levels -- from the Vatican to the local parish -- in the worst possible light intrudes upon the movie, making it feel like a personal vendetta.",
            "Certainly a debate over the church's tradition of an unmarried clergy ... could be a good and worthy one. But a quick, clumsy melodrama -- complete with awkward, pop-scored sex scenes -- isn't the best venue.",
            "While the subject of enforced priestly celibacy is important, here it is dealt with in a workman-like manner lacking vibrancy.",
            "Deery's points are well-taken, but they would have been a lot better made if he hadn't taken so many easy shots at the church by demonizing its local authorities.",
            "Catholic nay-sayers will probably have a field day with the movie, but most would be better served by any one of the numerous documentaries that cover the same topic.",
            "The kind of film that has its heart in the right place: exposing corruption. But it loses credibility by doing so in a melodramatic way.",

            "An often-riveting film.",
            "The limp thriller plot Deery constructs to frame his theological inquiries is both artificial and not very interesting, a lethal combination.",
            "For American audiences who have followed recent Church scandals, this less-than-penetrating expos\u00e9 will be of mild interest.",
            "John Deery's modest drama is one big, obvious argument against the vow of celibacy for Roman Catholic priests, but it has heart.",
            "For a salting of sex and foul language, John Decry's investigative thriller plays like third-tier P.D. James adapted for TV.",
            "As stacked as any more secular nonfiction agitprop from the recent election season.",
            "The story meanders, but the subject is timely and important.",
            "Conspiracy of Silence is a thoughtful drama about some of the formidable challenges faced by reform-minded Catholics who dare to question the tradition of celibacy.",
            "It's unclear whether this is an actual issue, or just something spicy to be cooked up in the potboiler.",

            "Wassel's reach exceeds his grasp: The film's storytelling is choppy and sometimes obscures important relationships, and not all of the actors are capable of the emotional range that would give their characters convincingly tragic dimensions.",

            "Somewhat entertaining, but too scary for many.",
            "Played by Ron Perlman, he's the most magnetic action hero I've come across in a long while, though I couldn't make heads or tails of this story.",
            "Unfortunately, after setting up this fresh blue-collar scenario in the movie's first hour, Del Toro wallows in pyrotechnics.",
            "Del Toro, in love with his source but never overawed by it, keeps things moving; Perlman ties it together with some of the driest witticisms this side of Indiana Jones. Like we said: fun.",
            "The film deserves recognition for its innovative approach to visuals in a comic book adaptation, but loses points for trite dialogue from many of the supporting characters.",
            "A rare intelligent and shrewd adaptation of a comic book, taking risks without taking its audience for granted.",
            "There's a freshness and goofiness about Hellboy that defies the precision and exactitude of Guillermo del Toro's direction.",
            "Ron Perlman, performing under a massive ember-red suit... is perfect as the cigar-puffing, wisecracking, kitten-loving demon who covertly battles supernatural monsters.",
            "Guillermo del Toro's best film yet.",
            "It would be quite impossible to claim is that the filmmaker's love of his subject isn't apparent throughout every lovingly-crafted frame.",
            "Probably one of the coolest comic book movies to come around in years...",
            "The screenplay has flashes of real wit, and Perlman is perfect in the title role.",
            "Inventive but derivative, well performed yet slightly hokey, visually lush yet over-stylised.",
            "Anyone can send an immense, computer-generated vegetable monster rampaging at the base of the Brooklyn Bridge, but it takes a special kind of imagination to do it in a way that's thrilling, emotionally complex, and rapturously beautiful all at once.",
            "High concept fantasy through the eyes of creative genius of Guillermo del Toro",
            "Hellboy both kicks butt and falls in love, in an adventure that is thrilling, funny and touching.",
            "A strong anti-superhero movie that turns the genre sideways.",
            "Del Toro and Perlman essentially make you forget that Hellboy's this bizarre creature because Perlman invests him with such humanity. And maybe what makes him most human are his flaws.",
            "Ron Perlman--the Lon Chaney of our time--plays Hellboy with grit, humor, and a depth of feeling which, barely, grounds the movie.",
            "They say the devil gets all the best tunes and, on the strength of this latest comicbook adaptation, he gets all the good one-liners, too.",
            "Artistically resonant even as it deliberately follows a contemporary narrative structure.",
            "Perlman, at age 53, strides in like a hungry young actor itching to prove something, only with 22 years of experience lending him charisma and confidence."

            "[A] comedy so broad it barely dents its targets and a patronising moral conclusion that goes against everything its protagonists originally stood for.",
            "This isn't a wonderful life: It looks pretty hellish.",

            "Makes the colossal mistake of making Luther's obsession seem almost a valid protest against conformity -- then lets the neighbors not only win but claim the moral high ground.",
            "Allen was a bit low energy for my liking but actually came off better in his more sincere scenes towards the end of the film.",
            "We loved him as Santa. We loved her as the hooker with a heart. We love Christmas. ... After seeing Christmas with the Kranks, all I can say is it put me in one kranky mood for the holidays over such a waste of talent!",
            "Forget the 12 Days of Christmas; there are at least 12,000 ways that 2004's fascistic Christmas with the Kranks earns the honor as the worst Yuletide film ever made.",
            "Christmas With The Kranks is the sort of film that leaves you thinking Ebenezer Scrooge might have had the right idea about the festive season.",
            "A grueling experience.",
            " The notion of bullying people into succumbing into the trappings of Christmas does not necessarily represent goodwill to all, and while the situations present good comic opportunities, the film ends up feeling rather manipulative and sugary.",
            "Some pathetically predictable plot twists and syrupy sentimentality, which could only amuse a five year-old, lead the Kranks back to their materialistic senses in time for a Kodak moment which shouts a rather shallow Merry Capitalism to all!",
            "A more sweet than sour satire that sets its sight on nasty but lavishly honey coated underpinnings of the holiday season.",
            "There is not a single lifelike character in the entire picture.",
            "It is a perfectly fine, inoffensive family comedy.",

            "Contains momentum-halting continuity errors and clownish antics from hammy performers that will have Santa scribbling furiously on next year's \"Naughty\" list."

            "Hypocritically smears the very mascara it wears.",
            "There are some neat lessons here, but they unfortunately get lost inside the wooden writing and character development. ",
            "It's not a perfect film, and nor does it have much that you've not seen before. You can predict it, you're unlikely to be surprised, but it's glossy and slick, and very easy to watch.",
            "Garner makes the most of this humble, good-natured rom-com, propelling it from the minor leagues to the majors.",
            "13 Going on 30, directed with a sweet touch by Gary Winick (Tadpole), is an immensely likable if unchallenging comedy.",
            "Overall the tale is flimsy and predictable, but it's buoyant and engaging enough not to matter.",
            "13 Going on 30 is best when it's adorable.",
            "A sweet little fantasy that lacks the bite of Big, the film''s just a pleasant getaway. Nothing more.",
            "[Jennifer Garner] makes you really feel like there's a 13 year old girl in that body.",
            "It's silly fun with a soundtrack full of 1980s hits and plenty of ridiculous fashion.",
            "There's not a lot of originality to this film.",
            "Jennifer Garner breaks character by forgetting that she's playing an awkward 13-year-old girl in a 30-year-old woman's body in this girly comedy",
            "Naive as its young heroine, but also as good-natured. [Blu-ray]",
            "The sheer predictability of the plot means it doesn't really stand up to the scrutiny of anyone older than 15.",
            "A radiant woman looking like she's having the time of her life makes up for a lot of inconsistencies.",
            "A rehash of familiar material, but the engaging Garner is charismatic enough to make it magical.",
            "While [it's] the Keystone Light of Vice Versa movies, it also annoyingly adds itself to the ever-growing list of movies that think being kitschy about the 1980s is funny.",
            "Alias superspy Jennifer Garner makes the most of her first starring role and discovers that love -- and navigating adult life -- really is a battlefield."

            "Happily, this extremely timely entertainment matches, even perhaps surpasses its predecessor.",
            "Impressively accomplished and highly entertaining, with sufficiently smart new twists to keep you guessing all the way to the nerve-wracking climax.",
            "An exhilarating, if politically wishy-washy, modern-day reimagining of Frankenheimer's gem.",
            "Demme's 2004 remake, which moved the action into the present day and cast Denzel Washington, Liev Schreiber and Meryl Streep in the key roles...tweaked the ending just enough to make things feel even more hopeless.",
            "Disappointing remake of the classic 1962 thriller.",
            "What gets less attention but is no less true is how effective Demme can be when focusing on people stripped of their humanity, either by choice or force.",
            "The surprises surprised me so much that I am not sure I have quite mastered the plot yet. It is all excellent fun but, as with the original, not serious.",
            "If it isn't the original's equal, The Manchurian Candidate conjures up an air of menace sufficient to make most modern thrillers look like romantic comedies.",
            "This humorless and nonsensical update of The Manchurian Candidate - a total misread of Frankenheimer's classic original - never quite engages, devolving the original's camp and satire into self-serious melodrama. ",
            "A rather decent imitation in the end with political subtext and very good performances.",
            "It is as shocking now as it was forty years ago, but nothing in the 2004 version approaches that level of intensity, intelligence, or audacity.",
            "Demme's direction is as punctilious as it was in Silence of the Lambs, careful with details and craftsmanlike with storytelling -- although we do have to work a bit to stay on top of things.",
            "The original film worked also as delicious satire, where this wannabe cousin to Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 ignites unintentional laughs.",
            "...an above-average contemporary remake...",
            "Demme's filmmaking has lost none of its jazz.",
            "With an inchoate admonition implanted in its aggrieved, post-modern heart, Demme's Manchurian Candidate is blippy and fractured and smeared with color.",
            "The movie is playing with ideas, and they're important enough to bear thinking about now. What it's playing on are our fears. And they're real enough, and worth addressing.",
            "A superb piece of filmmaking by directing icon Jonathan Demme that surpasses the John Frankenheimer original in ways I didn't think possible.",
            "What is surprising is how fresh Demme's version is and how close it approaches the original in terms of quality.",
            "the ending is mother of all disappointments",
            "The film starts out as a taut, psychological thriller with a keen analysis of today's politics, but it eventually begins to slack off into third-rate originality."

            "...light entertainment, but offers only a shallow insight into war.",

            "Can a movie be too well made for its own good? Stylish and painterly, with moments of great lyricism, it flies over the Spanish countryside to the sea...the film does everything in its power to escape the claustrophobia inherent in the story.",
            "Bardem is simply astounding as Sampedro.",
            "If ever there was a film that deserved to get the proverbial bump from Oscar, this is it. Rarely has any film so focused on death felt so vibrantly alive.",
            "For whatever reason, it's an injustice that Bardem was not nominated for best actor.",
            "Bardem's Ram\u00f3n is such a vital life force, it's all the more bittersweet to watch him fight to leave a world that would be much emptier and sadder without him in it.",
            "Ultimately, this is one man's story, told with great empathy, and Amen\u00e1bar deserves great credit for lifting the film above the soap-opera sentimentality into which it could have easily fallen.",
            "Javier Bardem gives the performance of the year and barely has to lift a finger to do it. ",
            "I think that one of the fundamental keys of 'The Sea inside' is precisely to create characters with which the public feels identified from the first second. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "[VIDEO ESSAY] Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar's seamless depiction of Ram\u00f3n Sampedro's battle for his own sense of integrity arrives in refreshing cinematic terms. ",
            "Fascinating story too complex for young viewers.",
            "It's a good movie. It's just not a movie for which I can work up much personal enthusiasm.",
            "The performances are heartbreaking, the story both tragic and uplifting - Amenabar has crafted yet another movie that's sure to please many.",
            "The production itself is so rich in authentic emotional life and breathtaking visuals, word of mouth and positive reviews should carry the (pay) day.",
            "Bio-pic chronicles quadriplegic Ramon's Sampredo's 28-year crusade to legalize euthanasia in order that he be allowed to die with dignity.",
            "The film is worth seeing, but only if you're prepared to set aside your aversion to its polemic in order to experience its compassion.",
            "An intelligent and moving treatment of a potentially maudlin subject matter.",
            "what could have been unrelieved morbid dreariness becomes, in the hands of Amenabar, a provocative and unexpectedly life-affirming story...",
            "The result, as imagined by Amen\u00e1bar, who co-wrote the screenplay with Mateo Gil, is like watching the human spirit flash before your eyes.",
            "The acting in the film is superb, especially by Bardem, who richly deserved his Academy Award nomination.",
            "Javier Bardem gives a remarkable, delicately honed performance.",
            "Rare is the motion picture which grapples with issues this provocative and profound. Rarer still is one which does so this well."

            "Works better as a sports movie than a love match.",
            "All in all, it's rather pleasant, but nothing else.",
            "The movie needs the stars' charm and director Richard Loncraine's polish, because the faulty script is just barely good enough to hold us for 100 minutes.",
            "Lobs nothing but clich\u00e9s.",
            "A pleasant enough entertainment at a time when movies either pleasant or entertaining are in short supply.",
            "Bettany is charming, and thankfully he and Dunst are appealing together.",
            "I cared about the resolution of the film, and the closure for these characters. ",
            "An enjoyable little crowd-pleaser with likable leads and a few good laughs.",
            "The story plays out predictably with a happy ending -- think The Natural on Wimbledon's Centre Court -- and all in all, it's a decent romantic comedy.",
            "You aren't likely to see a film with more warmth and good humor anytime soon, or one that does more to give feel good filmmaking a good name.",
            "Do we really need to see another film where a gorgeous, talented and desired American woman is whisked away by a stammering insecure British man with an inner monologue?",
            "Bettany and Dunst make a cute couple that is as fiercely competitive in their love lives as they are on the court.",
            "Trillada? Relativamente Complaciente? Absolutamente Buena? Podr vivir sin verla. Pero definitivamente si la ve... saldr gratamente complacido.",
            "Wimbledon ends up playing on wet clay...",
            "N\u00e3o \u00e9 um filme inovador, \u00e9 verdade, mas foi competente o bastante para fazer com que eu me importasse com o destino do casal principal sem ficar entediado durante o processo.",
            "As predictable and impotent as a John McEnroe outburst.",
            "No amount of charm on the part of the stars can overcome the pall of generic conventions used in such a rote manner.",
            "Ably, consistently directed and featuring attractive, likeable leads, yet also still so formulaic and quirk-free as to lull you into a stupor.",
            "Joins 'Four Weddings and a Funeral,' 'Notting Hill' and 'About a Boy' in that distinctly British niche of 'chick flicks' that can be enjoyed without a lobotomy."
