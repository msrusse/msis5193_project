            "Spielberg has come up with another rousing piece of entertainment.",
            "With the action nonstop there is no time for mere acting, much less for a coherent plot.",
            "Again you will savor the Indiana Jones schizophrenia: by day a bow-tied, bespectacled archaeologist; by night a resourceful swaggerer, whom Ford brings to life as a modern blend of Bogie and the Duke, with just a glint of misfit psychopathy in his eyes.",
            "It's not the darker turn that makes The Temple of Doom uncomfortable at times; it's its mean-spiritedness.",
            "Pic comes on like a sledgehammer, and there's even a taste of vulgarity and senseless excess not apparent in Raiders.",
            "The film betrays no human impulse higher than that of a ten-year-old boy trying to gross out his baby sister by dangling a dead worm in her face.",
            "The film as a whole feels like an insignificant episode in Indy's life, instead of an influential chapter in the evolution of the action genre.",
            "Speaks to a bravery to experiment which Temple of Doom embraced one last time.",
            "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom may have some impressive features but it's nowhere near as classic as Raiders or the Last Crusade.",
            "Some tonal miscues and a clumsy love story can't derail action this good, this breath-taking.",
            "The strangest... most broken... most tonally discordant of the Indiana Joneses, and for all these reasons it is the one that feels the most like its own thing.",
            "This movie is batshit insane.",
            "A fun and worthy sequel that really continues the harrowing but exciting exploits of Indiana Jones...",
            "an unbelievably crass, unpleasant, horrific picture",
            "More gore, gross-outs than the other Indy blockbusters.",
            "...an obvious step down from its stellar predecessor...",
            "[T]he best of the Indiana Jones movies...it's insanely wonderful, in every sense of those words.",
            "It lacks the sense of detail that made Raiders such a treat. It isn't very clever, very funny or very compelling.",
            "The reality is that this is the film that comes closest to reflecting the racism, sexism and jingoism that fuelled most of the serials that originally sparked Spielberg and George Lucas's impressionable young imaginations.",
            "Where the brilliant \"Raiders\" was an adventure film aimed at the child at heart, \"Temple of Doom\" is really designed for the kiddie market itself.",
            "If it was a sign of the times for Indiana Jones to take on more of a comic-book aspect, the film's accomodation of darker themes and explicit imagery came as something of a shock to many.",
            "...makes you wonder if Spielberg and series producer George Lucas might have been going through some sort of drug phase.",
            "While 'The Temple of Doom' is a bit gloomy, puts children in danger, and confines its action primarily to one spot, it's still quite entertaining. (Blu-ray edition)",
            "A breakneck adventure that moves at twice the pace of the original but has only half the creative strength."

            "This 1984 film's few and unimpressive special effects evidently qualify it as science fiction, but the genre it really belongs to is the male weepie: there hasn't been a gooier buddy romance on the screen since Joe Buck took Ratso Rizzo to Miami.",

            "This would-be epic schlep, dragging almost 50 years of chronology over a sluggish 140 minutes, is far too slight of text and ponderous of presentation to sustain more than nodding-off dramatic interest.",
            "Adding 22 minutes only enhances Leone's brilliant saga of guilt and betrayal",
            "Sergio Leone's languid, lovely and lengthy ode to Lower East Side mobsters (more specifically, mobster films) ...",
            "Leone is less interested in arousing an audience's easier emotions than in presenting, at a dispassionate distance, the horror of two men warily walking toward each other on a tightrope suspended above the snake pit of their , deepest compulsions.",
            "Every gesture is immediate, and every gesture seems eternal.",
            "...an epic of blinkered nostalgia.",
            "The cinematographic style has evolved, but it's still unmistakably reminiscent of his earlier projects.",
            "A stratosphere-scraping citadel of cinema, nearly everything about Leone's last film - and greatest masterwork - speaks to the grand illusion of the American Dream. ",
            "Complex gangster epic has strong violence, sex. ",
            "A tale of haunting introspection, unremitting power and potent symbolism. \"America\" ruminates on the corrosive effects of greed, violence, objectification and pain, and forces us to face despicable acts of a stand-in for our nation's worst impulses.",
            "While Sergio Leone's \"Once Upon a Time in America\" is not quite the masterpiece that some make it out to be due to its excess, there are still plenty of things to recommend about it.",
            "The film, photographed by Tonino Delli Colli, is striking to look at, especially its New York street scenes, which were shot in Manhattan, Montreal and a back lot near Rome. The acting is stunning.",
            "Just gasp at the scale, at the immaculate period reconstruction and at that incredible opening with its endlessly ringing phone.",
            "A striking tale of loyalty, love, friendship and ambition, Once Upon A Time is a work of technical beauty and sombre emotion.",
            "Sergio Leone explores the seamiest byways of urban Americana through the story of two gangsters who start their partnership as Brooklyn kids in 1921 and tragically end it in the late '60s.",
            "A work of tremendous intellectual depth and emotional range",
            "Here was a filmmaker who specialized in pure, blistering images, and this operatic earthiness just doesn't play as well as the horrifying, salacious stuff. ",
            "Sad and vast yet compelling throughout, this remain Leone's most towering achievement.",
            "Handsomely mounted beyond a shadow of a doubt, but as the final statement in Leone's career, it mostly makes me think of how fantastic his Westerns were.",
            "While The Godfather delivers certainty and a comforting dramatic resolution, Once Upon A Time In America delivers a profound kind of mystery.",
            "In a post The Godfather world, for Leone to even consider taking on an epically scoped New York gangster film took tremendous courage if not foolishness, Coppola had set the bar at an impossible height.",
            "A disappointment of considerable proportions.",
            "Spaghetti western master Sergio Leone turns his eye toward an American gangster epic spanning 50 years with surprisingly positive results."

            "It's a rambunctious comedy, coming from director Ron Howard who, with his previous, wacky Night Shift, unarguably shows that beneath that Opie Taylor/Richie Cunningham persona, there's a wild and crazy spirit.",
            "A romantic comedy that is as salty and bracing as a plunge in the surf.",
            "Although film is a bit uneven, production benefits from a tasty look, an airy tone, and a delectable, unblemished performance from Hannah.",
            "Howard demonstrates exactly the correct soft touch, skirting the myriad problems of taste.",
            "It's too bad the relentlessly conventional minds that made this movie couldn't have made the leap from sitcom to comedy.",
            "Manages plenty of laugh-out-loud moments and genuine fun.",
            "Splash could have been a silly and simple comedy, but it escapes that destiny thanks to its creative script and talented actors. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "A mild and bland slapstick Disney comedy.",
            "Line up a row of Howard's films and ask someone to choose. Chances are, their hands will fall to Splash as often as any other",
            "This charming romantic comedy touched a chord with audiences around the world and propelled its stars Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah, along with director Ron Howard, to Hollywood's front rank.",
            "Fishy fairy tale the wrong hook on relationships.",
            "Director Ron Howard has a good sense of the whimsical, and his film is sweet and unpretentious, though somewhat ribald when one realizes the studio from whence it sprang.",
            "The movie that really showed Tom Hanks' promise as a deliverer of great comedy and heart-warming pathos.",
            "Hannah does wonders with her thankless job, flitting tiny moments of joy and confusion across her face.",
            "It's all been downhill from here for Ron Howard",
            "Very dated, but still fun",
            "Splash is a light-hearted comedy directed by Ron Howard that sparkles here and there thanks to its fairy tale elements. ",
            "Splash is probably the ultimate fish-out-of-water film, primarily because it literally features a fish out of water.",
            "The movie is cute, light, and fluffy, perhaps not the laugh-fest I had remembered but enough to get by.",

            "Reiner, with McKean, Guest and Harry Shearer, have done a great job in creating and portraying characters that are dimwitted, cliched and yet oddly endearing.",
            "For music biz insiders, This Is Spinal Tap is a vastly amusing satire of heavy metal bands.",
            "For all its japes and jokes, the movie is really about exhaustion of the spirit: sitting in a bleak hotel suite at 4 a.m. with the bad taste of last night in the mouth and the feeling that tomorrow will not be a better day.",
            "The material is consistently clever and funny, though ultimately the attitudes are too narrow to nourish a feature-length film.",
            "Reiner's brilliantly inventive script and smart visuals avoid all the obvious pitfalls, making this one of the funniest ever films about the music business.",
            "It stays so wickedly close to the subject that it is very nearly indistinguishable from the real thing.",
            " Little riffs of comic genius can be heard amidst the heavy-metal cacophony of This is Spinal Tap...",
            "Documenting the licks and antics of a real band is one thing. Building a movie around a fake one is a challenge of a different order. The key, as Spinal Tap proved, is to fabricate a band that looks, acts and sounds at least as good as the real thing.",
            "This is Spinal Tap is hilarious to everyone who's not a musician. Because as ridiculous and perverse as Rob Reiner's heavy metal mockumentary gets, the slim, 82-minute comedy gnaws at more truths than any other rock 'n' roll biopic put to celluloid.",
            "Yes Nigel, you did go to 11. Where would cinematic comedy be if you hadn't?",
            "Consistently funny, with sheer brilliant turns from every performer on the cast...",
            "Returning to Spinal Tap always brings with it a pronounced sense of discovery, a freshness that is uncommon with movies generally and unspeakably rare in a comedy.",
            "[VIDEO] Although examples of the mockumentary genre existed before \"Spinal Tap\" this heavy metal comedy is considered an epitome of cinematic satire. ",
            "If you didn't know this was a fake film, you could easily believe it's real.",
            "...a sporadically amusing but all-too-uneven piece of work...",
            "Hilarious, ribald, drug-filled rock send-up.",
            "The original suffers upon review simply because its novelty has worn off. But being the first mainstream feature of its kind, it deserves due reverence.",
            "The story of an embarrasingly inept heavy-metal band called Spinal Tap, Rob Reiner's film set the mockumentary standard that has come to define much of modern screen comedy. [Blu-ray]",
            "Scores an 11 (out of 10) for sheer inspired lunacy but it's the writers' unexpected fondness for their subject matter that puts the film in a class all its own.",
            "Hilarious, bitingly perceptive and cinematically assured.",
            "Mildly funny, not a whole lot better than the best Christopher Guest mockumentary I'd seen before this, 'Best in Show.'",
            "There had been countless documentary spoofs before This Is Spinal Tap, but this inspired put-on was the first to actually capture the texture and style of real documentary.",
            "Hilarious pseudo-documentary spoof of a British rock group that was so on-target in its satire, many viewers took it for the real thing.",
            "This superb satire became the standard against which all mockumentaries are evaluated. The film was so successful that the fictitious group reunited for a series of live concerts and a TV special, further blurring the line between real and reel."

            "Catharsis on the cheap; there's no reason to accept the pretense that the hero has suffered much and changed for the better unless you're predisposed to get swoony over Prince himself.",
            "Rock star Prince makes an impressive feature film debut in Purple Rain, a rousing contemporary addition to the classic backstage musical genre.",
            "Prince's 1984 movie debut seems more like his deification, with an aggressively stupid plot line that serves only to set him up as a paragon of artistic integrity, sexual prowess, and superhuman sensitivity.",
            "A hokey but mesmerizing rock-video psychodrama.",
            "Not much about Purple Rain should work - and yet everything does.",
            "Transcendent music can cover a multitude of sins...",
            "Perhaps the grossly simplistic and unsubtle misogyny in young people's movies and videos is less damaging than polished acting would be.",
            "The performances and score take it to another level, and as absurd as he is, Morris Day is, in a way, the glue holding this thing together...",
            "The live performances are dope...even The Time! However, the treatment of women was a bit abysmal, though at the time it was acceptable...the movie itself is entertaining.",
            "At once atrocious and awesome, featuring musical performances so sublime you instantly forgive that the rest is so ridiculous. ",
            "The film is a love letter to collaboration, to passion, and to the power of music: this is Prince's legacy, brought to life nowhere more memorably than in Purple Rain.",
            "As a debut and a savvy statement of personal enterprise, Purple Rain is quite an accomplishment. As a film, moreover, it is precisely the sort of vehicle one would have wished for Elvis in his Hollywood heyday.",
            "The drama is clunky, the acting is awful more often than not, and the casual sexism simmers throughout. But whenever Prince takes the stage to perform one of his sizzling songs, the picture irresistibly exudes sex, sweat and swagger in equal measure.",
            "Prince's rock musical-drama has lots of sex, profanity.",
            "A viewer's response to the movie will probably relate directly to how much the viewer likes Prince to begin with.",
            "The music is lively, loud, often powerful, sometimes raunchy, yet full of unexpected subtleties and nuances. The staging is frenetic but as perfect as the machines of the art can produce. This is first class music video.",
            "The less said about the lead performances the better, although Morris Day eclipses the star with a charismatic turn, but Prince and the Revolution were at the height of their powers.",
            "For Prince fans, this movie will be a must for videocassette purchase, but even they will have to deal with the sexist way women are treated by all the film's male characters.",
            "Simplistic, superficial and surprisingly sentimental, Purple Rain is everything Prince's music is not.",
            "worth a rental for the curious and is a keeper for his fans",
            "Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to get through this thing called Purple Rain--the Citizen Kane of Minnesota movies and a worldwide showcase for the ascendance of its then-26-year-old star into rock 'n' roll eternity.",
            "It's probably best to think of the film as an extended music video, a watershed moment for movie sound tracks, and not much more."

            "What starts as an absorbing study of historical characters and situations ends as just another elaborate and over-long Hollywood style costume-piece.",
            "The skill of Amadeus is in making you sympathize with Salieri, as slimy and despicable as he is, because of his flaws. He appeals to your sense of democracy, even though you know that talent -- certainly genius -- isn't parceled out democratically.",

            "Amadeus is a movie masterpiece: engaging, beautifully performed and staged, and packed with emotional power.",
            "Both Shaffer and Forman sidestep traps of being too obvious or of oversimplifying. Consequently, both Mozart and Salieri emerge as complex figures, full of contrasting impulses.",

            "The look of the film is absolutely gorgeous.",
            "Except for the Mozart music and Tharp movements around the edges, Amadeus plays like a monument to mediocrity.",

            "The Natural is an impeccably made, but quite strange, fable about success and failure in America.",
            "I've just about had it with directors who use the mythic mode as an alibi for unshaded characterizations, simpleminded plotting, and swells of artificial emotionality.",
            "Let yourself go and be rewarded by the sight of a hero running home to victory through clouds of fire.",
            "The message is: Baseball is purely and simply a matter of divine intervention. At about the 130-minute mark, I got the idea that God's only begotten son was playing right field for the New York team.",
            "The lead's unwavering integrity is the movie's heart: The Natural does not glamorize vice but triumphs over it with a wholesome finale.",
            "The Natural is a mythic and mesmerizing movie about America's national pastime and the heroism of a lonely individualist.",
            "Some of the subject matter can be grim and mature in nature, but the PG rating ensures Levinson has delivered a contemplative fairy tale for the whole family to enjoy and learn from.",
            "The script is one shockingly drab line after another, and nothing in the expensive 1930s period design can cover up the shabbiness of the moviemaking.",
            "Robert Redford is at his best as middle-aged rookie Roy Hobbs. But Wilford Brimley all but steals the show as crusty but laconic skipper Pop Fisher.",
            "The allure of second chances speaks to anyone's hope for redemption, in any stage of their life. In The Natural, Roy Hobbs's second chance ... is realized at a stage when the character is inching toward the point of no return. ",
            "It's all very corny and much of it's almost alarmingly overbaked... Yet it works.",
            "The scouting report on The Natural has to read: lots of tools but no heart.",
            "If you can suspend disbelief and let yourself be drawn into the movie, you'll be rewarded with an emotional and heart-warming experience that will have you cheering.",
            "Barry Levinson deviates considerably from the wry, ironic tone of Malamud's novel, and if the film is mildly enjoyable it's due to the acting of the supporting cast and polished production values.",
            "An otherwise fine sports fantasy is dragged down by an overindulgence in sentimentality.",

            "Robert Redford isn't playing a 1930s baseball hero ... he's playing an instrument of God.",
            "Somewhat overly sentimental, lacking the novel's subtlety, and less interesting when the action leaves the ball park, Barry Levinson's beautifully shot film is nonetheless a charming fairy tale.",

            "Repo Man has the type of unerring energy that leaves audiences breathless and entertained.",

            "There are endless things to enjoy, from Robby M\u00fcller's crisp camerawork to a superb set of performances, from witty movie parodies to a tremendous punk soundtrack.",
            "Repo Man comes out of left field, has no big stars, didn't cost much, takes chances, dares to be unconventional, is funny, and works. There is a lesson here.",
            "It's very entertaining, and though it's rude in an R-rated way, it has the good taste never to promise more than it can deliver.",
            "Punk rock sentiments amiably collide with science fiction scenario in this instant cult classic produced by former Monkee Mike Nesmith.",
            "One of the finest and most enduring cult films out there. I mean, how can you go wrong...",
            "A great teardown of an atomised society full of alienated people, turned up to caricatured levels by Cox and his fantastically committed cast.",
            "a western [but] also a punk road movie, a conspiratorial cold-war chase caper, a paranoid apocalypse sci-fi, a postmodern mixed \"plate of shrimp\", a hilarious Eighties satire and a wry lowlife rejoinder to Reagan's upwardly mobile American dream.",
            "It's a one of a kind anomaly with Emilio Estevez at his best.",
            "It's kind of a road movie and kind of a science fiction movie and kind of a look at those unsung heroes who repossess cars amid the haze of serious drug use. ",
            "It was 1984 and Americans were on course to re-elect a s****y, sadistic, semi-sentient president. In a f****** landslide.",
            "A playful mood informs Repo Man, yet Cox also takes time to comment on the seamy side of LA, the crushing realities of living in a comformist society, and the problems inherent in a decade that so baldly worships Reagan, L. Ron Hubbard and TV evangelists.",
            "A 1984 underground touchstone [that's] a creepy visitation from a fracturing society.",
            "Half-shaggy, half-annihilating vision of a junk culture",
            "Defiant, antisocial 'tude in '80s punk sci-fi satire.",
            "Fine, stylish debut from Alex Cox with some great turns from the two leads.",

            "Wickedly funny, ceaselessly inventive, and never boring.",
            "The punk/sci-fi film to beat.",
            "A sci-fi thriller takes a wacky look at a particular LA subculture and a zany farce with lunatic characters, including a TV evangelist who preaches against \"Godless Communism\" abroad and liberal humanism at home.",

            "Pure weirdo fun.",

            "The movie is too conventional and fictionalized to qualify as a genuine political epic, but it's emotionally touching in describing the friendship between the NY Times reporter and his Cambodian translator.",

            "First time feature director Roland Joffe shoots the drama with an unforced realism lent a terrible grace by the handsome images and smooth, unobtrusive long takes...",

            "A deeply moving film.",
            "A mighty accomplishment, and possibly the bravest Britflick yet made.",

            "It isn't pleasant to watch a talented filmmaker like John Carpenter willfully distort his personality to fit a commercial (read Spielbergian) profile, and only the opening suspense-horror sequences have the weight of real involvement.",
            "The best special effects are in the first five minutes. Thereafter, it's all rather predictable.",
            "Starman contains the potential to be a very silly movie, but the two actors have so much sympathy for their characters that the movie, advertised as space fiction, turns into one of 1984's more touching love stories.",
            "In Mr. Bridges' hands [his role] becomes the occasion for a sweetly affecting characterization -- a fine showcase for the actor's blend of grace, precision and seemingly offhanded charm.",

            "...works because of the way Allen gazes at Bridges, as if his mystery is her answer.",
            "In switching up his stylistic tendencies Carpenter is able to bring more elements of his cinematic brilliance to the forefront than might be noticed in his more sensationalist films.",
            "He may be the Master Of Horror, but credit should be given where it is due and Carpenter proves with Starman that he's an actor's director (and a big old softie).",
            "Offers little that's fresh but skates by on the strength of the lovely turns by Allen and especially Bridges.",
            "Starman truly is one of the best genre films of the 1980s, as well as one of Carpenter's best efforts.",
            "[A] surprisingly tender, funny movie from John Carpenter, a man otherwise known for his intense horror/genre flicks. It may be the best sci-fi/romance hybrid ever made. ",
            " We see a sweet side to the director that never appeared anywhere else: an emotional palate that he rarely indulged in, but which he handles with surprising grace and subtlety.",
            "Jeff Bridges as appealing alien; best for teens.",
            "Bridges' portrayal of Starman can be as hard to take as the lapses in logic.",
            "An enjoyable film filled with the kind of sensitivity, love, and humor seldom seen on today's screens.",
            "Early Jeff Bridges starrer is fun sci-fi."

            "The film is very much 'a full theatrical meal,' and one that conveys a lot of 'the multiplicity of life' one seldom sees on the screen these days.",
            "By the foreseeable conclusion, it's too late to save the project from its place amongst well-intentioned, immensely mediocre moviemaking.",
            "It is a disappointing signpost to what lies ahead. Lean swiftly turns the narrative into a melodrama of social and sexual unease.",
            "Like the novel, Lean's meditative, graceful film laments and marvels at the mysteries of human behavior.",
            "Certainly it is important to have films which document historical oppression. But this can - and should - be accomplished in a way that does not pit one oppressed group against another.",
            "The spirit of the book has vanished and its strange music cannot be heard. The movie is lovely but earthbound.",
            "Regardless of what one thinks of David Lean and his old fashioned style, the results here - save perhaps for the casting of Alec Guinness as a Hindu professor - are exquisite.",
            "Lean's visually appealing film frequently connects as a social satire and a mystical melodrama of transgressors looking for footholds in psychically threatening territory.",
            "Lean isn't on his A-game here, but the film isn't bad.",
            "Lean's swan song is an intelligent adaptation of Forster's complex novel about racil prejudice and sexual repression, flaunting wonderful perfromances from the two leads, Judy Davis and particularly Dame Peggy Ashcroft.",
            "Epic, briliantly photographed, but slow David Lean drama.",
            "Lean does an excellent job of conveying the repressive nature of British society captured in the novel.",
            "The film, for all Lean's innate elegance, is strangely remote and unmoving. It could easily have been a Merchant-Ivory film.",
            "While the storytelling is rather toothless, A Passage to India is certainly well worth watching for fans of the director's epic style.",
            "Maybe a little too stately, but still a powerful and beautiful film."

            "Writer-Director Wilder has fashioned an ironic, worldly, yet sternly moral comedy that gives an energizing twist to every farcical convention and finds the perfect timing for every rubber-faced reaction to calamity.",
            "The project as a whole is a lot less mawkish than we've come to expect from Wilder's directorial efforts. Still, it ain't exactly state of the art.",
            "The laughs roll along readily as Wilder tries one idea after another to sneak out on wife Judith Ivey and family to rendevous with Le Brock.",
            "[A] broad, unfunny Hollywood remake of the broad, only vaguely funny French original Pardon Mon Affaire.",
            "Fortunately, most of the film is more appealing than its premise.",
            "Wilder is at his frantic best, ably supported by the likes of real-life wife Gilda Radner and Midnight Run's Charles Grodin.",
            "The film drones on through all the clich\u00e9s of infidelity to a resolution that isn't emotionally, morally or comedically satisfying.",
            "The so-called farce is just degrading prattle that drags on much longer than it should.",
            "There are moments of real humor and real emotion in this otherwise frivolous sex comedy.",
            "An amusing comedy about male lust and infatuation. As usual, Wilder is perfect as the nervous everyman.",
            "Nothing fresh or funny to add to the overworked theme of the male mid-life crisis.",
            "When Wilder is on form he can be an irresistible comic draw, but this apologetic male fantasy piece is terribly heavy handed and corny."

            "The havoc makes for a genuine steel metal trap of a movie that may very well be the best picture of its kind since The Road Warrior.",
            "Getting the extraordinary physical specimen of Arnold Schwarzenegger for the lead was a stroke of genius and a stroke of fortune. Each of his pecs is the size of a bull's flank.",
            "Damn close to perfect.",
            "Never has a role been so perfectly sculpted for the Austrian bodybuilder, who possesses a powerful screen presence with little more than his menacing silhouette.",
            "Though the production design is a bit flimsy at times, both the big ideas at work and director James Cameron's brilliance as a proactive, inventive filmmaker generate a powerful flow that cannot help but sweep viewers totally away. ",
            "Sarah Connor's origin feels real and grounded in a way that most (super)hero stories never manage. She doesn't have wealth or fame. She doesn't get dosed with super juice.",
            "A fantastic blend of horror, action, and sci-fi.",
            "Normally, Schwarzenegger's wooden on-screen presence is laughably bad, but his limited range works perfectly in this role.",
            "Those nightmares we've all had about being chased by some relentless, unstoppable monster? This is the movie adaptation.",
            "Much of Terminator's greatness is due to its low-budget aesthetic and lo-fi energy; perhaps out of necessity, Cameron's sense of storytelling has a lean efficiency that both he and the series have long since abandoned.",
            "Cameron maintains the heedless, non sequitur pace of a nightmare without resorting to cheap tactics. The frights of these nightmares, those cracked reflections of reality, hardly feel manufactured or inauthentic. And neither does \"The Terminator.\" ",
            "Wittily written with a nice eye for sharp detail, it's hard sci-fi action all the way.",
            "A nerve-bludgeoning, relentlessly exciting action movie masterpiece.",
            "[Cameron] keeps things under control nicely, though, right through the final confrontation.",
            "Still a toss-up between The Terminator and Aliens as to which James Cameron picture ranks as his best, this propulsively exciting yarn about a murderous cyborg has long staked its claim as a classic -- science fiction or otherwise -- for the ages.",
            "Still one of the most harrowing science fiction films in James Cameron's repertoire...",
            "Remains a surprisingly meditative work, its concentrated visceral bursts not unlike punctuation marks among something more brooding, even prayerful.",
            "Throughout his extraordinary, legend in his own time career, James Cameron has done very little that cannot be legitimately considered well ahead of its time.",
            "I remain perpetually amazed by how magnificently Cameron keeps the tension up... there is not a single moment that isn't operating at 100%.",
            "A cyberpunk picture that flirts with emotional resonance but mostly focuses on the gut...testosterone-fueled, estrogen-boosted action melodrama."
