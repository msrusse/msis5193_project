            "Watching Die Hard 3 is like moving along a conveyor belt with shocks applied to your brain every 10 minutes. It wore me out -- and this from a critic who actually put Die Hard 2 on his \"10 Best\" list five years ago.",
            "Some movies ought to be reviewed not by critics but by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.",
            "[The filmmakers] overcook the Die Hard concept until they lose the juice of their own recipe.",
            "A ludicrous, impossible story, another whiplashing ride through the world of amazing stunts and special effects, directed by action specialist John McTiernan.",
            "Fast-paced, regularly thrilling, and with a greater serving of wisecracks.",
            "Irons is fabulous...",
            "Maybe not movie bliss, as the original, unexpected \"Die Hard\" was, but semi-bliss, for sure. By all means go (as if I needed to tell you).",
            "A marked come-down from the excellence of Die Hards 1 and 2, but still an effective instalment for the franchise.",
            "It's bigger, bolder, darker, but still retains the same sense of desperation, humor, and intensity of the first movie.",

            "While it isn't as insultingly dopey as the first two films in this series, this Die Hard is every bit as violent, obscene and implausible.",
            "Returning to the fray after missing the first sequel, John McTiernan directs with a gleeful disregard for narrative logic, especially in the closing stages. It's cracking entertainment, though.",

            "\"Clockers\" is as grim as it is good. This is not an\"entertaining\" popcorn- type movie. It's timely. It's tragic in many ways. And it leaves a provocative and lasting impression.",
            "Clockers may be Lee's strongest film since Do the Right Thing, but he runs into trouble at the end when he tries to tie up all his threads in neat bows...the passion of this raw, mournful urban epic remains in spite of the false moves.",
            "Lee has jettisoned most of his trademark technical razzmatazz; it's as if he were trying to burn straight through to the heart of his material.",
            "There is a force and focus in Lee's work, an absence of intellectual posturing and a willingness to let his material speak for itself that he has not achieved before.",
            "''Clockers'' remains a major work by a major film artist, but its cinematic achievements are diminished by its narrative and psychological shortcomings.",
            "Strong performances, edgy dialogue and Lee's success in luring an audience into his own tempo and urgent perspective make Clockers tough stuff, indeed.",
            "This harrowing portrait of a young, ulcer- ridden, low-level drug dealer, or \"clocker,\" adds up to the director's best film since \"Do the Right Thing.\"",
            "What all but sinks Clockers is its muddled script, an indulgent mess that is by turns dull and disorienting.",
            "Lee and Price make sure the piece sufficiently addresses such issues as the devastating effect that criminals have on their own communities and the roles that both cops and crooks can play in tandem with each other.",
            "There's no denying the movie's greatness: the depth of the characters, the urgency of its narrative, the nightmarishness of its vision.",
            "Clockers leaves you with a sense of aching sadness, a regretful melancholy for the lives that have been blasted and the wrong decisions that have been made. Once again, Spike Lee has done the right thing.",
            "Spike Lee brings way too much baggage for the movie to work. ",
            "Lee's film never recaptures the impact of the opening credit sequence, a grimly deglamorized tableaux of real-life crime scenes.",
            "Average Lee, but still enjoyable overall.",
            "Arguably Lee's best film since Do The Right Thing.",
            "The performances are strong, but the spectator often feels adrift in an overly busy intrigue.",
            "A study of the urban dope-dealing culture and its toll on everyone who comes in contact with it, the picture has an insider's feel that is constantly undercut by the filmmaker's impulse to editorialize.",
            "Spike Lee gets a good perfromance from newcomer Phifer as the young crack dealer, but the movie is diffuse, paying too much attention to the urban environment and not enough to the personas and dilemmas of the central characters.",
            "Clockers is messy and didactic, but it's complex in a way that a tidy film can't be.",
            "The result is a more sober, mournful and meditative expressionism than you'd expect. That's not to say the film isn't suspenseful, but the director's distaste for the inner city's gun culture is clear to see. Superbly acted."

            "In its candid and bold approach, Larry Clarke's controversial film dwarfs all of Hollywood's youth movies, crossing new boundaries in its portrayal of sex and drugs; for a change, real teenagers, not actors in their 20s, play the roles.",

            "Inspired by Godard's lyrical film-essays, Linklater revisits his unreleased debut (also set on a train), while paying tribute to Rohmer's cerebral moral fables. Though narrower in scope, this film is more mature and generous than previous efforts.",

            "Ambition is something to respect in an artist, but Charles Burnett's police-corruption drama The Glass Shield is such a maladroit piece of filmmaking that its weighty themes and sclerotic tangle of a plot end up making it a trial to sit through.",
            "A powerful moral drama that tries to deal with the racism at the root of many problems in contempo American society.",
            "The movie feels sketchy, as if Burnett chopped the flesh off his screenplay and left us only the bare bones.",
            "It's a rigorous, angry piece of work, but it misses out on the psychological depths that have made Burnett's previous films among the glories of recent American independent moviemaking.",
            "An implausible, wearisome clunker trying to ring true but making only dull thuds.",
            "It has both ideas and a point of view. But the ideas are far from new, and the point of view is blatantly knee-jerk.",
            "While it carries an unavoidable social charge, the movie never feels dogmatic or moralistic.",
            "An angry anti-cop message flick directed and written to be subversive by angry LA based indie filmmaker Charles Burnett.",
            "Despite studio interference, it's still a decent film, and the association of a black man and a Jewish woman (as two outcasts) is a welcome addition to the genre. ",
            "Burnett uses a socially discomforting scenario that has only vague implications of deeper malice to initiate a brave portrayal of a Caucasian-centric sort of martial law.",
            "The film's ambition makes Burnett's occasional overstatement easy to forgive.",
            "Credit writer/director Burnett for having the courage of his convictions, even if the outcome is a film that a lot of people will see as clich\u00e9d and stereotyped.",
            "an entirely honorable - if inevitably doomed - attempt to reconcile Burnett's political and social concerns with the requisites of mass entertainment.",
            "Generic racial drama, hindered by a clubfooted direction and lumbering performances.",
            "A surprisingly compelling look at racism amongst police officers.",
            "Definitely not the work of a genius",
            "Though The Glass Shield gets bogged down in some of its narrative byways, the journey, nonetheless, is rich and rewarding.",
            "Though no masterpiece, the film is an interesting sidebar for moviegoers who try to keep up; it's like a '50s film noir oddity you catch on 3 a.m. TV, only to find that it's become a more scintillating view than Ben-Hur.",
            "Boatman has the open-faced earnestness of someone who believes in his own goodness. As he begins to register the burden of unpleasant knowledge, we see J.J. grow up in front of our eyes.",
            "Burnett's screenplay has a tendency to be a little too preachy, especially during the unsatisfying final scene. There's a fine line between getting the message across through subtlety and becoming didactic..."

            "The Bridges of Madison County is as good as it is because of its performances. It's as bad as it is because of its source.",
            "Still one of Hollywood's most assured directors, Clint Eastwood transcends the story's cliches with a classically restrained yet steadily imaginative filmmaking style.",
            "Streep and Eastwood's chemistry makes the film.",
            "Bridges is an old-fashioned \"women's film\" that pits the heroine's romantic urges against her matriarchal duties. In fact, the film is at its dramatic best when Francesca is finally obliged, like Sophie, to make her choice.",
            "Streep makes her character known in no time flat. Intelligence, humor, blocked ambition, self-irony -- they're all contained in Francesca's quick response when Robert asks if she has any plans for the afternoon.",
            "Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood, as Waller's tenderly plaintive heartland lovers, are so visually and spiritually right they seem to have walked right off the page.",
            "The film is good enough; Streep is the X-factor that makes it excellent.",
            "What follows is, essentially, gothic-romantic bunk. But there's a nicely stylized, below-the-surface courtship between the performers. They make you forget that, at their very core, they are hackneyed creations.",
            "Madison County is Eastwood's gift to women: to Francesca, to all the girls he's loved before -- and to Streep, who alchemizes literary mawkishness into intelligent movie passion.",
            "Little happens here apart from a long, slow buildup to sentimentalized coitus, but there's no denying the sheer screen presence of these two 500-lb. gorillas of pop culture.",
            "An unlikely choice as director and producer, it's thanks to Eastwood's relatively thin sentimental streak that the film doesn't fall headlong into a lagoon of schmaltz."

            "Mira Nair's consistent exploration of the search for home is admirable, but her movie is burdened by an unconvincing ensemble that's unable to elevate the serio-comic exploration of Cuban immigrants into a poignant tale.",
            "The movie sometimes bends the plausible to set up a laugh, and most of the time I didn't care, because I was enjoying the company of the characters.",

            "speculative fiction at its best in that it doesn't just trifle with science fiction concepts, but rather tells a grander story with characters and world disasters",

            "The novelty of this Australian working class comedy of manners is that sexual orientation is not a probelm. Father and gay son (nicely played by Russell Crowe) enjoy the kind of warm, amiable relationship thast's unheard of and unseen in American films",
            "A second look reveals everything wrong with the movie, but on first pass, it's well-performed and enjoyably crafted.",

            "In this triptych of inhumanity, Manchevski answers that, finally, man's humanity is as immutable as his violence. And that, finally, love is a given that keeps on giving.",
            "We'll have to wait for Manchevski's next feature to know whether he's an artist or a shrewd entertainer. In the meantime, Before the Rain is one of the more worthy efforts of the season.",
            "It shakes you up the way many other notable foreign-language film debuts once did -- films like\"Breathless, The 400 Blows or Knife in the Water.",
            "[This] eerily beautiful film constantly reminds us that there is an irresistible fascination, an absurd and terrible beauty, in the violence of our times.",
            "Striking and ambitious.",
            "Even if [Manchevski] ends up making American action films, I hope he doesn't lose his eye for beautiful still compositions.",
            "Brilliantly filmed by writer-director Milcho Manchevski in the rugged hills of Macedonia and the gray streets of London, this three-part tale proves a revelation, spellbindingly told and disturbingly contemporary.",
            "This is a formidable debut for Manchevski, who wrote the film as well as directed it... If all his films are as noble, beautiful and humane as his first, the American cinema will have a new master.",
            "The cast of international players is excellent, with Serbedzija delivering an especially fine performance as Aleksandar, a humanistic photographer.",
            "It has an unnerving feel, angrily observing the way meaningless violence can suddenly blossom and suck in innocents.",
            "Most of the characters are two-dimensional embodiments of commonplace attitudes, and few of the narrative developments gather much momentum.",
            "Manchevski's storytelling abilities do not yet have the self-assured sweep and coherence of his visuals, but Before the Rain is nonetheless a poetic statement.",
            "An important new director announces his arrival.",
            "Manchevski leaves us with too many unanswered questions, most of them involving the very time and space that these characters seem to inhabit all at the very same time.",
            "Director Milcho Manchevski brings an imposing portentousness to this portmanteau picture, but too often he mistakes ponderousness for gravity.",
            "It's a complex, often depressing film, but the stories are knitted together seamlessly, and Manchevski paints a grim picture of how war ruins the lives of ordinary people more than anybody's.",
            "Macedonian writer-director Milcho Manchevski uses the geometry of circles to build this harrowing, poetic drama about the incomprehensibility-and timelessness-of hatred, violence, and war.",
            "Before the Rain is a visually and narratively stunning tale in three parts, set between modern London and the timeless hills of Macedonia, in former Yugoslavia",
            "What it loses in novelty and subtlety it makes up for in its earnest depiction of love and individual human decency in the face of societal cruelty.",
            "Creates a scenario that it's inevitable the heavy rains will fall over the bloody land ... .",
            "Flawed, certainly, and a little infatuated with its own tragic aura, but a brave, compelling work which repays serious attention.",
            "Dealing with the Balkan wars, this ambitious and compassionate art film interweaves three stories (one set in London) that contrast the calm beauty of the Macedonian landscape with the harowing violence that erups within its borders.",
            "Unfortunately not the masterpiece I hoped for, but still a thought-provoking trio of intertwined stories set in the war-torn Balkans.",
            "A glossy, mystical, ultimately pessimistic take on the worldwide ripples caused by Balkan genocide."

            "The audaciousness that marked Todd Haynes' earlier work has been supplanted by self-important preachiness.",
            "The ironic handling of decor and characterisation builds an eerie portrait of the blissed-out West Coast bourgeoisie at their most brainwashed.",
            "It may very well be Haynes' most invigorating work precisely because of all the avenues of projection its fascinating obliqueness provides.",
            "Haynes does to us what his film does to Carol, cannily exploiting our willingness to find answers where there are none, to read meaning into associations.",
            "I found Safe's lack of answers both intriguing and frustrating.",
            "Intended to be an exploration of the attitudes and anxiety surrounding the AIDS crisis, Safe still possesses the ability to leave viewers breathless and squirming in their seats.",
            "One of the all-time great films. Screams out with existential terror showcasing how the lack of identity is not only anxiety-inducing but potentially inevitable due to the modern world we live in.",
            "In many ways, 'Safe' predicts both the insular nature of contemporary society, and the (counter-intuitive) disease of conformity that's synonymous with it.",
            " For all its disquiet, Safe is truly about the terror of losing control-or, even more frightening, being made aware of the fact that we never had control to begin with.",
            " Safe is brilliant for the way Haynes, with cinematographer Alex Nepomniaschy and composer Ed Tomney, blankets the mundane in the eerie tone of science fiction and horror.",
            "Moore, evidently under Haynes' instruction, gives a performance composed of near-total inertia. Her pale lifelessness -- meant to be frightening, I suppose -- is merely irritating.",
            "With anti-star boldness, Moore doesn't so much embody the role as disembody it, dissolving before our eyes.",
            "Frequently fascinating, it never builds into anything profound.",
            "Safe is numbingly fascinating, partly due to its carefully composed, antiseptic visual style and its throbbingly threatening soundtrack.",
            "Todd Haynes has always tended towards the clinical, an approach which in this dark and ambiguous allegory proves ever so coolly appropriate.",
            "Beautifully constructed, chilling internal nightmare where every scene plays out like a little mini movie in and of itself. Brilliant.",
            "Like Carol, this gifted filmmaker seems to be trapped inside a shell -- devoting his considerable intelligence mainly to justifying his own sense of paralysis.",
            "Though the film had a miniscule budget, it looks outstanding with its dull, muted colors and godawful lite-rock soundtrack.",
            "Richer in subtext than text, this poignant, much misunderstood deconstructive film, about environmental diseseas, New Age therapy and TV movie of the week, deserves a second look due to meanings and Julianne Moore's terrific performance in a tough role",
            "One of the most mesmerizing and provocative films in recent years."

            "An idiosyncratic film, admired by many for its strong atmosphere, and by this writer for its absurd(ist) casting of a barely recognisable Fonda as Donovan's mad uncle Van Helsing.",
            "It is refreshing to see so much style and life in the old undead tale, and to watch this strong cast with its perfect deadpan attitudes.",
            "What could have been a brilliant short becomes deadly, stretched to feature length.",
            "This idiosyncratic take on the genre is as much concerned with ordinary family dynamics as the absurdity of its characters' demonic existence.",
            "Not without interest, but less satisfying than even an average Hammer horror.",
            "It may not make much sense, but it never looks less than fabulous.",
            "Unfolding as a languid dream puzzle in Downtown Manhattan nether world, Michael Almereyda's blend of serious and frivolous ideas and mysterious and haunting images recalls David Lynch, who served as film's exec producer and also makes cameo appearance",
            "If Nadja is to be considered an interesting failure, there's something to be said for the value and substance of broken treasures.",
            "Too bizarre to be taken seriously and not funny enough to be entertaining.",
            "A lyrical parody of the vampire genre.",
            "Clever and innovative take on vampire mythology in a contemporary tale set in New York City.",
            "[Almereyda's] imagination seems more focused on composing striking shot compositions than in communicating pure and simple human emotions.",
            "Michael Almereyda's insanely brilliant fantasia on the Dracula legend.",
            "Even as Nadja descends deeper into its downward, surrealistic spiral, the movie's always great to watch.",
            "The most compelling point here has to do with Lowensohn: She's sulky and sad, but her precision is also remarkably vibrant against her shades-of-grey backdrop.",
            "[A] genuinely affecting comedy-horror film that updates the Dracula lineage to present-day New York City.",
            "Hip. Cool. New Wave. Chic. These are only some of the adjectives applicable to Michael Almereyda's new take on the vampire legend. Of course, one other term springs to mind, but it isn't nearly as complimentary. Pretentious.",
            "It's the kind of movie that deals with unspeakable subjects while keeping a certain ironic distance, and using dialogue that seems funny, although the characters never seem in on the joke.",
            "The film stumbles with hackneyed plotting, uneven performances and a deadly-dull centerpiece that goes on forever."

            "The numerous, unflinchingly filmed scenes of public and gang rape make this a visceral, if gruelling, experience, especially when juxtaposed with sprawling, beautifully photographed vistas of the Indian deserts and mountain ranges.",
            "An astonishing, overpowering piece of rabble-rousing, consciousness-raising, epic-scale filmmaking.",
            "An excellent examination of caste discrimination, human suffering, and the role of women in India's changing culture.",
            "A fascinating work.",
            "An exciting movie that brings Devi's story to life with passion but without passing judgment.",
            "A controversial film due to its provocative portrait of the legendary Indian female warrior; even its subject later repudiated it.",
            "Lavishly directed as an historical biopic by Shekhar Kapur.",
            "In comparison with most of the Indian cinema that breaks through to the Western mainstream, Bandit Queen stands out for its political attitude and willingness to take on Hollywood sensibilities in its storytelling.",
            "Seema Biswas' lock on our fascination and sympathies is unreleasable, making for a most powerful film from India.",
            "Although the \"Bandit Queen\" is a film loaded with violence and hatred, it is also an affirmation of the durability of the human spirit.",
            "It is one well worth the time of fans of serious drama.",
            "It is representative of a thousand other real-life stories -- albeit not as spectacular as the Devi saga -- which have emerged in the news from India in the past decade.",
            "Seema Biswas is convincing in the role: small, fierce, dark-eyed and indomitable.",
            "At the center of the movie are two fine actresses who make Phoolan's unsettled character seem inevitable.",
            "This film's a relentless right hook.",
            "To watch the film -- directed with eye-opening vigor by Shekhar Kapur -- is to vicariously experience the social horrors of India's patriarchal system.",
            "This powerful but grueling Indian film is not only a tribute to her spirit, but also a searing indictment of a culture corrupted by the caste system and degraded by chauvinism.",
            "Devi is played by Seema Biswas as a fireball of unrelenting, white-hot fury -- a slap in the face to her country and its barbaric, outdated treatment of women.",
            "Seema Biswas, who plays the protagonist, conveys a remarkable range of suffering - bleeding, at its extremes, into a kind of pure, white-hot hate that makes the anger of Thelma and Louise look like playground stuff.",
            "A towering achievement."

            "More like Natural Born Killers than any other film that comes to mind, but it's ultimately sexier, funnier, and much more 'alternative' (in every sense of the word).",

            "The problem for him[Gere], and the film, comes when the non-physical acting begins.",
            "There's swordplay to the hilt, but the story itself never quite gets in Gere.",
            "[I]f you tingle at the sound of metal unsheathing and the sight of flaming arrows whizzing through moonlight, you'll probably be swept away by this shining Knight in amour.",
            "...a handsome, entertaining twist on the King Arthur legend...",
            "A few large-scale battles and lengthy action sequences can't save the film from its exhausting stereotypes and sappy storyline.",
            "Excali-BORE.",
            "A stock bodice-ripper - albeit one in which all bodices survive intact.",
            "While director Jerry Zucker seems to have been intent on dragging the film to the mushy middle, it's still more entertaining than most comparable Middle Ages-set movies.",
            "Goes for a pass as a shallow but occasionally rousing swordfighting flick with a handful of thoughtful scenes...has something those other pictures don't have: Sean Connery as King Arthur.",
            "Director Zucker is unsuccessful in trying to put a fresh angle on the familiar story, and he is not much helped by his romantic leads, Richard Gere and Julia Ormond.",
            "The out-of-place [Richard] Gere doesn't do justice to the fine performance of [Julia] Ormond."

            "The film succeeds brilliantly at organizing great gobs of information into powerful drama.",
            "Hanks is a terrific choice for the lead because he can appear strong and military without slipping over into Sgt. Rock corniness.",
            "...Apollo 13 is a cinematic masterpiece...",
            "[A] compelling look back at the most action-packed American space mission of all time.",

            "James Horner's score is so good.",
            "The special effects are as spectacular as anything in Star Trek, but Howard shows wise restraint in not inflating the drama and tension inherent in the true story.",
            "Partially filmed in genuine weightless conditions, Ron Howard's movie is a technical tour de force.",
            "Apollo 13, one of the most exciting adventure movies of the year, proves that science history can be just as thrilling as science fiction.",
            "This stuff works so well because the production is so convincing.",
            "The genius of Apollo 13 lies in its universal appeal -- everybody loves a story about a lousy flight.",
            "Howard is not above pushing buttons of his own and milking the big moments. But they are indeed big moments, and the manipulation is not intrusive. He has made a can-do movie for our can't-do age.",
            "Tom Hanks perfectly embodies white bread goodness as mission leader Jim Lovell and, while we may all know the ending, it's a tribute to Howard's no-frills, focused direction that the story remains undeniably gripping.",
            "Tense as the best murder mysteries and as kinetic as the most exciting action films, this space adventure is as thrilling as movies get.",
            "What compensates for this predictable plot is the professionalism with which it's told, turning a minor piece of 1970s history into an engaging yarn with equal quantities of special-effects wizardry and human feeling.",
            "The film, despite its raggedness, is stirring. In the end, this failed mission seems like the most impressive achievement of the entire space program: a triumph not of planning but of inspired improvisation.",
            "If there is one subject that makes it okay to feel old-fashioned patriotism and pride in humanity... it is surely the US space program.",
            "This meticulous but ultimately rather pedestrian drama gradually won me over as a minor if watchable example of the \"victory through defeat\" brand of military heroism that John Ford specialized in."

            "As a straight fright film, Species would be wildly laughable for all the wrong reasons. But for moviegoers able to shelve credibility and go with the gory flow, it is a nifty parody of 1950s science-fiction fare.",
            "It's lip-smackingly good, gory horror fare, with a whole series of thrilling sequences topped off by a cliffhanging climax.",
            "It's a lot of fun. It's certainly well directed. We've seen it all before, but I enjoyed it.",
            "I must admit I really enjoyed Species. I like being manipulated by a clever director, even though it isn't the best of its genre.",
            "As cheesy exploitation, Species offers a few cheap thrills for the teen-age boys who are too young to see it but will get in anyway. For the rest of us, its untidy mixture of misogyny and gore seems to represent the DNA of sleaze.",

            "Though the material is thin, the actors do seem to be getting a kick out of playing off each other.",
            "The film's greatest asset is its glorious acting, with special accolades to Brando, who here delivers yet another magnificent \"comeback\" performance. ",
            "It's a joy to see Brando throwing himself into the spirit of the thing, ardently courting his perplexed wife of 30 years, a ravished Dunaway (they share a lovely five-minute bed scene -- in one, uninterrupted take).",
            "Don Juan is a glorious nut-case, played well by Depp, who mixes a faux nobleman's hauteur with an air of gentleness and longing. The film gets off track only when it makes him too self-aware.",
            "Clearly, director-writer Jeremy Leven was too intimidated by the great Brando to insist that he enunciate. Too bad. But then, Leven didn't do his job well either. ",

            "If ever there was a movie that is more enjoyable than it has any right to be on the surface, it's this one.",
            "Although flawed in many respects -- it's not as smooth and silky a movie as it could have been -- Don Juan DeMarco nevertheless evokes a romantic mood that tickles and caresses; in a way, it's a movie version of spring fever. ",
            "The movie certainly has its charming moments, but it's also so desperate to appear charming that the hard work begins to wear you down.",
            "It is hard to think of another actor who could bring off Don Juan De Marco, as Johnny Depp has. With his voice like a caress and eyes that gently preen, he is entirely believable as a consummate seducer, who yet remains sweet and sincere.",
            "The movie itself is never as good as it should be, owing to Leven's lifeless staging. ",
            "It benefits not only from Mr. Brando's peculiar presence, but also from Johnny Depp, who again proves himself a brilliantly intuitive young actor with strong ties to the Brando legacy.",
            "For the film to work, we'd have to be in denial... and it's just not magical enough for that.",
            "What a bizarro trio! ",

            "With a dynamite opening reel that showcases the series renewed vigor, GoldenEye is two hours of well-executed thrills, high-tech mayhem and one-of-a-kind comedy.",

            "Brosnan's right there, born to play the part. Perhaps by design, he captures a bit from each predecessor -- the panache of Sean Connery, the cheeky humor of Roger Moore, the serious grit of Timothy Dalton.",
            "At the most basic, crowd-pleasing level, Goldeneye does the trick.",
            "Giving 007 a sleek bullet of a BMW instead of his trusty old Aston-Martin isn't exactly going to turn the world of Bond upside down. And, as it turns out, neither does the casting of Brosnan.",
            "In GoldenEye, [Brosnan's] performance achieves darker, Conneryesque tones. And the movie's relatively realistic take on Bond -- realistic, that is, by the series' flamboyant standards -- helps to give his work weight.",
            "In trying so hard to distance itself from old Bonds, Goldeneye is also now a relic of the post-Cold War era. ",
            "The tank chase through St. Petersburg is perhaps the greatest action scene in any Bond film to date.",
            "Goldeneye never loses sight what this film is about. The spy game is all about secrets and betrayal and if you are a spy - keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Goldeneye epitomizes that phrase.",
            "The interplay between Alec and Bond, the cast of oddball characters, the great set pieces. GoldenEye enjoyable for its entire runtime.",
            "Some elements of the story are a little silly - though I love Famke Janssen's portrayal of Xenia Onatopp, her psychopathic, nymphomaniac pathology is slightly comical.",
            "GoldenEye, the 17th in the series and first in six years, gives 007 a new lease on life. Pierce Brosnan is no Sean Connery, but he is the best Bond since Connery started it all with Dr. No in 1962.",
            "It's a thoroughly fun film overall, though, and ranks as something of a forgotten gem 25 years later.",
            "With the ideal Bond, a worthy adversary, gorgeous Bond Babes and a director skilled enough to fully maximize their potential, this stands atop the rest as the best Bond film.",
            "It contains four or five humorous, intricately choreographed action sequences that -- while not as riveting as similar episodes in True Lies or Die Hard With a Vengeance -- are enjoyable on that idiot level that even critics possess.",
            "James Bond's latest outing is big, and it's brash -- in short, it's double-oh-fun.",
            "Basically, James, GoldenEye wasn't bad. A bit long and not the sexiest or most thrilling Bond movie. But a Bond movie nonetheless, and far from an embarrassment like Moonraker.",
            "Under the direction of Martin Campbell, GoldenEye is a film that respects its predecessors. No new heights are scaled here, but it's nevertheless a handsome, well-engineered film that gets the job done.",
            "In GoldenEye, one of the very best of the Bond movies, Pierce Brosnan knows he's trying on something mythical.",
            "Entropy, the inexorable running down of an energy system, may have overtaken the Bond saga.",
            "Exuding charm, charisma and managing to convey a darker side to Bond without ever resorting to Timothy Dalton's pouty approach, [Brosnan] became the first actor to give Connery a run for his money.",
            "What we're left with is a kind of monotonous ordeal by muzzle blast that eventually numbs us.",
            "It all feels like a tired walk-through. Brosnan tries, but aside from the accent, he's really not suited to the part.",
            "Despite a promiscuous number of explosions on screen, don't expect many genuinely big bangs out of this one."

            "A fresh, disarmingly bright and at times explosively funny comedy well worth a trip to the mall, even if it eventually runs out of gas.",

            "A surprisingly witty, artistic, and laugh-out-loud affair (though its shrewdest homages are reserved solely for audiences well versed on the celebrated source material).",
            "With a huge impact on popular culture thanks to its fashion, performances, and stand-out soundtrack, Clueless is far smarter and wittier in its commentary on gender and class than its title would have you think. ",

            "There are a number of reasons Clueless has become a \"cult classic\" and still has a large following, one of which is the terrific cast.",
            "Timelessly astute and alive teen comedy.",
            "Has this delightful level of disconnect like a pantomime, and if it wasn't live action it could almost pass for a literal cartoon - it's that flamboyant.",
            "For a while, it's like really cool, with lots of energy and stuff, but then it gets like major repetitious, and you wish it was like over, y'know?",
            "I watched it and not only thought it was hilarious but I felt like my world made a little bit more sense than it had before. One of my all time favorite films",
            "Alicia Silverstone is a Cybill Shepherd who can act. This is a powerful combination. She deserves a slightly less stupid movie, and no doubt she will get many chances to make one.",
            "There may never be another Clueless but writer-director Amy Heckerling gave us a gem for the ages.",
            "The film's unevenness often works in its favour, and the fact that it now seems extremely dated doesn't matter one bit. It may not be perfect, but it's full of heart.",
            "Its goal is humble: to walk the line between bubblegum pop that indulges trends, and a halfhearted critique of shallowness. I don't think this is what feminists mean by \"having it all\"...",
            "offers some of the best humor, entertainment, and social insight the teen comedy genre has to offer",
            "'Clueless' is a sweet, comical, satiric, knowing film, and it's anything but clueless.",
            "A gag-inducing Four Loko misfire.",

            "Clueless is a happy bubble, and Alicia Silverstone comes into her own as a confident young comedienne."

            "A sensational collection of gun battles, face-offs, and car chases embellishes a destructive cat and mouse endeavor.",
            "You can pencil in the rest for yourselves - a bullet in the head here, an explosion there, plenty of shards of broken glass, assorted blood splatters, and the annoyingly predictable climax.",
            "Assassins has a frantic surface spread over a shallow vaguely disconnected center.",
            "A hilariously pretentious attempt at an existential hitman thriller, Assassins pits Sylvester Stallone's morose mumbling against Antonio Banderas' out-of-control mugging.",
            "One of the worst big-budget action movies of its decade.",
            "The plot becomes increasingly silly, and while some pleasure can be had in the improbable set pieces, this is not nearly as much fun as it should be.",
            "The action is stilted and infrequent, reduced to indifferent gun play, car chases and one standout explosion when a gas main ignites.",
            "It's numbingly cold and pointless.",
            "The further into the action we get, the more ludicrous things become.",
            "...a decent 80-minute thriller that somehow manages to chug along for over two hours.",
            "If I had to describe this movie in two words, I'd say \"long\" and \"boring\".",

            "It's about magnitudes of corruptibility and fallibility, how we all fall prey to them and yet, so we hope, press on. Watching as a teenager in 1995, I felt the fear of what could test me. Today, I watch and fear that I've not yet really been tested.",

            "Although the story isn't original, it's powerfully directed by David Fincher, and Morgan Freeman gives another of his superbly understated performances.",
            "The two actors misfire here: Freeman is so low-key he's almost drowsy, and Pitt jumps around like a chihuahua to no effect. It doesn't help that the sound mix is so murky that much of their dialogue sinks into the murk.",

            "Like those overreaching sophomore term papers we can all laugh at now, this disappointing film may free the Hughes brothers to move on to fresher, more inspired work.",
            "It's an overly ambitious effort that strains to work as a coming-of-age drama, a 1960s period piece and a searing comment on the way African American GIs went largely unappreciated for their war efforts.",
            "What emerges is an uneasy blend of didacticism and juiced-up bloodletting (the brothers don't know when to stop with the exploding squibs) that bury the film's message and its good intentions.",

            "Judging by Dead Presidents and his previous film, The Inkwell, the only thing standing between 20-year-old Tate and mainstream stardom is a decent script.",

            "Significant as both history and film art, this gloomy tale has no \"convenient\" villains and refuses to indulge in stereotypes, instead focusing on larger forces, such as racism and political apathy.",
            "Excellent performances, a great soundtrack, and the Hughes' technical virtuosity make it worth a look.",
            "Talent of Hughes brothers deserves viewer's attention even when their results don't meet such high standards.",

            "Three female friends grow up in a small town in Ireland in the mid-50s and attend college in Dublin in this nostalgic soap opera that's vaguely evocative of Peyton Place, though generally less memorable.",
            "Old-fashioned and nostalgic, Pat O'Connor's nicely directed tale of friendship between three Irish girls features a strong central performance from Minnie Driver that promises a bright future in Hollywood pictures.",
            "The fizzing dialogue gets all the little details right, but the plot's nothing new, and the lingering shots of hibernian greenery aim straight for mid-Atlantic bland-out.",
            "Beyond eliciting warm, animated performances from his actors (with a cast that also includes Alan Cumming as a hair-raising suitor of Benny's), Mr. O'Connor gives Circle of Friends an enveloping look and sound.",
            "Driver's tough core of honesty and wit is bewitching. So's the movie.",
            "Young Benny has a nice smile, and she and Jack seem like pleasant people, but in the end (and in the beginning and in the middle) it's hard to get worked up about them.",
            "An enchanting, if denture-rottingly sweet, yarn.",
            "A familiar tale of busty lasses and lusty lads, it's lent extra weight by fine writing and accomplished performances.",
            "Driver, who delivers a piercingly subjective performance, is the linchpin of the film's quiet appeal.",
            "Sweet Irish melodrama, with a hilariously oily performance by Alan Cumming.",
            "It's intelligent and moving and it never resorts to cheap melodrama.",
            "Wry, wise, and wonderful valentine to intimate matters of the heart.",

            "Definitely in the Masterpiece Theatre tradition; it's soft and safe, but extraordinarily easy to take.",
            "Like an old-fashioned theater program, it tells you early on who and what each of its characters is -- and so they prove to be, enjoyably.",
            "Heartwarming and poignant, a love story that glows with intelligence and feeling."

            "An imaginative, entertaining crime mystery with plenty of nerve and vigor.",
            "If the pleasures of The Usual Suspects are the more superficial ones of ingenuity and style, those are abundantly available. The twists and turns of the plot are an awful lot of fun, while the ending is genuinely satisfying and surprising.",
            "In a season of fat blockbusters, a picture as brainy, bitter, and compact as this one comes as a shock and a treat.",
            "It's a nerve-shredding suspense movie about corruption, a bravura actor's show full of deliciously twisted cops and robbers, and a complex riddle packed with unexpected turns.",
            "For many true movie fiends, noir is the key American movie type, and the most fun when it's done right. The Usual Suspects is done right.",
            "I didn't believe this story for a minute, even in movie terms -- though it's less offensive than a piece of junk like Apt Pupil, Singer's subsequent feature.",
            "Features perhaps the most famous of all movie lineups and the most unforgettable series of unpredictable twists.",
            "One of the best heist films ever made. Includes one of the all-time best twists/reveals in film history. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "In all of my heist movies research, and all of the things that I've watched recently, I think The Usual Suspects might be the best heist movie of all time. ",
            "EVERYTHING that takes place during the two hours minus a quarter of footage comes to affirm that in Singer we had found a rough diamond that already polished some facets. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "A film that was compelling enough with its intricate narrative and colorful cast of degenerates, became an entirely different beast with its final sequence, putting the twist in plot-twist more memorably than M. Night Shyamalan could ever dream of.",
            "A movie where the getting-there (and the getting-away-with-it) is everything.",
            "Singer, like Tarantino, is less into mining new film themes than in re-inventing old ones. And the way he does so shows full well that there is still a bit of life in the old mob movie yet.",
            "It stands up brilliantly to repeat viewing, to the extent that you may never fully solve the riddle. But don't let that put you off; it's the ultimate whodunit.",
            "It's a film that demands to be watched again and again -- this is good old-fashioned pulp fiction told in the slickest 1990s style.",
            "Give director Bryan Singer credit for providing a plot that is not resolved by an exchange of gunfire, but don't expect the movie's glib punchline to stay with you for very long.",
            "Metaphysical mumbo-jumbo? Of course -- but the thrill of The Usual Suspects is that, after years of movie demythologising, it re-mythologises the crime movie.",
            "The most attuned devotee of crime mystery will be hard-pressed to guess the outcome of this stylish thriller. It is riddled with machine-gun dialogue and kinky implications at every turn.",
            "The then 27-year-old Bryan Singer eclipsed most other '90s crime movies with this brilliantly slippery, cerebral thriller.",
            "It may ultimately make sense; no one could tell without at least four or five viewings. What is totally commanding, however, is the level of ensemble acting [and] the adroitness of the storytelling.",
            "A little red herring is one thing. But don't smack me in the face with it, all right?",
            "A masterpiece of the modern film noir genre, a terrific performance piece for everyone involved and an absolutely outstanding directorial effort.",
            "While it's fair to call The Usual Suspects a gimmick in search of a movie, one could say something similar of, say, an Agatha Christie mystery. [Blu-ray]",
            "Anything but usual, Singer's movie is pretty damn near untouchable. Next to this, most other crime films feel petty."

            "It's funny, strange and, best of all, graced with strong human compassion. Visually, Muriel's Wedding is a bustling blend of wry humor and acerbic social satire.",
            "This movie only shows true tact and understanding when it comes to flattering the audience; everyone on-screen is strictly up for grabs.",
            "The trouble with the movie is that there's nothing to Muriel but her false dreams: We never quite glimpse the woman they're hiding.",
            "Most of the action is played for broad laughs, and Hogan demonstrates the ability to generate them, even if the humor is base and often cruel, making fun of people's looks and ineptitude.",
            "An engaging, funny and sometimes surprisingly tough romantic comedy.",
            "[A] gleeful, gaudy tribute to one ungainly misfit and her determination.",
            "There's a high enough feelgood factor here to compensate for the detours off the comedy highway.",
            "Another kooky Australian movie this may be, but director Hogan and his cast sustain a strange melancholic undercurrent.",
            "Enjoyable little film that nonetheless already feels overrated.",
            "Soulfully explores a young woman's journey to transformation",
            "One of the finest Australian films of all time. The laughs don't stop.",
            "So overrated. 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' for the nineties.",
            "Ultimately, the comedy here is grounded in self-hatred, hostility, and despair.",
            "It stars the somewhat homely Toni Collette as Muriel, whose whole purpose in life is to get married. How she does that and what happens after that are a couple of the many delightful surprises in this film."
