            "Raiders is an assured, relaxed, impressive work. It's almost impossible to resist. It's no more substantial than cotton candy -- but it's easily the best piece of entertainment Hollywood has produced in 1981.",
            "This bullwhip-cracking action-adventure launched the series starring Harrison Ford.",
            "Raiders of the Lost Ark has more size than substance but nevertheless it's a delightful special big surprise package of a movie that should turn Indiana Jones into a national figure.",
            "There is a charm and vitality to Raiders of the Ark, which Spielberg later admitted was \"the first movie where I actually shot the movie without thinking\".",
            "Archeology has never been so cool.",
            "A rose of a film - a dusty, blood splattered, face melting rose.",
            "Raiders is a cliffhanger in every sense of the word; the action and suspense never let up, aided by a clever script and the exhilarating directorial hand of Spielberg.",
            "Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark isn't just one of the greatest films of the 1980s but one of the all-time classics.",
            "There's not much to do but to sit and wait, laugh and let oneself be carried away by the dizzying array of images that will please all kinds of people. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "If you've only seen the more recent films and find them somewhat wanting, you owe it to yourself to check out the original to see how fresh and original these blockbuster films once felt. ",
            "The script Lawrence Kasdan constructed from Lucas and Philip Kaufman's original treatment built a real structure for those breathless set pieces, and populated it with characters that moved far beyond the cardboard cutouts of the originals.",
            "Raiders of the Lost Ark could be a silent film at times, because Spielberg favors actions over words, telling his story with great camerawork. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "It is intensely watchable, with the relentless accumulation of effects used here for the purposes of eliciting suspense rather than provoking comedy.",
            "Raiders of the Lost Ark is my favorite movie. I don't have to tell you why it's great. You know why it's great. Instead, what follows is a list of very personal moments.",
            "Harrison Ford embodies the persona of Indiana Jones with perfection and paves him as an iconic hero.",
            "This film is a volcano of creative ideas in full eruption -- the modern high action adventure against which all others must now be measured.",
            "Hold on tight, because it starts at full throttle and never lets up.",
            "Yes, it's as entertaining as you have heard. Maybe more so. Raiders of the Lost Ark is, in fact, about as entertaining as a commercial movie can be.",
            "impossibly good",
            "As action adventure goes, it's about the best there is.",
            "Steven Spielberg's rollicking adventure yarn still looks buoyant and dashing after 30 years.",
            "The first and finest Indiana Jones adventure."

            "Amazingly well-produced. The historic locations are jammed with character and detail. This is the only live-action movie I've seen that literally looks like pages out of Heavy Metal magazine.",
            "A cheerfully irreverent lark -- part fairy tale, part science fiction and part comedy.",
            "Time Bandits is rife with visual, physical and thematic exaggerations that stretch the boundaries of cinematic conventions to form a crazed comedic concoction.",
            "Many of the exploits are lightly engaging, but never full of the tension and excitement of more polished adventure films.",
            "For the most part Time Bandits goes its charming, merry way weaving much hilarity as it does, until the movie careens to its twisted, unorthodox ending.",
            "Terry Gilliam has crafted a story so full of illusions that continuously surprise the audience. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "It's a strange and weird and wonderful mix of boy's own adventure, Python-esque humor, and grim irony, all wrapped in tall tales, ancient myths, and historical figures. ",
            "Gilliam opts for an acerbic and often nasty tone that risks offending the very audience at which it purported to be aimed.",
            "Time Bandits is one of Gilliam's more chaotic films, which is really saying something, but his six time-bandits fill the screen with fractious energy. ",
            "As an adventure tale to enjoy with your kids, you could do much worse than Time Bandits - you just can't expect the depth of Gilliam's more adult works. ",
            "Ex-Python Gilliam is one of the great conjurers of cinema, and this film is proof of his ample and unpredictable talent.",
            "This is an enterprising project in free-form cinema; it's just not very entertaining.",
            "Frequent bursts of twisted humour, several flashes of horror and a ton of first-class Brit cameos combine to ensure their movie never ages.",
            "An intoxicating dose of children's entertainment of the rarest and weirdest and most delirious kind. ",
            "Fun fantasy has a bit of bite.",

            "Warren Beatty doesn't manage to take control of his project, taking history through the path of information or melodrama. [Full Review in Spanish]",

            "Filled with rich ideas.",
            "Vittorio Storaro, who won an Oscar for his cinematography, keeps the long film moving at a healthy pace, mixing static shots with subtle camera movement, never showing off or detracting from the story.",
            "an epic love story ... As a teenager I saw it four times in the theater (which I now find pretty astonishing, considering the movie is well more than three hours long -- I had a lot more free time in 1981!)",
            "Viewed today, it's not so effortlessly impressive, but it's still an uncommonly intelligent and quite entertaining film.",
            "One of the most ambitious Hollywood films of the 80s, Reds is trying to do too much (historical epic, political expose, and romance), but the insertion of interviews with contemporaries of John Reed is original and poignant.",
            "It's tragic that more American filmmakers aren't taking risks like this at a time like this.",
            "A left-leaning pretty boy's distended, black book ramblings.",
            "Marred by historical bluff and jarring cutesiness, 'Reds' is nevertheless the sweeping melodramatic stuff of classic moviemaking.",
            "Were it not for the antique clothing and music, you wouldn't know that the dialogue isn't taking place in the 21st century.",
            "Reds is finally just an appealingly conventional epic movie-star romance with radical trimmings, but it contains several sharper elements that suggest the colorful period it seeks to recreate."

            "I suspect Landis hoped to keep moviegoers eerily disarmed with an unpredictable mixture of wacky and terrifying touches. Unfortunately, his own touch... is so slack and uncertain that the movie ends up dramatically shapeless.",
            "Not just gory but actually frightening, not just funny but clever, 'American Werewolf...' has its flaws, but these are outweighed by the film's many, mighty strengths.",
            "But in a \"comedy horror\" picture, the \"horror\" bits aren't supposed to be this scary. He would have been better off dispensing with the comedy altogether.",
            "Scary-funny is an acquired taste. For me, it tends to be a recipe in which you can't taste either of the constituent ingredients. The big man-to-wolf transformation scene is still a marvel.",
            "Some of the special effects are a little creaky now, but the snap of Landis's editing and the razor's-edge balance of horror and comedy are still fresh.",
            "...an entirely erratic yet ultimately satisfying endeavor...",
            "The prosthetics and animatronics of the initial transformation sequence are the unforgettable (and Oscar-winning) highlight of the picture.",
            "While it doesn't bore or anger the public, it is one of those films that's forgotten as soon as it's over. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Aside from the special effects, this film is a fun time at the movies, but not as memorable as other horror classics. ",
            "It feels increasingly like a symbol of traveler abroad alienation-what trying to live in a place that isn't home can feel like: confusing, rageful, even physically debilitating.",
            "John Landis teaches us two things in An American Werewolf in London (1981): turning into a werewolf is a very painful process, and the dead are boring! ",
            "A film that, despite 35 years of evolution in special effects, do not surpass the carnal naturalness of this one. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Landis maintains the delicate balance between horror and humor until the final scene's gratuitous series of car crashes.",
            "Director John Landis here pulls off the difficult trick of revitalising the horror genre while parodying it at the same time.",
            "One of the few horror films that explore the psychological effects of lycanthropy alongside the physical and the fallout...",
            "The best movie ever written by a teenager -- Landis was 19 when he penned the first draft - and a constant comic delight.",
            "The metamorphoses into the werewolf scenes are spectacular and the beast's rampage through Piccadilly Circus is marvellous. Splendid gory fun.",
            "Still scary, violent and very, very funny.",
            "An American Werewolf in London, like a fine wine, just keeps getting more and more vintage.",
            "Undeniably delivers a good share of scares and dark laughs. And for all its lack of discipline, it's a model of directorial clarity when compared with Landis's subsequent work, which inexorably descended into indulgence and foolishness.",
            "Carnivorous lunar activities rarely come any more entertaining than this.",
            "A clever mixture of comedy and horror which succeeds in being both funny and scary, An American Werewolf in London possesses an overriding eagerness to please that prevents it from becoming off-putting."

            "The spectacular battle scenes, the tenderly poignant love story, and the still-amusing work by Hackman make its broad transgressions quite forgivable.",
            "A definitive look at the strange, impossible love triangle of Clark Kent, Lois Lane and Superman&#8230; not perfect, but in the annals of comic-book movies it remains an indispensable touchstone.",
            "Acaba sendo salvo pelo mesmo elemento que contribuiu para o sucesso do original: a din\u00e2mica e a qu\u00edmica entre Christopher Reeve e Margot Kidder.",
            "...as uneven and overlong as the first one.",
            "By its very nature, the resulting film is severely compromised, but still rip-roaring, unpretentious entertainment.",
            "The combination of Richard Donner's superb original casting and visual attack with Lester's wit and his ear for sound proves a pretty formidable alliance."

            "This is lavish and pretty accurate as far as Hollywood lore is concerned, but Dunaway makes Norma Desmond look like Doris Day.",
            "Mara Hobel and Diana Scarwid are wonderful playing Christina the child and the adult... but it's Dunaway, greedily attacking her role, who proves most riveting. In this glossy, gaudy Hollywood kind of movie, she makes her very own kind of truth.",
            "With its hysterical sessions of psychological (and occasionally physical) torment, the movie is so wretchedly written and flatly constructed that it's easy to regard as a misguided horror flick.",
            "Mommie Dearest is a work created out of pain, but by the time it gets to the screen the audience is laughing at its heroine's pathetic -- and potentially violent -- outbursts.",
            "The character is rendered such a grotesque, its moments don't accumulate to an arc or even a readable profile. They just pile up, like cars in a traffic accident, and all we can do is gawk.",

            "Trashy soap opera drama on the private life of screen queen Joan Crawford.",

            "Under Michael Apted's direction, Belushi gives it a good try. But we will have to wait for another role before we can decide whether Belushi can play it straight.",
            "It's very slight and grows less interesting as Belushi's character is tamed, but it's a rare, welcome look a the late, great comedian's romantic side.",
            "Were we pleased or frightened? Pleased, John.",
            "Continental Divide charts a love relationship that is hobbed by work."

            "A well intentioned fantasy with some wonderful special effects, Dragonslayer falls somewhat short on continuously intriguing adventure.",

            "The scenes involving the dragon are first-rate. The beast is one of the meanest, ugliest, most reprehensible creatures I've ever seen in a film, and when it breathes flames it looks like it's really breathing flames.",

            "The action isn't consistent or frequent enough, while the humor and the romance subplot aren't strong enough to make up for the downtime.",
            "If there was one film from the 1970s/80s early heyday of fantasy films that perfectly straddled the divide between kiddie movies and gorefests, it was Dragonslayer.",
            "It is a lively, fun, suspenseful, beautiful medieval romance what Excalibur tried to be, should have been, and wasn't.",
            "A really solid fun fantasy story that I think holds up quite well.",
            "An innocent adventure that's technically slick and lacking in pretense, this film should provide a nice scare for kids, and maybe a few of the grown-ups too.",
            "It doesn't take itself too seriously and benefits from a good cast that includes Ralph Richardson and John Hallam. The effects aren't bad either.",
            "An unknown treasure of a fantasy film and well worth a look for fans of the genre.",
            "This film has smoky atmosphere, medieval sets, and rugged terrain strange enough to suggest far-off mythic lands; moreover, its special effects are positively staggering.",

            "What makes \"Atlantic City\" sweet -- and that's the word for it -- is the gentleness with which Lou handles his last chance at amounting to something, and the wisdom with which Sally handles Lou.",

            "It combines French discipline and nonchalance with an American generosity and high spirits. The dialogue is precise and often witty, qualities it shares with the acting.",

            "This lyrical tale set in Atlantic City in times of change is full of offbeat characters. It is evocatively directed by Louis Malle in his second (and better) American film and well acted by Burt Lancaster and Susan Sarandon as the odd romantic couple.",
            "Intriguing from beginning to end.",
            "If you don't already love Sarandon, this is the feature that would do it. Director and the 2 stars mesh their talents beautifully.",

            "Pleasingly unsentimental.",

            "Hugh Hudson maintains the dramatic game in its psychological, social, and intriguing ambitions. [Full Review in Spanish]",

            "Granted, this is a British film and so you expect a restrained, understated reaction from the runners, but it's this decided lack of fun that makes the movie drag so much.",
            "What fails as drama are the races themselves, shot front-on so that we don't know who's winning until the tape is breasted, but Hugh Hudson's decision to use slow motion and David Watkin's beautiful lighting lend them a proper heroic burnish.",
            "It's an uncomfortable reminder of how the memory can cheat and the Academy Awards can favor nostalgic sentimentalism over strong storytelling.",
            "Although it is extremely well made, I frankly don't understand what the shouting is about. Good, yes; great, no.",
            "Is it possible to run in slow motion and not hear Vangelis? This is the signature of all great films, a classic scene forever imprinted in your imagination."

            "No. 12 in the phenomenally durable James Bond series. For Your Eyes Only is undeniably easy on the eyes. Maybe too easy to prevent the mind from wandering and the lids from drooping.",
            "Roger Moore has crumpled his comic-strip good looks into something approaching world-weariness, and the newfound maturity in his expression is reflected in director John Glen's style, which goes for the measured and elegant over the flashy and excessive.",
            "Moore is merely the best-oiled cog in this perpetual motion machine.",
            "One of the most thoroughly enjoyable of the 12 Bond pix [to date] despite fact that many of the usual ingredients in the successful 007 formula are missing.",
            "For Your Eyes Only is still the most thrilling entry in Roger Moore's tenure. A great song, a charming ally, a creepy henchman, a terrific Bond Girl, and a genuine espionage mission - what's not to love? ",
            "One of the more unspectacular entries in the series.",
            "This is definitely one of Roger Moore's best outings as Bond. Whilst Moore is naturally a charmer, in For Your Eyes Only, he presents Bond with a tougher edge.",
            "The picture can't quite shake off the increasingly silly legacy which had mired the franchise in the Roger Moore era.",
            "Some really good set pieces and some fun new characters round out a good entry into the Bond series, even if it does suffer from a bit of an identity crisis.",
            "This 12th entry in the 007 series provides no real surprises, with the exception perhaps of Roger Moore, who gets the chance to show a little more grit than usual.",
            "After 20 years, though, it's comforting to have 007 still stylishly triumphant and making the theaters safe for entertainment.",
            "This is the one of the better stripped down Bond films. It's not flashy, the villains are grounded and Moore dials his take on 007 down significantly. ",
            "Gone are the big gadgets and huge set pieces. What we get instead are some decent car chases, fist fights, and practical stunts. The result is a pretty satisfying Bond entry.",
            "The grittiest Roger Moore Bond, it's an under-rated, gadget-light and stunt-heavy return to Cold War action.",
            "There are quite a few individual pieces of \"For Your Eyes Only\" that don't quite fit. But to borrow from its Olympic theme, its gymnastic flexibility sure lets it excel in the all-around. ",
            "[Finds] a way to make even Moore's breezy quipping work in a more sober vein. It's serious without sacrificing escapist fun.",
            "Sea and ski with 1981's Bond in an average outing.",
            "It's the only Bond film where M didn't appear.",

            "[The] story could have benefitted from being a bit more restrained.",
            "An insightful rumination on the codependency between idols and their devotees, disguised as a psychological thriller.",

            "Sharma and Faisal borrow ideas from the Hollywood movie Fan and Khan's back catalogue to fashion an absorbing thriller about a twisted lookalike that perhaps unintentionally doubles up as a reflection on the actor's career graph.",

            "Just for these rare moments inspired by Shah Rukh Khan's real life, you should go and watch Fan.",
            "SRK couldn't have found a better vehicle than Fan, both as an actor and as a celebration of the highs and the lows of his own stardom.",
            "Straight away, no-one does freaky with more flair than Shah Rukh Khan.",
            "It's engaging to watch a powerful actor and his seemingly powerless admirer indulge in a twisted battle of wills.",
            "Fan ends up as a disappointment for its unwillingness to explore the complicated, at times unfathomable relationship between an actor and his fans, and for reducing it to an average thriller.",
            "Only trouble, after this terrific three-hander -- all deft elision, switcheroos and nods -- Shah Rukh Khan can never go back to lazily sending himself up again.",
            "Fan is Shah Rukh Khan's best effort since Chak De! India.",
            " It's a total throwback to Shah Rukh Khan's '90s avatars, but he once again shows how good he still is in that genre.",
            "I can guarantee that the next time you see a horde of screaming fans, you'll observe them more keenly. You might even wonder what their stories are.",
            "Fan works for the most part because it has the fabulous SRK act as a 'young' star-struck boy. His energetic performance is worth the price of the ticket -- if not more.",
            "Superb special makeup effects work by Greg Cannom enables Bollywood legend Shah Rukh Khan to play both a screen superstar and his youthful lookalike fan in this enjoyably twisty thriller.",
            "Despite the slapdash plotting, the film - taken from the point of view of the star - gives an uneasy insight into the celebrity's co-dependent relationship with the people who make him, and can destroy him."

            "The film moves with an easy uncoerced swing: moment by moment, scene by scene, we are unsure what to think or where we are going. It is a fascinating, organically grown drama.",
            "An underrated classic.",
            "Exceptional script, direction and performances make this elliptical neo-noir a forgotten classic.",
            "Suffers from a terminal case of creative indecision.",
            "Richly compelling.",
            "...as damning an indictment of American society and post-Vietnam disillusionment as anything produced by New Hollywood...",
            "Cutter's Way is at once an American film of its time and for all ensuing times, an ugly-truth endeavor examining a nation in which the rich and powerful literally get away with murder while the poor and pitiful barely exist at all.",
            "An inspiring film, it is constructed like a thriller; but instead of reaching for thrills, it leaves them in the background and concentrates on the complexities of its characters.",
            "Passer continued his wayward career without ever producing anything quite like Cutter again. It's a one-off, a largely overlooked shining gem. Do yourself a favour.",
            "Cutter and Bone are seriously unlikeable characters, yet Czech \u00e9migr\u00e9 director Ivan Passer and writer Jeffrey Alan Fiskin make us see light in these hearts of darkness.",
            "Like the '70s output of Pakula and Lumet, Ivan Passer's tense thriller stands as a classy monument to the paranoia of post-Watergate America.",
            "The three leads are on outstanding form, while Jack Nitzsche's score shimmers with foreboding.",
            "Paranoid crime thriller.",
            "This anatomy of intimate male camaraderie in the post-Vietnam War era could have been more resonant if the tale didn't include a routine murder mystery, which diffuses the otherwise beautifully acted (particularly Jeff Bridges) and shot saga.",
            "The result is nothing less than a modern masterpiece, and a film ripe for rediscovery.",
            "It's the sort of picture that never wants to concede what it's about. It is, however, enchanted by the sound of its own dialogue, which is vivid without being informative or even amusing on any level.",
            "Cutter's Way feels like a B-movie, but while its problems are readily apparent, a career-best turn from Heard and a typically charismatic performance from Bridges raise it above the crowd."
