            "At this point in animation history, we can expect no less than perfection from Disney, and they deliver.",
            "The Lion King, complete with jaunty songs by Elton John and Tim Rice, is undeniably and fully worthy of its glorious Disney heritage. It is a gorgeous triumph -- one lion in which the studio can take justified pride.",
            "Between traumas, the movie serves up soothingly banal musical numbers (composed by Elton John and Tim Rice) and silly, rambunctious comedy.",
            "It's perhaps the closest Disney has come to creating a consciously mythical entertainment in the style of Star Wars. Yet like that film it keeps its sense of humor and fun.",
            "Even with its flaws, this latest Disney animated feature once again delivers what its audience wants. Too bad flesh and blood films can't be this consistent.",
            "It bears repeating that The Lion King is quite entertaining as children's fare goes these days. But Disney has established a standard so high on animated features that anything less than a classic leaves you feeling that something's missing.",
            "A stunning artistic achievement that helped create serious critical awareness for feature-length animation.",
            "'The Lion King' is arguably up for one of the best films of all time. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "The Lion King isn't just the best film of the Disney Renaissance but the best animated film of all time!",
            "The best of Disney animation. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Scar is I think the best Disney villain that we've ever had.",
            "Simply the pinnacle of Disney animation.",
            "The massive wildebeest stampede and Scar's Third Reich-inspired musical number were already phenomenal 17 years ago without the additional dimension, so what's really the point?",
            "With its remarkable narrative, memorable characters, stunning animation, and brilliant music, The Lion King remains the very pinnacle of Disney's animated achievements.",
            "A majestic achievement.",
            "Disney can take pride in this lion of a movie.",
            "the animation is stunning on the big screen and beautiful to watch",
            "Even the inescapable hype cannot diminish the fact that this is one great film.",
            "This crowd-pleasing cartoon musical from Walt Disney had enormous box-office appeal, and proved so popular that it was adapted as a spectacular stage show.",
            "Simba is a superbly realized character, especially in the first half of the movie when he's still a little cub.",
            "The rest of The Lion King alternates between grand-opera melodrama and low-comedy hi-jinks, superbly blending the two approaches.",
            "Wondrously imaginative, The Lion King is superior family entertainment, charming in every way.",
            "Although it's state of the art, one might say that in terms of its values, it's the best animated film of the 19th century.",
            "What gives this latest Disney cartoon a real excitement is its story, a swift, sometimes brutal tale of dynastic trouble in the animal kingdom."

            "There's a glimmer of interest in the film's ideological contortions, but as a commercial action thriller this is inflated and sluggish.",
            "In a film that opens with the sight of a waving American flag, subtlety may not be foremost on anyone's mind. But Mr. Ford's wary intelligence does wonders for a potentially one-dimensional character.",
            "For what it is, Clear and Present Danger is fun to sit through.",

            "Having figured out how to make a Jack Ryan action thriller with Patriot Games, the same cluster of filmmakers got to do it again... managing to improve virtually across the board.",
            "Ford's second and final appearance as Jack Ryan is a sprawling thriller.",
            "Well crafted if utterly conventional action thriller (third in Tom Clancy's series), whose best asset is Harrison Ford's star turn.",
            "None of it is uplifting or tells us something fresh, but it passes as easy viewing entertainment.",
            "It's a formula film with a typically dubious political message, but the storytelling is livelier and more engaging than previous adaptations of Clancy's turgid techno-thrillers.",

            "Not everything works equally well in this road movie, but writer-director Stephan Elliott keeps things watchable.",
            "I wasn't prepared for the generosity and gorgeousness with which Aussie writer-director Stephan Elliott turn this most unlikely road picture into something arresting -- if a tad sentimental -- in its naive vision of a perfectly tolerant world.",
            "The plot of Priscilla isn't as important as the outlandish, wicked dialogue , the wild costumes and makeup, and the general high spirits of the entire enterprise.",
            "For the 90 minutes when it isn't stumbling, it's flying high on glitter and glam.",
            "The true heart of the movie, though, is Terence Stamp. He may be a little stiff in the show routines but, offstage, he's a revelation, giving a performance of near-perfect restraint and dignity.",

            "The best things in this transsexual comedy-melodrama are Lizzy Gardiner and Tim Chappel's colorful costumes, which deservedly won the Oscar, and Terrence Stamp's performance, snubbed by the Academy.",

            "Both an unalloyed delight and a surprisingly human, moving film.",

            "If the best parts of Disclosure are its sideshows, its biggest drawback is that infernal infatuation the filmmakers have with technology and power.",
            "Douglas, with Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct behind him, knows all about playing male victimization without total loss of amour propre. Moore's ferocity is totally unredeemed, therefore totally riveting.",
            "It soars because of the sizzling chemistry of Douglas and Demi Moore.",
            "Douglas makes for a sympathetic and wily hero.",
            "In this world of Information Highway sophistication and virtual-reality marvels, the pivotal plot points are all rickety coincidences: an overheard conversation, a fortuitous phone call.",
            "...watchable yet far-from-engrossing...",
            "Little more than another Hollywood sizzler, a highly melodramatic and perhaps opportunistic look at a couple of topical themes; that said, it's also a lot of fun.",

            "The 1943 Lassie Come Home, starring then-child actors Roddy McDowall and Elizabeth Taylor as Joe and Cilla, is widely considered the gold standard to which all dog movies should aspire, but Sturridge's remake is a fine film in its own right.",

            "Music scholars have challenged the film's authenticity, but they cannot dispute the magnificent image-making by director Bernard Rose.",
            "It may be a cartoon. Yet, with Beethoven's compositions crashing and storming around him, it's a cartoon that has some dark, harrowing grandeur.",
            "Yes, this is another one of Hollywood's silly symphonies, an unintentionally amusing bit of piffle that allows mortals a privileged glimpse into the private life of a legendary composer.",
            "Moments like these may lift Immortal Beloved high enough for even the most skeptical of purists to forgive it. Moments like these and, of course, all that glorious music.",
            "For all the story's illicit passion, creative reveries, detective-like investigation and twist ending, Immortal Beloved is episodically slow and surprisingly flat.",
            "A turgid affair with a palette that recalls used Ace bandages.",
            "The results are always excessive and sometimes quite aggravating, but they're weirdly appropriate to the subject of the story, an over-the-top artiste who seemed excessive and aggravating to many of his 19th-century cronies.",
            "Despite Oldman's powers, this adds up to a less than immortal musical love story.",
            "Ultimately, Beloved has all the sound and fury of Beethoven's music but none of its emotional resonance.",
            "Puffed up and pompous, but puny, this is a stodgy pudding of a film that moves at a snail's pace and tries unsuccessfully to accommodate wildly different performing styles from actors of various countries.",
            "Immortal Beloved is pure historical hokum. Nevertheless, it is an absorbing motion picture and a heady blend of stellar performances, spectacular backdrops and crafty screenwriting.",
            "Da-da-da-DUMB!",
            "It's an audacious mixture of Citizen Kane and Amadeus, with some Fantasia-like musical sequences added for good measure. Indeed, cinema has rarely given classical music such a chance to weave its spell.",
            "Immortal Beloved is a lot like the famous sketch of Beethoven's study, made shortly after he died, showing a piano strewn with piles of junk and papers. It's a mess, but you know there has to be examples of Beethoven's genius in there somewhere.",
            "There is an image in Immortal Beloved as evocative as any I can remember -- as complete as the sled in Citizen Kane, or the shadowy doorway in The Third Man.",
            "Kitsch, yes, but weirdly transporting. And the score is wonderful.",
            "For all the movie's faults, however, Rose does show now and then that he can create an inspired marriage of image and music.",
            "As biography, Immortal Beloved is trashy and fraudulent, yet as an impressionistic riff on Beethoven's temperament, his spirit, it exerts an irresistible pull.",
            "Occasionaly the hand of Hollywood crassness is reared, but there are moments of shrewd storytelling and some fine performances.",
            "Crucially, [director Rose] fails to drum up much suspense or even interest in the solution to the puzzle, poking a hole in his own balloon even before he fills it with air to try to make it fly.",
            "I doubet whether Rose's speculative and overwroght chronicle of Beethoven will rekindle interest in the composer's life and work in the same way that Amadeus did for Mozart.",
            "The film may plod and pulse in equal measure, but the ecstatic visualisation of the climactic Ode to Joy is a triumph.",
            "A little slow, but overall a good film."

            "The script by writer-director Boaz Yakin is fresh itself, marrying the physical violence of Fresh's world with the intellectual violence of competitive chess.",
            "[Fresh is] made with a subtle precision that suggests a Vermeer landscape of the ninth circle of hell.",
            "This is kept alive largely through its first-rate performances, beginning with Sean Nelson's as the boy; Giancarlo Esposito is also a standout.",

            "A gripping story of survival on the streets and survival of the soul.",
            "It's rigorous and quite depressing fare.",
            "The strength of the piece is that it realises which aspects of its genre have been seen too many times, always coming back to Nelson's blank but expressive stare as he watches terrible things the director doesn't need to shove in our faces.",
            "The absence of moralising and macho posturing gives authenticity and poignancy to the film.",
            "A hugely underrated crime drama, Fresh is worth discovering both for its air of authenticity and Sean Nelson's remarkable performance.",
            "Fresh appeals to the head as well as the heart.",
            "Sean Nelson, who turned 13 just before the film was shot, gives a fine, self-assured performance in the title role.",
            "An unpredictable and harrowing story that works on the surface as an unconventional thriller (an intricate plot) and underneath as a powerful story of love, sacrifice, willpower and the dehumanizing cost of violence and revenge.",
            "You may not believe a minute of it, though you won't forget Nelson's face.",
            "Yakin has put some powerful drama up on the screen, and he has been assisted by no one more significantly than young Nelson, who plays Fresh.",
            "Though its morality may be controversial, the film, an impressive debut from Boaz Yakin, deserves credit for introducing a new type of protagonist, a ghetto teenager willing to do everything and anything to escape his lot.",
            "A stylish, affecting, ingeniously plotted first feature.",
            "Unlike John Singleton's by-the-numbers Boyz n the Hood, Boaz Yakin's Fresh doesn't rely on skeletal portrayals of life in the ghetto, or moralistic messages."

            "Pulp Fiction (1994) brought director Quentin Tarantino, a B-movie fanatic and ex-video store clerk, to mainstream attention with this stylish and inventive episodic thriller about corruption and temptation. It featured guns, femmes fatales, deadly hit-men",

            "Pacey, punchy and at times hilarious. It's quite a movie.",

            "Soon enough you come down off its high, with that druggie feeling of your bones being hollow and your skin encrusted with dirt; but you can't deny that the movie delivers... or that it somehow elevates craft and cleverness to the level of art.",

            "When Martin puts Clifford on a harrowing hyperspeed version of the Larry the Scary Rex ride, the special effects are impressive, but not worth waiting for.",

            "The flaws aren't fatal. The beauty and brilliance that might have been, don't preclude the quality and bravery that exist on the screen.",
            "The House of the Spirits is like Gone With the Wind with the fun and excitement replaced by lofty. All that's left is the wind.",
            "How can an accomplished director take a great novel, the best actors working and the finest technicians available and make a film so... bland? It's a puzzlement.",
            "Inert from its opening moments to its too-long-delayed close, this lackluster production is an example of international filmmaking at its least attractive, and a misstep in the careers of pretty much everyone involved.",
            "Nearly every magic detail, many key characters and half a generation has been sacrificed to clarify the plot. But so much has been cut away that only the skeleton of the story remains.",
            "If The House of the Spirits fails to reinvent its traditional form as The Piano did, it still redresses Hollywood's usual sexual politics -- and provides an exotic wallow.",
            "It's also a wretched paradox: a big budget, star-driven art film whose very elements subvert its ambitions and turn it into the thing it least wants to be -- a listless '50s-style Hollywood melodrama.",
            "This isn't just a bad movie -- it's hugely, grandiosely, pompously bad.",
            "Similar epics are made with more conviction and less pretension on daytime TV.",
            "The film version stresses political intrigue and revolutionary violence at The expense of the anything-goes dreaminess that gives the book its most memorable moments. A stellar cast doesn't help much.",
            "It's always painful when a brilliant book becomes a bust of a movie.",
            "This is really quite an achievement. It brings together Jeremy Irons, Meryl Streep, Winona Ryder, Antonio Banderas, and Vanessa Redgrave and insures that, without exception, they all give their worst performances ever.",
            "The story, from the best-selling novel by Isabel Allende, is purely incidental to the unintentionally hysterical stylings of this potential camp cult film. It's truly awful, and one shouldn't miss it for the world.",
            "Given the talents involved, the film's hesitations in style and consistent failure to really move must be counted as a major disappointment.",
            "August's earnest International Motion Picture Adaptation remains all too tethered to earth, weighted down by a surfeit of good intentions.",
            "Antonio Banderas invigorates this glum gothic family saga as a defiant young Chilean revolutionary. And without her idea for The House of The Spirits, Isabel Allende insists she would not be a writer today. ",
            "Just as the characters' motivations are mostly crude rather than complex, and the view of class politics superficial and romantic rather than acute or intelligent, so is the film's treatment of the novel's magical realism on the mundane side. ",
            "A total misfire, from conception to execution to casting. With the exception of Banderas, all the leads are played by American and British actors.",
            "Irons gives an excruciating performance - what Streep's genuinely warm, wonderful Clara sees in him you'd need ESP to fathom.",
            "Sterling cast, but a thoroughly mundane movie",
            "It does take daring chances with a book that could not have been adapted otherwise, using extraordinary actors to rise above its occasional lapses. The lack of fidelity is often offset by intelligence of a subtler kind."

            "The script is notionally based on the old television series of the same name, but the screenwriter William Goldman, has produced something depressingly up to date in its incoherence, its crisis of confidence served up with a sickly grin.",
            "[Maverick] succeeds, just barely, on the good will of its stars and the sumptuousness of its Western locations.",
            "By the time Donner crowds his climactic poker game with a bevy of veteran Western character actors, decades of movie tradition have been reduced to window dressing, and Maverick leaves you hungry for the real thing.",
            "[Gibson and Garner] can make you smile contentedly even when the script is wandering and they're just sort of standing around waiting for its next good part to develop.",
            "Maverick is smart-alecky without being very smart. It's full of spoofy, har-dee-har-har ribaldries -- this film practically winks at you.",
            "This movie doesn't have the wry kick of the TV show at its best. Too rich, too loaded, Maverick may have misplayed its cards, kept its eyes on the pot instead of the players. In movies, as in poker, you can't always trust a pat hand.",
            "Maverick is quintessential summer fare, an unpretentious no-brainer that relies mostly on the star wattage of Gibson, Foster and old reliable James Garner.",
            "Goldman and director Richard Donner don't know when to stop mining a gag and to move on. That the film runs in excess of two hours is indicative of the filmmakers' love affair with scenes that don't work.",
            "It's cleverly crafted, and you can't help enjoying it even when you know it's manipulating you as brazenly as a poker dealer with tricky fingers and a well-stacked deck.",
            "Somewhere about halfway through Hour Two, you might find yourself looking at your watch and wondering, 'Like, when is this movie going to begin?'",
            "We can close the competition for the most entertaining of the current spate of feature movies based on old TV shows.",
            "Despite the attention of master scriptwriter William Goldman, this gentle tribute to the hit comedy western TV series missed a golden opportunity for a razor-sharp spoof. There's no doubt the stars had a ball, though.",
            "Maverick never takes itself seriously, which establishes the tone for serious fun. Goldman's screenplay is a model of ingenuity, setting increasingly complicated traps for the three leads, and rather amazed that they wriggle free.",
            "Maverick reminds us of what killed the western in the first place.",
            "Facetious and cynical, Mel Gibson's star vehicle is glossy and superficially enteratining, but doesn't begin to approximate the charm of James Garner and the original TV series.",
            "True deft wit is just plum missing from this good-natured, flat-footed, eager-to- please, tee-hee Western.",
            "...an easygoing diversion that could've (and should've) been so much better...",

            "Smith credits Richard Linklater's Slacker as inspiration. But Clerks supplies its own subversively witty take on Generation Next.",

            "\"Clerks\" is unapologetically rough and even ragged at times. But its lack of circumspection turns out to be its charm.",
            "At his best, [Kevin] Smith captures the zeitgeist of an era and becomes the voice of a generation.",
            "If Clerks lacks the grunge artistry of its forebears, it's a fast, likable 90 minutes at the movies. The way our culture is going, this may be what a hip sitcom looks like in 15 years.",
            "With no narrative per se and nothing holding it together except unity of time and place, it's surprising that \"Clerks\" plays as well, and consistently, as it does, with very little down time.",
            "The acting is a bit amateurish at times. But when dialogue like Randall's monologues -- piercing and brutally fresh -- are presented to the audience, all is forgiven.",
            "The two men at the film's core feel three-dimensionally rendered despite our knowing little about them besides a single day's activities. This is a testament to Smith's ability to write skit-like gags in a way that add depth.",
            "This remains Smith's masterpiece, and demands our attention 25 years after its premiere, just as it did when it released.",
            "still such a treat to watch over twenty years later, is through its ingenious snapshot of small-town Americana and the inertia of Generation Xers.",
            "There's no denying the raw and energetic feel Smith created with a memorable script, great characters and a genuine sense of Gen X angst.",
            "an exemplar of what can happen when the stars align and someone's home movie can help foment a revolution",
            "Clerks remains a defining debut, a symbolic shot into the darkened domain of legitimate moviemaking.",
            "Nothing, no matter how outrageous, is beyond Smith, and his willingness to flaunt cinematic taboos is one of the reasons why Clerks is such a unqualified success.",
            "...the film's inherent deficiencies are generally overshadowed by the distinctly earnest vibe.",
            "Smith dogpiles absurdity and obscenity on top of each other. The dullness of the dead-end jobs is brightened by bizarre bits--a fat guy asking for softer toilet paper, drops dead on the toilet.",
            "If it's fancy packaging you want, forget it; if scuzzy talk and laugh-out-loud humour are your bag, check this out. ",
            "Kevin Smith actually pulled it off.",
            "Hilariously funny and very, very rude.",
            "It comes from bad stock, curses like a longshoreman and doesn't bring a gift. Nevertheless, it's the life of the party.",

            "...it is the ability to identify with the characters that makes the story so universal. I mean, we've all known people like these who have annoyed us all our lives."

            "Polanski wisely never opens out the action from the remote clifftop house. In keeping things claustrophobic, close-up and ambivalent, he heightens the suspense (not to mention the sexual tension).",
            "Mr. Polanski treads lightly on the clumsier lines, and sustains tension by creating an elegant, unobtrusive dance with the camera.",
            "Death and the Maiden forces the audience to confront questions about torture and punishment.",
            "Polanski keeps the situation ambiguous to provoke questions of guilt and responsibility.",
            "Polanski manages to size the fundamental components of the mystery and suspense so that the atmosphere of the film is sinister in some scenes. But what I see hardly captivates me. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "It's based on the gripping three-character play by Ariel Dorfman.",
            "Even by their high standards, the performances of Weaver and Kingsley here are impressive, and Polanski ratchetts up the tension nicely. A chilling and thought-provoking piece.",
            "The material is well served by director Roman Polanski, who knows well how to instill a subtle, claustrophobic sense of dread in an audience and has put together a rather elegant potboiler.",
            "Polanski kicks the movie up to a level of emotional violence rare in English-speaking films.",
            "Polanksi's direction is crisp and precise but he doesn't resolve basic problems of the stage-to-screen transfer: The tale is claustrophobic (mostly limited to one set) and schematic, with all three characters serving as ideological mouthpieces.",

            "Rudolph's effort to dramatize the life of the acerbic writer is dissatisfying due to shallow script that offers only a sketchy look, and Jennfer Jason Leigh's stiff rendition further hampered by arch accent; it's all black-and-white style and no drama.",

            "It's often cruel, of course, and cool as an ice-pick, but it's still endowed with enough unsentimental humanity to end with a touching, lyrical admission of the power of love. Essential viewing.",
            "How could the creator of Blue, the story of a woman who grieves by moping around Paris in a chichi haircut, possibly have followed it with such a rich, light-handed marvel?",
            "Kieslowski, who so keenly satirized the crippling excesses of communism in his earlier work, unflinchingly has a go at training-wheels capitalism, but not without affection for the thawing tundra of his beleaguered mother country.",
            "In Kieslowski's world, what goes around comes around, and Karol's journey to self-improvement ... is funny while also being strangely moving.",
            "I suppose the acting and filming of White is fine but the story and characters were too insufferable and annoying for me to care about",

            "Unquestionably well made, and with a clever and very concentric vein of humour and storytelling verve sustained throughout.",
            "This hugely talented director seems to do everything with a shrug -- scratching at subjects rather than excavating them.",
            "[T]his is the comedy of the trilogy, not so much a black comedy as a wicked satire in the cold white light of Polish winter, which (as you would expect) informs the color palette of this film.",

            "The least favourite of the trilogy, this is also arguably the most accessible.",
            "Kieslowski's film is one of the great film comedies. Sure, it's the light relief of the Three Colours trilogy, but its sharp observations about human nature are every bit as telling. ",
            "Karol Karol embodies his homeland, going for broke--in criminal fashion, if necessary--to stake its claim as a player in the European landscape. [Blu-ray]",

            "Cobb is a refreshingly spiky antidote to all the Hollywood paeans to the glory of the game.",
            "Most biopics mistakenly try to take us from cradle to grave and end up skimming the surface. The wisdom of Cobb is that writer-director Ron Shelton knows that the close study of a single day can decode a human life.",
            "Unfortunately, the movie just makes Stump look like a self-important jerk, possibly a bigger jerk than Cobb, and Wuhl's affable, weightless performance doesn't help.",
            "Cobb cuts right through the winner-take-all ethos of American athletics. It's a raw, inspired, audaciously funny, and unexpectedly moving collaboration between the writer-director Ron Shelton and Tommy Lee Jones.",
            "Ty Cobb is such a towering figure in this motion picture that it's easy to overlook Al Stump -- and Robert Wuhl's feisty, witty performance in the thankless role.",
            "[Jones] lets it all loose here. It's the performance of a lifetime: full of menace and venom, eloquence and fire, rot and pathos, crackling rawness and realism.",
            "A curiously gripping amalgam of Patton, Citizen Kane and Melvin and Howard.",
            "To watch Tommy Lee Jones re-create the persona of the Hall of Famer in Cobb is to encounter the greatest SOB ever to come down the pike -- in or out of the domain of sports. The trek is hardly entertaining.",
            "While the story of Cobb himself is a worthy one (Shelton's treatment, believe it or not, even has its similarities to Orson Welles' Citizen Kane), Shelton shortchanges the very game that made the man famous.",
            "Stump is well-played by affable Robert Wuhl, who has the unenviable responsibility of representing the one sane man in Ty's crazy universe.",
            "Cobb's accomplishments on the ball field would make for an absorbing documentary, but it's the passions and pitfalls of his private life that dominate Ron Shelton's melodramatic film.",
            "Ron Shelton, whose Bull Durham and White Men Can't Jump were jokey tales of disillusionment set in the sporting world, here redefines the life of an idol with a certain honest savagery.",
            "The result, whether Cobb is wailing about greatness or ruminating about the dark circumstances around his father's death, is a performance too operatic and out of control.",
            "This is a messy movie, sometimes repetitive, sometimes too compressed and allusive. But that's like saying Ty Cobb was not a very good sport -- irrelevant in comparison to the horrific fascination of his story.",
            "The movie never equals the performance, but still fascinating to watch.",
            "Massively underrated.",
            "Director Shelton is a master at locker room drama, and helped by a towering performance of snarling egomania and drug-fuelled bitterness from Jones, he tackles the dichotomies of [Cobb] with engaging enthusiasm.",
            "It's such a potent and courageous wreck of a movie that it's worth more than most 'successes.'",
            "Tommy Lee Jones is superb in the title role, but writer-director Ron Shelton unwisely chose to structure the film as a two-character piece, thus placing undue attention on the lackluster character of Cobb's biographer, Al Stump.",
            "It's unclear just how much sympathy we are to extend the unrepentant and bullying title character.",
            "Shelton's film is about the nature of truth and popular myth, about the single-minded pursuit of glory, and the horrors within. It's also very funny.",
            "Tommy Lee Jones gives an uncompromisingly volcanic performance as the psychotic bigot, one of baseball greatest players, known for his aggressive conduct, racism, and sexism."

            "A very stylish and sophisticated Mexican variation on some age-old themes.",
            "That sort of horror is a lot more introspective and messier to dissect, but much like other films in Guillermo del Toro's oeuvre, Cronos is all the more existentially horrifying the longer it sits with you.",
            "A really fun atmospheric little horror movie",
            "A haunting little film that would augur greater successes such as Pan's and del Toro's 2001 masterpiece The Devil's Backbone.",
            "Cronos, the crafty debut of a young Mexican filmmaker named Guillermo del Toro, emerged as a warning shot. His tale of vampirism and immortality is half horror, half historical fable-like all the best del Toro work to come.",
            "From the prologue, it becomes clear that del Toro possesses an extraordinary vivid pictorial sense.",
            "\"Not everything is garbage,\" Dieter insists to his thuggish nephew Angel (Perlman)... Del Toro, too, knows that he is working in a genre typically dismissed as trash, but nonetheless, like an alchemist, transmutes it into pure cinematic gold. ",
            "It's part melodrama, part morality play and part thriller, more Dorian Gray than Bram Stoker and infused with a heady alchemic brew of ancient science, supernatural shadows, mutant organisms, demented villains... ",
            "A compelling, complex and wonderfully atmospheric film from Mexican director Guillermo del Toro that is as much about religion and the nature of cinema as it is a horror story.",
            "Stylishly dusted with musty mysticism, Cronos never sinks its teeth to the bone, but despite some grumbling plot-cogs, del Toro's hallmarks -- tragic heart, splatty body horror, prickly insect-fear -- all gestate wickedly.",
            "A charming horror movie, if such a thing is possible.",
            "A low-budget horror/fantasy with some rough edges, Cronos reveals the dark genius of Guillermo del Toro's fecund mind.",
            "Many of the aesthetic qualities and thematic devices that Mexican director Guillermo del Toro would employ in later movies are already on the boil in his debut feature, Cronos.",
            "Del Toro conjures up a delightfully potent atmosphere and motion for it, born no doubt of a real appreciation for such things. ",
            "Guillermo del Toro says, \"Cronos is an exploded view of my brain.\"",
            "The truly child-bound perspectives of The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth are still to come, though Aurora has flights of del Torian wonder.",
            "... a weird, heady alchemic brew of antiquated clockwork mechanism, mutant organisms, demented villains driven by a greed for youth...",
            "A beautifully creepy, hypnotic horror-thriller that paints a vivid picture of why del Toro is such a beloved, wonderfully haunting filmmaker today.",
            "This is a wonderfully baroque, gleeful subversion of the days of Hammer. A unique, terrifying mini-masterpiece."

            "Fifty years from now, Forrest Gump will probably seem hopelessly quaint, cryptic, even ridiculous. Today, however, Gump, the much talked about summer fable starring Tom Hanks, is a tonic for an age of cancerous cynicism.",

            "While individual interviews, pop-video parodies and album titles hit the mark, the film as a whole is insufficiently clear-cut in its satire of the bands' dubious antics and attitudes.",
            "If Mr. Cundieff doesn't match the satirical genius of Mr. Reiner's film, he does understand the rules of the game.",
            "This movie is not tightly-scripted or elegantly produced, but it is (for the most part) highly entertaining. For those who have been waiting for a sequel to Spinal Tap, this may be the best alternative.",
            "Fear of a Black Hat is not brilliant, but it's bright enough.",
            "It lampoons the luminaries, yes, but gives their authentic anger, which came from a real place, the benefit of gentler nudges. Its greatest fury lambastes losers who embraced a gangster rap ethos to build a bank account, not let loose a battle cry.",
            "Borrowing intelligently from This is Spinal Tap, writer-director-actor Rusty Cundieff has crafted a mock music documentary that is as irreverent, hilarious, and tough-minded as its model.",
            "The rap scene has always had its share of colourful characters that are already caricatures. Why is there a need to spoof it?",
            "Satire at its finest. Uproarious and endlessly creative.",
            "It's like \"CB-4\" -- only funnier.",
            "There's no plot to speak of, just gag after gag. Rap fans will likely love most of it; all others, flip a coin.",
            "Not as fearless and sharp-edged as it could be -- but it provides a lot of laughs, and barbecues a few sacred cows.",
            "As it recounts the history of N.W.H., the film also manages to lampoon rap music and its archetypes, as well as poking fun at the venal, self-serving music-business types looking to grab easy money from the scene.",
            "Cundieff is perhaps most adept at skewering rap's self-important politics through Ice Cold's wonderfully improbable explanations of how songs such as 'Booty Juice' actually contain an important social message."

            "Not frightening, just silly.",

            "Sumptuous to look at, with some decent performances...",
            "In attempting to keep faith with the original novel, Branagh concentrates too much on design and content, and loses the heart and soul of the story in the process.",
            "Branagh is very obsessed with chewing the scenery. So much so that he even manages to outdo Robert DeNiro.",
            "Branagh's ambitious take succeeds as a cautionary tale about true monstrosity: hubris and man's inhumanity to man. But one man's operatic style is another man's unintentionally comical excess, and...Frankenstein certainly tempts fate... [Blu-ray]",
            "Clearly, one person's authentic homage is another person's overwrought teeth-gnashing fest, as Branagh's film never hesitates to slop on the melodramatic mustard.",
            "I'm inclined to give it an 8 now. The more you watch, the more you appreciate how Branagh was able to faithfully retell Shelley's novel while still managing to make it fresh and make it relevant.",
            "Uma das mais fi\u00e9is e complexas adapta\u00e7\u00f5es da hist\u00f3ria original, respeitando seus temas principais mesmo que desviando-se, aqui e ali, de pontos espec\u00edficos da trama.",
            "Different look at the old Frankenstein story, directed by Branagh.",

            "For all its attention to detail and special effects, this version lacks the pathos and tragedy in the complex and ambivalent relationship between the father-creator and his creature-monster; De Niro is misguided by director Branagh.",

            "The movie gets a lot of mileage out of a seemingly simple concept.",
            "Yet another quirky independent comedy about a disenfranchised white male urban slacker, Floundering is distinguished mainly by its left-leaning politics and numerous cameos by boho thespians and alternative rockers.",
            "One of those \"chatty slacker\" flicks that actually delivers some interesting characters and worthwhile conversations.",
            "It's an engaging, occasionally hilarious story that occasionally seems as though someone had finally gotten hold of all that twentysomething malaise without intent to exploit.",

            "Alex Proyas's pulp revenge fantasy, based on a comic-book saga by James O'Barr, is dark, moody, and seductively overwrought; it's an amazingly pure expression of morbid adolescent romanticism.",
            "It's a pleasure to welcome The Crow -- a bird of a very different feather.",
            "As exploitation pictures go, I've seen a whole lot worse.",
            "The Crow, starring the late Brandon Lee, is like one long fright night. Even though it was photographed in color, the edge-of-darkness atmosphere descends on the audience like a shroud.",
            "What's scary about The Crow is the story and the style itself: American Gothic, Poe-haunted nightmare, translated to the age of cyberpunk science fiction, revenge movies and outlaw rock 'n' roll, all set in a hideously decaying, crime-ridden urban hell.",
            "If The Crow is forgettable entertainment, it can stand as an eerie epitaph for an actor who looked like he was on the way to better things.",
            "A first-rate revenge fantasy and a thrilling adaptation of the comic book series on which it's based.",
            "From heartbreak, rage, pain, love, and even brief moments of humor, Brandon Lee brings all the pathos to the table.",
            "Proyas created a look and feel to The Crow that was wholly unique.",
            "The Crow is so stylish and so particularly of its time, it's kind of impossible to resist its charms, even when acknowledging how downright ludicrous most of what happens actually is.",
            "The movie is very interesting, it's very funny, and again, it presents two experiences: The movie and the soundtrack alone. These two experiences are good, and when they are put together it is even better. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "Unlike many comic-book heroes, Eric Draven is no wiseguy. Nor does he don a balletic costume of capes, tights, boots, etc. A line in the screenplay by David J. Schow and John Shirley describes him aptly: \"the mime from hell.''",
            "Despite its hardcore demeanor, there's also a surprisingly sensitive streak weaving throughout the film.",
            "Luridly lit, jumpily edited and searingly scored, the film is little more than an extended pop video, the thin plot an excuse for an orgy of destruction and vengeful violence.",
            "This lurid thriller is long on nasty shocks but short on spontaneity, intelligence, and good acting.",
            "The Crow also runs a huge villain deficit.",
            "The movie's central value and its most melancholy tone -- Lee's star presence. It's amazing and it's tragic.",
            "A stylized revenge fantasy of dark beauty.",
            "The Crow is a visually immersive, emotionally wrought comic adaptation and one of the best gothic tales ever made.",
            "Stronger visually than thematically, this romantic film noir is utterly seductive",
            "Style over content, sure, but what style...",
            "[Features] a heartfelt romantic core and some handsome, acrobatic action sequences that do justice to Lee's undoubted martial mastery.",
            "It succeeds in bringing O'Barr's comic-book vision to life, but there's little else going on behind the graphic razzle-dazzle and the moody, ominous soundtrack.",
            "Simply more of the same gritty superhero nonsense that appeals to depressed 15-year-old boys. And it's not done all that well, either."

            "It's all slick, fizzy fun. But the film's fighting spirit gets snatched.",
            "Perfectly captures the hubbub of the nation's newsrooms.",
            "Thanks to a caffeinated cast and hyperactive script, director Ron Howard delivers The Paper with a bang.",
            "Watching The Paper got me in touch all over again with how good it feels to work at the top of your form, on a story you believe in, on deadline.",
            "A crowd pleaser, and, regardless of any viewer's experience (or lack thereof) with the behind-the-scenes wrangling that goes on in newspaper offices, the story is affable and entertaining.",
            "The inside-baseball feel of the newsroom material (co-writer Stephen Koepp did time in the trenches) is what makes 'The Paper' sing.",
            "It's clear right away that The Paper benefits substantially from Keaton's typically stellar turn as the central character...",
            "An overwrought, hysterical drama about the newspaper business that doesn't begin to compare to Hollywood's classics of the genre (The Front Page). The film has an absurdly frantic pace but it's so romantically naive and unsubtle that nothing registers",
            "One of Ron Howard's most underrated films.",
            "A great ensemble cast",
            "Not a bad view of the inner-workings at a daily",
            "Does it show how newspapers really work? Not really, but who cares? It is great fun, even if it is overdone.",
            "Enjoyable, if utterly unrealistic look at journalism",
            "Incisively depicts the ways in which busyness, speed and constant pressure violate our souls in the workplace."

            "Although you could certainly wish that Seagal and his writers... could have found less preachy ways to express themselves, On Deadly Ground is otherwise lively entertainment for action fans.",
            "''I didn't want to resort to violence. I didn't have a choice,'' [Seagal] says; a greater man might have said, ''Make my day.''",
            "This is a vanity production parading as a social statement.",
            "In contrast to his short, sharp fighting style, Seagal's presentation of the human conflicts and underlying issues consists of vague, sweeping gestures.",
            "This is more than just a vanity project for Seagal. It's also his first real stinker. It would not be his last.",
            "They may have to write a new book of Ecclesiastes to account for this one: the old \"Vanity of Vanities, All is Vanity\" just doesn't go far enough.",
            "The fuzzy thinking allows for gorgeous outdoor photography and a few too many dead spots, but Seagal the director shows real muscle by staging one of the screen's best-ever exploding helicopters.",
            "On Deadly Ground is a pip. Beautifully photographed by Ric Waite and handsomely produced, it surely is the most ambitious and the best Seagal movie to date.",
            "Seagal the director shows that he has picked up the odd trick or two from the action specialists who made his name, but his impassioned green speeches will have viewers reaching for the remote control.",
            "As a performer, Seagal is singularly lacking in grace and charisma. As a director, he more than lives up to his ham-fisted acting.",
            "A vanity project in the strongest sense of the term, this film has it all: bad acting, bad writing, bad direction, bad action sequences.",
            "You can't preach about preserving the environment and make movies full of sludge.",
            "Just what the world needs, environmental lessons from Steven Seagal.",
            "In the end, you want a good movie with message about ecology and how to preserve human nature? Forget it; go to a Green peace conference."

            "In a picture full of painful moments, it's hard to decide on the lowest point.",
            "Written with verve and played with grace, Reality Bites is too smart to pass itself off as a definitive statement, but it gets the details delightfully right. ",

            "However conventional Reality Bites resolves to be, it is always engaging. Best of all, Ryder has her greatest role since Heathers, once again proving herself a seriously funny young actress.",
            "It's a good example of an anti-establishment comedy crippled by a seeming desire to infatuate the establishment itself. What Reality Bites needs most is a good bite. From reality.",
            "...a fairly by-the-numbers setup that's employed to impressively compelling (and relatable) effect by first-time filmmaker Stiller...",
            "The deeper themes of choosing art and integrity over earning a living . . . felt phony and hollow then, and are nothing short of embarrassing to watch from a modern perspective now.",
            "Reality Bites is a legitimately good movie.",
            "Gone is the fearless savagery Stiller smuggled into his TV series. Stuck between slacker and attacker, he settles for something curiously inert, slavishly mainstream and so hopelessly phony its own characters might make fun of it between bong rips.",
            "For all its faults, this still has moments of hip charm.",
            "The screenplay by newcomer Helen Childress falls back on familiar formulas too often, but first-time director Ben Stiller keeps the action fast and involving even when you can't help guessing what the next story twist will be.",
            "The smart script by 23-year-old newcomer Helen Childress doesn't lose sight of the characters and the issues that affect them and other young adults.",
            "The best -- the brilliant -- bits of Reality Bites etch in epigram, anecdote and brittle, dazzling dialogue the inner life of young people who want desperately to believe but haven't decided in what.",
            "Among the movie's strengths are the performances, especially that of Ryder, who comes across as bright, beautiful and more delicate than ever before.",
            "When the movie is over, you don't feel as if you had shared the experience of a new generation; you feel puzzled and vaguely crummy, as if you had just read a solemn news-magazine cover story about it.",
            "Yearning, hilarious, lost within their precocious self-awareness, these slackers have soul.",
            "Comedy about 20-something slackers isn't for kids.",
            "Remember Gen X? This is why you forgot it.",

            "A romantic heart, caustic wit, and the energy of its fresh cast ensure the film's continued appeal.",

            "In 1994, the novelty of seeing a romantic comedy written and directed by, as well as starring, people in their early 20s made for a certain freshness, but after a point this 'youthfulness' consists of little more than TV references.",

            "You can tell that they like each other by the way they hate each other. Shakespeare may have invented the recipe, Tracy and Hepburn may have refined it, but Nolte and Roberts certainly hold their own.",
            "The lack of chemistry onscreen allows the paper-thin premise to collapse in on itself, and there's very little else left to salvage.",
            "There's a pervasive romanticism in I Love Trouble that depends on the chemistry generated by Roberts and Nolte.",

            "Slick camera work and strong chemistry between the stars are almost enough to save the picture from terminal triteness, but not quite.",
            "The goings-on seem lacking in wit and inspiration, tolerably entertaining but far from effervescent.",
            "Age difference and lack of chemistry between Nick Nolte and Julia Roberts are just two of many problems that mar this pale imitation (really pastiche) of 40s screwball comedies by Howard Hawks and George Cukor.",

            "Getaway is pretty much a 90-minute car chase. That's it.",
            "There is something to be said for boosting that Bulgarian economy.",

            "For all of its vices, I can't help but think that we've brought Getaway on ourselves. It's not the car chase film we need right now, but it's probably the car chase movie we deserve. And if the finale is any indication, a sequel could be ready to go.",

            "While the seemingly endless car chase has many literal gear changes, Getaway as a film is a monotone experience.",
            "It's mildly diverting, and it clearly hopes you won't point out if not its inconsistencies, then areas where it could have tried harder.",
            "Getaway feels like a project that was undercooked, needing snappier dialogue, better shot coverage in its action sequences, and especially a heavier dose of macho charisma.",
            "If you like car crashes and bizarre casting pairings, have I got a movie for you! If you like good movies, yeah, not so much."

            "A tough, complex story [told] with clarity, compassion and considerable dramatic force.",
            "In the lead roles, both Robbins and Freeman are outstanding, layering their performances with snippets of individuality: Their small, daily sustenances and minor triumphs are wonderfully inspiring.",
            "This is an engagingly simple, good-hearted film, with just enough darkness around the edges to give contrast and relief to its glowingly benign view of human nature.",
            "Simply marvelous entertainment.",
            "Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing.",
            "A magnificently hopeful, inspiring work of art.",
            "Creates a stellar vision that teaches, challenges, inspires, and evokes a wide array of emotions and thoughts.",
            "Masterfully written and directed by Frank Darabont, Shawshank well deserves its adoration.",
            "And the final scene? I'm not crying, you're crying.",
            "The problem with the film's fablistic flooziness is that it also asks for investment in the harsh realities of its prison arena to buy the later Andy and Red push for freedom.",
            "One of the best out of the 1990s, and a towering force of dramatic power amongst films of its kind.",
            "It has the novelty to use plot development rather than unnecessary shock treatments to move forward.",
            "Top-notch performances, exceptional cinematography, and masterful direction combine to make this film something special indeed. ",
            "Powerful, poignant, thought-provoking and finally irresistibly uplifting.",

            "...itself a testament to overcoming odds. It is sentimental and stereotyped, yet we are able not only to suspend our disbelief but to root for it all the way.",

            "It's an old-school melodrama at heart, sturdy and forthright and upstanding, but without a whisper of complexity or wit.",

            "What counts is the comic tension between MacLaine and Cage. It's so well done, it doesn't matter how dumb things get.",

            "...an erratic yet rewarding star vehicle.",
            "Maclaine's performance as Tess Carlisle, which shifts from polite witchiness to lonely, mildly boozy poignancy, adds up to the only real reason to see this potentially funny and revealing, but actually rather humdrum duodrama.",
            "Too often Guarding Tess feels like a sketch towards a movie.",

            "Deftly written by Richard Curtis and directed by the versatile Mike Newell, Four Weddings is as good as its word, breezily following a small circle of friends through every one of the events the title promises.",
            "Four Weddings and a Funeral is one of those rare films that have you smiling from the get-go, and keep you that way -- with a few well-earned poignant interludes (including, of all things, a reading of W.H. Auden) -- right to the end.",
            "Hugh Grant's body English captures every nuance of his character's confusion precisely and hilariously.",
            "The setup is too arch to support the movie's detour into poignance, though John Hannah does give a moving reading of W. H. Auden's \"Funeral Blues.\"",
            "A likable, heartwarming bit of entertainment that propelled Grant's career and proved to be box office gold.",
            " It doesn't matter how many times you see it, you're always going to smile.",
            "In a sense, these young, moneyed, unattached, attractive folks could just as easily exist in the universe of a Whit Stillman film. Yet Curtis and Newell ultimately have hearts too soft to deny them, or us, at least a bit of \"true love\" sentimentality.",
            "Richard Curtis's screenplay is a celebration, and the film's success is that we end up celebrating with it.",
            "Most of the acting is first-rate, with special credit going to Grant as the hero and Simon Callow in a memorable supporting role.",
            "The pitch-perfect profanity, bumbling romanticism and Hugh Grant's floppy-fringed charm remain enduringly, endearingly funny.",
            "Four Weddings and a Funeral is a rare movie commodity, an adult comedy that takes a mostly smart, mordant approach to such topics as sex and romance.",
            "If anyone asks if you want to see Four Weddings and a Funeral, just say \"I do.\"",
            "Neatly structured and full of genuine warmth for its characters, Richard Curtis's Oscar-nominated screenplay is superbly observed and well served by Mike Newell's deft direction.",
            "As directed with a light touch by Mike Newell, there's little doubt as to where it is going or how it will be resolved. That's all right, since getting there is so much fun.",
            "The movie dazzles with its slick lines, but there's a situational intelligence at play too.",
            "Conveys everything that is hilariously and poignantly true about the ceremonies we use to tie the knot and bid loved ones farewell.",
            "Not everything works out neatly for everyone, but life seems a little better by the end of two hours' struggle, for the characters and for the audience. [Blu-ray]",
            "Sexy, funny, romantic comedy at its finest.",
            "British films are rarely as funny or as charming.",
            "The infectious charm and sunny goodwill of Four Weddings and a Funeral can so immediately buoy a soul ravaged by winter weather and winter movies.",
            "There are movies so breezy, even flimsy, that you can enjoy them as genial providers of an evening's entertainment yet forget all about them by the time you leave the multiplex.",
            "A witty romantic comedy with a sardonic edge."

            "Lee is a great self-promoter. After all his press releases and all his interviews, we are given films that are sketchy, unfelt and distancing -- incidents in Lee's career, the only drama that really interests him.",
            "The key problem is that the film is simply a ragged series of anecdotal sketches.",
            "It's the first Spike Lee film with the potential to be turned into a television show. More important, it's the first one to display real warmth of heart.",
            "This remarkable movie will haunt you for a good long time.",
            "Lee is as talented as any director is capturing an era, and some of the early scenes perfectly recall the mood of the time. The pop soundtrack may be a little too obvious, but it gets the job done.",
            "Nuanced depiction of a black family in Brooklyn; language. ",
            "In spite of the flaws of the Virginia interlude I really enjoyed this.",
            "...a relaxed portrayal of African-American domesticity, anchored by strong performances.",
            "Crooklyn, a gentle and touching tale of growing up in a melting-pot neighborhood of Brooklyn in the Partridge Family era, shows a different, more sentimental side of that cinematic firebrand, Spike Lee.",
            "While Lee fails to impose sufficient structure on his material, expertly drawn performances help vividly to evoke the family and street life of an era untroubled by crack or drive-by shootings.",
            "It's not Lee's most challenging work, but it's certainly amongst his most charming.",
            "A sub-par vision of Brooklyn with some bright spots",
            "An affectionate look at youthful adventures.",
            "Loosely based on Spike Lee's growing up in Brooklyn in the 1970s, the casual, warm, apolitical (for Lee) script took a life of its own during the development process.",
            "One of Lee's more modest but admirable pieces.",
            "Um dos melhores trabalhos de Spike Lee, este filme foi solenemente ignorado pela Academia - uma mancha que o Oscar carregar\u00e1 para sempre em seu hist\u00f3rico.",
            "Standard Spike Lee fare, which means it comes with its high and low points.",
            "Uneven Lee film -- and the reel printed in uncorrected 'scope is a really bad idea.",
            "An idiosyncratic domestic drama written and directed by Spike Lee",
            "An ambitious failure from Spike Lee."

            "A backstage comedy bolstered by healthy shots of prohibition gangster melodrama and romantic entanglements.",
            "No! Don't speak! See it!",
            "Mr. Allen has drawn on autobiographical specifics in other films, but this may be the one in which he speaks most seriously from the heart.",

            "One of Woody Allen's flat-out funniest movies.",
            "Dianne Wiest elevates even the most esoteric argument in the film to a level of sublime entertainment.",

            "Overrated.",
            "Essentially a backstage comedy about artists and gangsters in 1920s New York, the film doesn't break any new ground but it's pleasantly amusing and benefits from charming turns from Diane Wiest as the grand dame and John Cusack as the young artist.",
            "You can watch Bullets Over Broadway with the sound off and have a thrilling time. You can listen to it from the next room and achieve total bliss.",
