            "Captain America: Civil War is fun; it's too well made, acted and scripted for it to be anything less.",
            "The real key to Captain America: Civil War is its sense of inevitability, and its acceptance that sometimes things change-they change big.",
            "It's this light-heartedness that keeps Captain America: Civil War from succumbing to the kind of pretentiousness that marred Batman V. Superman.",
            "It's this levity that makes the much-touted battle royale between Team Cap and Team Iron Man so much fun.",
            "On the surface, it's one superhero against another. Deep down, it's two friends being separated due to a difference in ideology.",
            "Captain America: Civil War isn't a flawless film, though I'm guessing most diehard fans will be more in awe of it than newcomers to the Marvel universe.",
            "Captain America: Civil War is what Avengers 2 should have been.",
            "Civil War as a whole was a well done accumulation of previous themes and atonement for the events that occurred in previous Marvel installments. ",
            "This is the peak of Marvel's long form storytelling approach thus far-a jumping off point for things to come.",
            "The film is ... unexpectedly emotional. With the question of friendships and loyalties on the line, the plot does a good job of showing how these tensions honestly affect the characters deep down.",
            "It's a regular movie that looks like a trailer of The Avengers. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "It's fatiguing.",
            "I don't have time for this plotline anymore.",
            "Captain America: Civil War is muscular filmmaking, but never at the expense of character or ideas.",
            "In the end, Captain America: Civil War is an entertaining film while dealing with complex human emotions.",
            "It's also packed with stellar action sequences, flashes of humor, and chemistry among the characters that are sheer fun to watch.",
            "Captain America: Civil War is a fun time at the movies, and among the best of its breed, but you can be excused if you feel superhero fatigue setting in.",
            "In prior films, Steve Rogers was never given a clear ideological enemy. Here, as if to finally course-correct this omission, the series uses his divestment from ideology as a dramatic question: who does Captain America truly fight for?",
            "The Russos definitely know how to stage an action scene.",
            "Captain America: Civil War is a truly epic and gigantic super hero film with on point emotional moments and the best action sequences to date. ",
            "There is a conviction of purpose that infuses every aspect of Captain America: Civil War. Be it within the characters or the script or the lensing, confidence in purpose abounds at every turn.",
            "\"Captain America: Civil War\" is a much better version of \"Batman v Superman.\" Not only does the film juggle a dozen major superheroes pretty seamlessly, but it manages to tell a cohesive story without making the film feel too stuffed."

            "While not a film likely to have a lot in the way of staying power, I still enjoyed Zoolander 2, the sequel reminding me that Stiller is a creatively inspired director who should probably step behind the camera more often than he right now does.",
            "Failing to tap into practically any of the charm of its predecessor is Zoolander 2, a supposed comedy devoid of practically any creativity and humor.",
            "One of the most unnecessary sequels of all time (yes, I've seen Speed 2).",
            "Agonizingly paced and bewilderingly outdated, Ben Stiller's long-awaited sequel is a sad march through every single joke from the 2001 original.",
            "Silly jokes and A-list cameos pass the time, but it's pretty much more of the same from Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell and the rest of the gang.",
            "Filled with half-baked ideas that could use a whole lot more cooking.",
            "Whether he did it for nostalgic reasons or by outside influence, going back to this character feels like a weak attempt at capturing old glory. In other words, Ben Stiller is better than this.",
            "Zoolander 2 is a pointless, soulless rehash that appears to go out of its way to avoid any sort of fun or intelligence. ",
            "Even though the film squandered its potential by setting its sights much higher than they ever really needed to be, it was great to see Derek Zoolander back on the big screen.",
            "Zoolander 2 is heavy on cameos but light on laughs.",
            "Directed by [Ben] Stiller, the work is serviceable but not outstanding, save for the film serving as a compact travelogue for Rome.",
            "Zoolander 2 exists in its own fabricated world rather than acting as a satirical spin on the more absurd elements of our own.",
            "ZOOLANDER 2 is a true stinker, the kind of unfunny, nap-inducing comedy likely to be a future Razzie nominee.",
            "Stiller's script has some fun with the common sequel trap of repeating old plot points and jokes, but doesn't escape it entirely. It's a relief then that the jokes about the series' new target - hipsters - land as successfully as before.",
            "Zoolander 2 made me laugh, so there you go.",
            "There are a couple of genuine laughs, but the film fails to provide anything new and turns into a strange spy-type race to save the day and only proves to be underwhelming and forgettable overall.",
            "The plot's as uninteresting and flat as it sounds, a trashy send-up of the international spy thriller that chose to spoof that genre seemingly arbitrarily. But all that could be quickly forgiven with some good, solid comedy.",
            "Derek Zoolander and company have definitely fallen out of fashion.",
            "I probably laughed, or at least was amused, at about three out of every 10 jokes in \"Zoolander 2.\" That's a good percentage if you are a baseball player at the plate, but not good for a comedy.",
            "[Stiller and Wilson] emerge...wearing orange jumpsuits bearing the labels \"Old\" and \"Lame.\" Those labels are perfect descriptions of this unnecessary sequel.",
            "Zoolander 2, much like the Nehru jacket and clog shoes, is a freakish fashion statement that should be buried in the past permanently.",
            "Zoolander 2 manages to maintain its tone throughout, and it is consistently silly. It is also sometimes funny, though not nearly enough to warrant how long it feels. ",
            "I believe that this wasn't a cash grab, that they actually tried and cared...but this just wasn't good."

            "Eddie the Eagle is one of those underdog sports stories we all love so much, with an excellent performance from the likeable, empathetic Hugh Jackman. ",
            "Peary is a completely fictitious character, but Jackman plays him like a younger Clint Eastwood, full of rugged charm and common sense, even though he stresses over his own past failures.",
            "It is both folk and fairy tale, but sort of irresistible. Everyone loves a rags-to-riches story, even if Eddie never quite won the riches.",
            "It's a recipe that worked for Rudy and Cool Runnings, and it's effective here.",
            "Picked up the Truly Moving Picture Award from Indy's own Heartland Film.",
            "Few films are this delightful and positive - I challenge you not to get swept up in Eddie's story and root for him along the way.",
            "Overall, Eddie the Eagle is formulaic, heartfelt and full of feel-good vibes.",
            "Despite its flaws, Eddie the Eagle boasts a strong cast, good script and, like Eddie himself, a lot of heart. Watch it at least once. You won't regret it.",
            "This film isn't quite a medal winner -- but it's definitely a crowd-pleaser.",
            "The film could so easily have made Eddie a figure of fun. Instead it turns an underdog into a very British kind of hero.",
            "I found myself cheering for Eddie and his dogged optimism.",
            "\"Eddie the Eagle\" is uncomplicated by nature and is a feel-good, warm-your-heart kind of film that will have you rooting for Eddie by the end of it. ",
            "Much like the real Eddie Edwards, the film may not soar as high as loftier biopics, but it's a heartwarmer.",
            "There are no revolutionary changes made to the underdog formula, but the movie is special in that it celebrates the pride one finds in the simple act of participation.",
            "It's a fun little dramedy that offers some laughs and some triumphs and some big sappy feelings, nothing more. And what's wrong with that?",
            "It's fluff, but it's charming fluff that ultimately works well.",
            "Eddie the Eagle is far from perfect, but I'll be damned if it didn't charm my socks off.",
            "The predictability can be a turn-off to some and even the feel-good and wholesome tone can be a bit much but overall, Eddie the Eagle is a fun time.",
            "There are better sports movies out there, but despite its many flaws, Eddie the Eagle has enough moments when it soars to provide what adds up to a pretty good time, which also makes us want to know more about the real person. ",
            "I've seen it all before, but I didn't mind seeing it again.",
            "Eddie Edwards has an unbreakable spirit and undying determination to achieve his lifelong dream that is impossible to not respect",

            "The microphones on the tiny digital cameras shouldn't be picking up much, but verisimilitude be damned, because Blair Witch renders every snapped stick, crushed leaf, and distant guttural noise as an ear-blistering assault.",
            "If you're scared of twigs this movie will have you urinating in the aisles.",

            "Loud noises and shaky cameras don't replace a plot, and Blair Witch doesn't have one. It also lacks the fresh documentary feel that set its predecessor apart.",
            "Blair Witch is a valiant effort to recreate the original's alchemy, but it's no substitute for the real thing. Whatever that is.",
            "Things naturally play out as expected - both for the black couple and for everyone else involved, a disappointingly pedestrian outcome for a reboot of such a landmark film.",

            "Ask yourself: do you feel like watching another 90 minutes of The Blair Witch Project? Your answer will tell you all that you need to know about Blair Witch.",
            "Barrett and Wingard did interesting things with the legacy of such a beloved piece of horror cinema.",
            "Wingard and Barrett deliver a short, sharp movie with scares, shocks and solid characters. It's impressive that they've been able to revive a franchise many thought would remain extinct.",
            "Dream team Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett bring an unusually hit-and-miss affair that nevertheless delivers in a frenetic final act.",
            "Sure, the sequel has higher-quality video and more cameras and even some drone shots, but it doesn't have much in the way of soul.",
            "It does have a charm and personality that shines through. It does a lot of stuff that's different, but also does a lot of the same. I want to see it again.",
            "La bruja de Blair no s\u00f3lo fracasa como una continuaci\u00f3n, sino tambi\u00e9n como un found footage en general. En vista de que nadie pidi\u00f3 esta secuela - la primera entrega funciona perfectamente tal y como es -, ya podemos dar por muerta a esta leyenda.",
            "Ultimately Blair Witch doesn't work because it feels too much like the same film from 17 years ago and not a film that can separate and stand on its own.",
            "Structurally redundant as it travels down the familiar wooden path...it is too bad that he (Wingard) could not emphasize his cinematic appreciation more soundly in this woefully flaccid, forest-bound frightener.",
            "It is without a doubt one of the bleakest, most depressing American genre films of all time."

            "I think the film is best viewed as a victory lap. And why not? It's a very well deserved one.",
            "I just wish the film itself did more than play so blatantly to the fan base, because had it broadened its appeal and its reach just a little bit more, it's quite possible we could have had something amazing here to be talking about.",
            "Absolutely Fabulous walks a tart line between embracing celebrity culture and rejecting it.",
            "Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie could've been a hilarious meditation on ageing, fame and the desperate human desire to be relevant, but except for a couple of rare moments of clarity, it's as shallow as Eddie and Patsy.",
            "I won't spoil the movie's ending, but its twist is surprisingly gratifying.",
            "If you're considering coming in cold, you're probably better off binging on the '90s heyday of the show instead, but if AbFab's already on your list of not-so-guilty pleasures, you'll find a lot to like.",
            "Absolutely fabulous it is not - every now and again a little bit fabulous at a stretch.",

            "Well, Britain's bombastic booze-loving fashion figureheads are back for some familiar naughty fun and frolicking, so committed \"AbFab\" fans can rejoice...off-kilter and shrewdly amusing",
            "Celebrating a culture that is past its prime and being too serious are two grave errors that keep Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie from itself being fabulous.",
            "Absolutely Fabulous is trashy obsession masquerading as satire, slobbering over the same puffy lifestyle that Zoolander burst into absurdity.",
            "Pacing is extremely uneven, which perhaps was intentional because it works so well with the long established schtick. If it feels like a strand of sloppy skits, it's supposed to, my dear -- that's part of its charm.",
            "Fortunately for us, laughing from the sidelines, even decades of trouble-and a couple of international incidents-can't dim Eddy's and Patsy's voracious lust for life.",
            "For the most part Ab Fab: The Movie is confused celebrity-laden chaos weighed down by too many cameo appearances and not enough story to sustain a full feature. ",
            "It's really only for the Ab Fab loyal, but if you're a sweetie darling, Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie is a satisfying trip back into Patsy and Edina's self-obsessed world.",
            "[It] features wall-to-wall cameos from designers and supermodels past and present. Which isn't to say you have to be au courant to get all the jokes.",
            "They may not be at their most fabulous, but they're still good value.",
            "As a movie, there's not much there, but it's still touching when Eddie admits their outrageous antics are their only defense against the fear of getting old and obsolete.",
            "One does not have to have a long history with Edina Monsoon and Patsy Stone to enjoy the film version of this friendship, a folie \u00e0 deux.",
            "You'd hope it would have matured like a fine vintage champagne, but unfortunately Absolutely Fabulous is one franchise that hasn't aged well.",
            "Little else about Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie may justify its existence or demonstrate its relevance, but reuniting its leads with viewers does enough.",
            "Although the film isn't completely able to avoid the pitfalls of adaptation... Ab Fab: The Movie is, for the most part, a thoroughly entertaining showcase for some of Britain's funniest women."

            "Just as it taps into a dying corner of American society, Hell or High Water resurrects the power of western mayhem done right.",
            "This neo-Western works splendidly as a self-contained tale of loyalty, loss and redemption, with polished turns from a smoldering Chris Pine and spunky Ben Foster.",
            "Hell or High Water is a contemporary western with pick-up trucks instead of horses. But some things never change.",
            "There's not a moment out of place, not a shot that stays too long. If [David McKenzie] makes a better film in his career, he'll be lucky.",
            "There's no Bonnie and Clyde-style glamour but the film has an emotional depth that you don't often find in a heist thriller.",
            "A smartly crafted heist thriller that quietly peels back the layers from its macho male characters to reveal the pain and tenderness inside.",
            "Unquestionably one of the best films of 2016, Hell or High Water benefits greatly from an ensemble cast that acts like an ensemble cast.",
            "Being a movie about police chasing thieves it has a disturbing tension that has hooked me from start to finish. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "It's a really good movie.",
            "I almost loved this movie.",
            "We need a palate cleanser to get us ready for Oscar season. Hell or High Water is just the thing. Filled with indelible characters, sneaky humor, and mournful intelligence, it's a film that deserves to be seen.",
            "Hell or High Water is appropriately elegiac for its subject matter, but Sheridan's script still offers many wry and humorous moments.",
            "A great example of what happens when all the components of a film come together in cooperative fashion.",
            "I'm not sure Jeff Bridges makes a bad film anymore, but if he does, he is usually the bright spot. True to form, he plays his character well.",
            "Unexpectedly pulsing with a deep social conscience.",
            "The great achievement here is its decadent atmosphere about its anti-corporative attitude, a depressing situation that can be the push that the neo-Western needs to return the genre to its true glory. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "David Mackenzie carves nuance out of the wide-open spaces and fills the screen with silence in a portrait of an America knockin' on heaven's door.",
            "Unlike earlier entries in the genre, the movie blurs the line between good and bad and right and wrong. While it's completely entertaining, it's that added layer that makes Hell or High Water completely satisfying.",
            "Director David Mitchell and screenwriter Taylor Sheridan give Hell or High Water a poignant touch by setting the action in West Texas; here, the West isn't disappearing, it's gone.",
            "Hell or High Water epitomises the economic struggle of people clinging to old ways of life in a world moving further into modernity every minute, for better or worse.",
            "[Director David Mackenzie] does a tremendous job capturing a sense of place and tone.",
            "Direction, camera, sound, and performance coalesce as HOHW achieves the tricky balancing act of taking on many incongruous moods and making them complement one another perfectly.",
            "The joy of the movie is in the shots of the wide, harsh landscapes and the empty towns, its way with words, the great acting all round from fine actors.",
            "A detailed and careful observation of the damage caused by the 2008 recession in some Texas towns. [Full Review in Spanish]"

            "Snowden, while not the unmitigated disaster Alexander was, doesn't quite qualify as a return to form.",
            "Snowden is a plodding, pedantic exercise in how not to approach culturally compelling material, featuring one of the most laughable lead performances in an alleged prestige picture. ",
            "Snowden is a missed opportunity, a subject that might have been better in the hands of a different director, regardless of Stone's considerable talent.",
            "While there's intrigue a-plenty and a compelling lead performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the titular Edward Snowden, the director never quite manages to amp the energy up to the level necessary to match reality. ",
            "Gordon-Levitt embodies this complex, decidedly private and controversial public figure seamlessly.",
            "SNOWDEN finds a way to be simultaneously fast-moving and painfully sluggish.",
            "A biopic about a man of great courage with none of its own.",
            "If you love Edward Snowden, you'll probably enjoy Snowden. If you have mixed feeling about Edward Snowden, you'll probably have mixed feeling about Snowden.",
            "In sum, the questions that Snowden raises are essential to understand our time, but Stone's version is not adequate to address them. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Snowden works intermittently, and it's interesting. We can even get intellectually roused about its topics. But it never gets visceral.",

            "\"Snowden\" is full of thrills and chills. It thoroughly builds up tension and suspense, but doesn't really add anything in terms of what we already know about the title character.",
            "If anything, this cautionary tale, anchored by a tender love story, is a meditation on mentorship, and its intrinsic positivity rises above the film's more clunky elements."

            "A film that's as clunky as its title.",
            "It's not odd like Attack of the 500-Foot Lobster. It's odd in fashions you wouldn't expect from one of our era's cleverest and most versatile filmmakers.",
            "The film has neither topical immediacy nor any real historical perspective and, burdened with pedantic and predictable flashbacks, it finally leads nowhere interesting at all.",
            "Ideally, Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk shouldn't play like a demo reel for new technology Ang Lee wishes to unveil. Unfortunately, it does.",
            "Left me empty and baffled -- probably not the best combination of feelings to have about a movie that is meant to inspire empathy and compassion.",
            "A bit clunky and corny, but sincerely intent on providing a realistic portrait of wartime causalities, both during and after battle.",
            "Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk might well mark a significant step forward in the evolution of filmmaking. However, important is not necessarily the same as good and this movie, despite its best intentions, is ultimately just not very good.",

            "Ang Lee succeeds in bringing to the screen a perspective that, if not exactly new, is certainly affecting and emotionally meaningful.",
            "With \"Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk,\" Ang Lee deems to make a poignant film, but it is bogged down by too many subplots, bad dialogue, and a general lack of cohesiveness. ",
            "Leaving the actors aside, however, the real problem with the film is the way it is shot. ",
            "The biggest takeaway from Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Long though is that Joe Alwyn, a British actor capable of astonishingly nailing a heavy southern drawl accent, just became a star in his debut performance",
            "This one's effective in portions, but falls short of holding your undivided attention.",
            "An unstructured satire. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "For a movie that wants to be about the hidden wounds of war, Billy Lynn is long walk into a cold and disaffected room.",
            "The degree of realism is going to terrify actors, although it's interesting to see the likes of Steve Martin, Vin Diesel and a particularly impressive Garrett Hedlund all rising to the occasion.",
            "Billy is so cliched as to be a photocopy.",
            "A heavy-handed but accurate social satire on the Iraq War and America's nauseating attempt to package it as a necessary war back home.",
            "Never mind the technical innovations, Stewart and the affecting newcomer Alwyn are the two main reasons why Billy Lynn deserves our votes this week.",
            "A movie that explores, nearly as well as The Best Years of Our Lives, the gap that divides actual warriors from those who merely wave flags in their honor."

            "It's undoubtedly a pickle moving forward, but it's an interesting one. ",

            "The narration, delivered by actor John Krasinski with a curdled dollop of aw-shucks geniality, reduces the seasonal narrative to incidents that are mapped to human cliches - a loving mother know best and a rebellious teen has to deal with his father",
            "'Born in China' shows the beauty of the cycle of life and death.",
            "Disney knows on which side their bread is buttered, and there's nothing like a baby panda being cradled by its mother to make an audience go \"Awww.\" ",

            "Born in China captures the beauty of China's wild spaces, and the charm of its creatures, in ways that will delight and educate viewers of all ages.",

            "While this film achieves that goal to a certain effect, mostly through beautiful wildlife photography, it does hamper itself in certain areas, leading to rather uneven product.",

            "The interrelations between characters may be superficial and there's a &#8232;wearisome didactic element, but this new film contains some powerful &#8232;scenes...Free State doesn't fail to generate interest, even if it lacks any cinematic distinction.",
            "Director Gary Ross treats the movie like a glorified history lesson complete with shockingly amateur and inept filmmaking decisions at every corner",
            "A tad too long and tad too inconsistent, the only respectability that Free State Of Jones retains is thanks to Matthew McConaughey's performance. ",
            "It's a potentially fascinating piece of Americana but McConaughey gives one of his vainer, more posturing performances in a film that eventually outstays its welcome.",
            "Free State of Jones is too boring to be bad in an interesting way and too infuriating to be bad in a fun way. It can best be summed up in four words: Whitesplaining the Civil War.",
            "What does not play so true is the production value of Free State of Jones. So often the acting and enacting are wooden, the make-up a few smears of mud on a face. The film could have used subtitles.",
            "Essentially, it's a messy movie about an even messier stretch of ugly American history that would've fared better as a prestige miniseries.",
            "Free State of Jones contains so much story that it might have been better served in a longer format. But as it is, the film is a mess.",
            "The picture is, if nothing else, a fascinating historical footnote. Major kudos to McConaughey for using his post-Oscar clout - and for having the courage (and the ego) - to bring this little-known story to light.",
            "Free State of Jones is a worthy experience, both instructive and provocative -- a lot of what goes on here is starting to look too familiar for comfort.",
            "McConaughey plays Newton Knight in one key, the key of righteous indignation, just what the story calls for."

            "There is plenty in Kung Fu Panda 3 that echoes the first film and the sequel, but it's not tired recycling. Instead, the movie deftly reinforces and extends what has gone before.",
            "The film is simultaneously sweet, simple and savvy.",

            "Apart from an unnecessary profusion of subplots, you'll likely find this heist-thriller to be quite satisfying.",

            "With its candy-coated color palette and Emma Stone's earth-shattering performance, there's plenty of love found within La La Land.",
            "It makes it more difficult to just let something like La La Land just passively wash over you when, however well-intentioned, the film hearkens back to a time when black humanity onscreen was deliberately hamstrung.",
            "The movie has charm, at least, if nothing else. And as an attempt to pay homage to a vanishing world, La La Land is as dutiful as it is endearing&#8202;-&#8202;sweet, if a little sour, too.",
            "It's a story as old as Hollywood and jazz, and Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone feel like a pairing for the ages.",

            "La La Land 's biggest failing is its complacency...",
            "The clash of styles and ideas are collectively embraced. It's the balance of cheese meets whimsical. Romance meets heartbreak. An old tradition meets modern ways. A sincere heart meets good fun - and La La Land completely owns it, in its own magical way",
            "It basks in the wonder and excitement of young love, the optimism of the dreamer, the nostalgia of classic Hollywood, and the emotion of musical fantasy. ",
            "It has a powerful message that lifts you from your chair, pulls you by the ears and forces you to continue with the task of fulfilling your dream. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Pairing a filmmaker with maybe the best sense of cinematic rhythm working today with elaborate choreography, old Hollywood style musical arrangements, and two of the industry's most charming performers is a stroke of enchanting genius.",
            "The meta qualities of La La Land, which have led many to call it a love letter to classic musical films, owe a great deal to this [atmospheric framing] device.",
            "Its charm tells us that the magic of musicals is still more alive than ever. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "An engaging tussle, an original vision and a wonderful reboot of the Golden Age of Tinseltown musicals.",
            "I have so many feelings about how much I hated this movie.",
            "It was a pretentious waste of my time.",
            "If La La Land brings the genre back to vitality, I'll rejoice. But while much of this movie is clever and enjoyable, I can't say I found it exciting.",
            "It's exquisite, unforgettable, and utterly heartbreaking.",
            "Damien Chazelle has clearly established himself as one of today's great genre directors in all things musical.",
            "Do yourself a favor and catch La La Land. It's a necessary reminder that romance, triumph, and hope don't just exist in the movies.",
            "La La Land is visually stunning and goes from feat to feat (the opening sequence set on a freeway is one for the books), yet it remains profoundly human. ",
            "It'll have your heart aching with joy and yearning; its tunes will linger in your brain and hopefully weave a little bit of its magic into your life. Falling in love with it is inevitable.",

            "It's more concerned with flattering our modern sensibility than truly plunging us into the mores of the 1920s.",
            "It's not Goodfellas. It lacks the black humour and the relish for eccentricity for its own sake, and the ending verges on mawkishness. But it's great entertainment -- a cunningly wrought tribute to old-fashioned Hollywood and the Warners style.",
            "You probably won't turn it off when it comes on cable. But the material needs to be bigger, more momentous, as well as more intimate.",

            "In some ways, this film is a leap ahead for Affleck - it is his most visually impressive. Perhaps he should go back to original screenwriting, rather than adapting, next time and see if he can reach the dizzy heights of Good Will Hunting once more. ",
            "Affleck continues to showcase his talents as a director. The film is slick and stylish, with some great individual shots and scenes ... Unfortunately, his skill behind the camera can't fix the averageness of the plot.",
            "It's a measured, leisurely stroll through an outlaw's life that puts more value on character development than slinging lead.",
            "Ben Affleck's really weird gangster film is a dud.",
            "There are morsels of pleasure to be found here and there... No, it's not garbage. It's just a formless affair that feels destined to be relegated to the 2 and a half star pile on Netflix. It's a shame.",
            "Costume design, ambiance, production design and photography are magnificent, but what really draws attention is Affleck's visual ability, much more ambitious than the rest of his filmography. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "Let no one call Live By Night unwatchable. Instead, let it be shown to every douchey, arrogant white filmmaker dude itching to ape Scorsese without putting in the work or possessing the talent. ",
            "It is quite disappointing that [Affleck's] latest project, Live by Night, fails to deliver anything interesting, compelling, or original.",
            "Live by Night is a hubristic endeavour from a filmmaker who should have known better.",
            "Live By Night suffers for trying to do too much. Even with a running time over two hours, it manages to feel overstuffed; one suspects that Affleck the writer got hung up on trying to preserve too much of the source material.",
            "At its best, Live by Night recalls other gangster flicks like Road to Perdition, Carlito's Way, and The Untouchables, but it fails to sustain their level of gravitas. ",
            "gradually realizing that not only isn't it good but that it's never going to become good feels like a small-scale slow-motion tragedy",
            "Tommy guns, bootleggers, fedoras and molls - Ben Affleck's Live By Night has everything you would want from a 1930s gangster drama. ",
            "Although Live by Night has the standard two-hour runtime, it somehow manages to feel both too languid and too rushed.",
            "A wrongheaded attempt at a noir thriller that manages to make cinema's coolest genre look utterly, irredeemably ridiculous."

            "The central joke, that even the most ruthless underworld drug wholesalers are putty in the paws of an adorably cute kitten, is a good one, but it's not enough to sustain an entire movie.",

            "Has its moments of good fun, but like many before them who have discovered the difficulty of making the comic transition from small screen to big screen, Key and Peele's first venture into the movies seems ultimately disposable.",
            "As a clever, kooky comedy with the expected touch of satire usually served up by its stars, Keanu is repeatedly watchable for the fans of Key and Peele, as well as fans of kittens everywhere.",
            "As a recent comedy goes, Keanu is above average and works on many levels. The story was cute and the cat(s) even cuter - not to mention pretty good at acting.",
            "Keanu is basically a 90+ minute sketch from the \"Key & Peele\" show. And that does make it derivative at times, with several obvious riffs on their best bits. But it's also nonstop, top-to-bottom funny in every avenue available. ",
            "The story is a classic fish out of water, bromance vehicle that many TV-to-film stories follow when they first make the jump onto the silver screen.",
            "A bit uneven at times, but when it fires it's as funny and smart as anything in recent memory.",
            "A funny and endearing tale about Keanu the gangster cat, or as I like to call him the bogeyman. I mean the cat they send to kill the bogeyman. The action is a perfect parody of a Wick-ian ballet with soaring music and slo-mo backflips against pillars.",
            "Keegan Micheal Key and Jordan Peele's KEANU is an utter disappointment. It had the opportunity to be a great progressive comedy that unintentionally neglects the obvious social commentary.",
            "Between bong hits, bullets, and kitten stunts, Keanu attempts to answer the question: what makes a man in the 21st century?",
            "A valiant attempt at an absurd concept, which unfortunately uses up its 9 lives long before the film's conclusion.",
            "The action is intense, the jokes frequent, and the kitten is almost shockingly adorable. ",
            "The action actually tries to compete with John Wick, which was awesome. I enjoyed it, watch it at least once.",
            "Thoroughly funny and inventive comedy that prospers from an actual script and the chemistry between Key and Peele.",
            "If a kitten caught in the middle of a drug war seems like a thin premise for a 90-minute film, hang in there, baby, there's more to it than that.",
            "It's not that the jokes aren't funny ... it's that each turns into a stuffed equine punching bag by the end of the film.",
            "Decidedly patchy, but when the comedy works Keanu is an inspired comedy treat. And yes, the kitten is very cute."

            "Though the film as a whole is confused and convoluted, Katabuchi leaves us with a hopeful conclusion and worthy salute to the power and sanctuary of the imagination.",
            "Based on a manga of the same name director Sunao Katabuchi has created a moving slice of life film that will dive you right into what it was like to live in World War II Japan.",
            "In This Corner of the World works best when its focuses on the smaller moments rooted in its characters and brought to life by the team of dedicated artists. Unfortunately, that's not always the case in this lengthy tale of life during wartime.",

            "I found the plot slow and while sometimes I can get through that, the character arcs weren't there either to really draw me back in.",

            "A perceptive, accomplished seriocomedy, \"Edge of Seventeen\" feels like a gay-p.o.v. version of the deft early-to-mid-'80s John Hughes teen pics, even revisiting their era for trendy (but well-deployed) nostalgia value",
            "Edge of Seventeen not only captures Eric's painful struggle of sexual identity, but it's also a swell time capsule of musical and fashion rebellion in the Reagan era.",
            "More than anything, the movie is a collection of moments that feel so real.",

            "This relationship could have been cliched - and there are cliches throughout the film - but McVay and Stafford Keep it real.",
            "[T]he film's ending in that disco is a bit too patly upbeat. But these are minor flaws in a movie that captures a small slice of 1980's middle-class Middle-American life just about perfectly.",
            "As well-intentioned as it may be, \"Edge of Seventeen\" is filled with cliched dialogue, stereotypical characterizations and predictable plotting.",
            "My hope for Eric is not merely that he grows comfortable with his sexuality, but that he becomes a more interesting conversationalist, hopefully before I see him in another movie.",
            "A more seasoned director could blend all those moods and objectives, but Moreton seems to stop and start each time he shifts moods.",
            "It takes its tone of mournful defiance from Bronski Beat's \"Smalltown Boy,\" that great, quavery ode to the pain of liberation."

            "Problematically, Birth of a Nation wasn't just a seminal commercial spectacle but also a decisively original work of art -- in effect, the founding work of cinematic realism, albeit a work that was developed to pass lies off as reality.",
            "The quasi-Victorian Griffith was in so many respects way ahead of his time even if his philosophy and mind-set could often be said to be behind it.",
            "The Birth of a Nation has become a staple of any film studies course, for its excellent performances, thrilling action sequences and epic landscapes. However it's subject matter is much more controversial now.",
            "Birth of a Nation is a great epoch in picture making; it's great for pictures and it's great for the name and fame of David Wark Griffith. When a man like Griffith in a new field can do what he has done, he may as well be hailed while he is living.",
            "Griffith's later films are unquestionably superior. But here, in a very real sense, is where the movies began, both as an art and as a business.",
            "The civil war battle pictures, taken in panorama, represent enormous effort and achieve a striking degree of success.",
            "More prominent than the adventuresome Civil War reenactments or the educational historical retellings (the ones based on actual records) are the fictional love stories.",
            "D.W. Griffith made many other films with old-fashioned, sentimental storylines -- but his best work moves the audience, because it is based on an emotional truth. That emotional truth is missing in this film. ",
            "A film that deserves, no demands, to be acknowledged, if for no other reason than to come to terms with the racist history it represents.",
            "While it's clear that D.W. Griffith's The Birth Of A Nation is a seminal work of narrative filmmaking and will forever live in infamy as a result (being seen by new eyes generation after generation) that doesn't mean one can't wish it were never made.",
            "As a work of art, it is unforgettable; as a social document, it is unforgivable. Quality of Movie: 4 stars. Content of Movie: 1 star.",
            "D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation is as much a part of film history as the Civil War is a part of American history. ",
            "A towering milestone in the history of cinema. Asentimentalised, reactionary slab of racism. Can a film be both? In the case of D.W. Griffith's silent-era classic The Birth Of A Nation, unfortunately it can.",
            "This is an impressive spectacle, rightfully lauded for its myriad innovations. But the sentiments it expresses are pretty damn ugly.",
            "It's hard to applaud a film where the Ku Klux Klan rides triumphantly to the rescue, and this, alas, undoes all the sterling work put in earlier and the wonderful performances from Lillian Gish, Mae Marsh, Henry B Walthall and especially Robert Harron.",
            "Links the divide between American past and American present.",
            "a masterpiece that still packs a punch and whose standard-bearing genius remains untarnished.",
            "What does it say about a country that one of its greatest films is also one of the most bigoted movies ever made? ... If you can ignore the actors in blackface and the vicious stereotypes, Griffith's folly is also a triumph of silent film technique.",
            "Like it or not, its tremendous influence can't be denied.",
            "The biggest challenge the film provided for its audiences is perhaps to decide when 'ground-breaking, dedicated, serious cinematic art' must be reviled as politically reprehensible.",
            "Racist yet an incredibly important landmark film.",
            "shocks audiences with its blatant racism yet remains one of the defining films of the silent era."

            "Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is just the sort of goofy fun that the title implies.",
            "The biggest problem with the movie is that the very delicately crafted PG-13 level blood and gore keeps things from really becoming interesting. ",

            "The romance is heartless, the plot is brainless, and the action is gutless - Pride and Prejudice and Zombies survives purely on its spine.",
            "It's silly but also creative and doesn't take itself too seriously.",
            "An excruciatingly long and tepid 107 minutes, a hollow pastiche of both the costume drama and the zombie movie. ",
            "The inclusion of zombies doesn't make it a kick-ass tale of love and is ultimately a disappointing new take on Jane Austen's novel.",
            "It's silly and over the top, for sure, but I really, really liked it. Also, even if you've read the book there will still be some surprises! ",
            " There's a balance to be struck between respecting the integrity of Pride and Prejudice while having fun with the wacky experiment of throwing zombies into the mix, and Steers' attempt is decidedly wobbly. ",

            "The emotional impact of the film lies in its raw, documentary feel and the natural performances of Johns and Squires; the dialogue is akin to eavesdropping on real conversations.",

            "One can sympathise with Loach's political sensibilities, but this film's shallowness, twee sensibility and transparent polemics make for an unchallenging viewing experience. ",
            "Ken Loach gives you just enough in the 100 minutes running time and this film will captivate and disgust the viewer in equal measure.",
            "There is something thrilling about Loach's dedication to exposing the horror and mind-numbing pointlessness of bureaucracy with as little drama as possible.",
            "Loach, then, is still the best at what he does - speaking the truth to power on behalf of those whose voices are so often unheard. And he can still appeal to the head as much as the heart.",
            "Worthy of its Palme D'Or win at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival.",
            "When I first saw British director's \"I, Daniel Blake\"... I found its tale of an unemployed man's struggle extremely moving but a bit heavy-handed. After the election, that excess now seems like righteous, well-placed anger.",
            "It's impossible to watch this movie without being forced to cope with bouts of sadness and helplessness -- it's honest and uncompromising, although moments of humor do manage to break loose.",
            "[Ken] Loach is British cinema's Charles Dickens - a humanist who deserves to be long remembered for holding up a mirror to society with compelling stories and indelible characters.",
            "... confronts that reality and those characters from an angle that allows them to become a kind of mirror held up before Britain - a mirror showing images that are ominously critical, yet crystalline in their humanity."

            "Piffle, really, with guitars.",
            "Sing Street, while not telling a tale that could be labeled as anything close to original, still crackles with an innovative vitality all its own, making its climactic leaps into the starry-eyed unknown all the more wonderful because of this.",
            "Sing Street takes its inspiration from the music and movies of the '80s, tapping into nostalgia for the time with its messages about self-expression.",
            "Sing Street is a pleasing, heart-warming journey with a tight screenplay and a strong soundtrack.",
            "Sing Street is a shaggy, uneven, but undeniably endearing and entertaining film, especially if this was the music of your childhood, as it was mine.",
            "If anything, it's even better than The Commitments because it doesn't go in for the slick manipulation associated with that film's director, Alan Parker.",
            "Sing Street is a charming little love story, with fun songs, both originals and New Wave classics from the period. It will make its way into your heart and probably stay there for a while",
            "We are facing a delicious comedy that uses music as the heartbeat of a heart in love to seduce us with its apparent melodious romanticism. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Writer/Director John Carney has another winner here. ",
            "Sing Street should be watched at full volume and with an open heart.",
            "Yes, the drama can feel a bit contrived. But it's delivered and packaged in such an entertaining way with memorable characters. It easily lands amongst the best films of the year for me.",
            "Carney and company make songs in loads of different 1980s genres, and all work perfectly. Combine that with a few nice, softer moments and a literal \"fist-pumping\" ending, and you have a film that's hard to dislike, even if it could stand more harmony.",
            "I loved the music!",
            "Sing Street is a touching and toe-tapping delight from start to finish.",
            "[Director John Carney]... has imagined something like Super 8, but with music instead of movies, much more spontaneous and uninhibited, a hundred times more authentic. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "It's glam, it's sweet and it has a killer soundtrack.",
            "Middling film that relies heavily on 1980s nostalgia-and unfortunately, the racist and male-centric tropes of that decade as well.",
            "...absolutely delightful, a coming-of-age story filled with catchy 1980s pop music and wonderfully charming and romantic performances. ",
            "The crafty and colorful Sing Street could be perceived as the junior-sized extension of the aforementioned \"Once\" where lyrics and love methodically come together in unison.",
            "John Carney's retro-feelgood mash-up, Sing Street, is elevated by its sheer charm and the way it taps into a fundamental truth about the sentiment of teenage yearning. ",
            "A magnificent coming of age film from John Carney perfectly connects music to beauty of life.",
            "Carney nails the tone of the film and everything from the costumes, to the dialogue and music will have you leaving the theater feeling uplifted and tapping your feet. ",
            "A glowing youth fantasy surrounded by the increasing pressures of real life, Carney's musical is caught between the wonder of adolescent discovery and cynical adulthood. ",
            "Nothing startling here, but a likeable young cast and an irresistible vibe."

            "Not just a dull but an oppressive experience, being force-fed a corporate product: a film that never comes alive, with none of the characters properly developed, none of the relationships gelling, the very adventure formulaic.",

            "The film is fun, it's enjoyable, it was exciting at times even, but something felt like it was missing or off.",
            "Rogue One is muscular blockbuster filmmaking that also has a heart and an ethical code.",
            "Unlike any other franchise, a new Star Wars movie can be considered a life event (I can pinpoint where I saw each one of the prequels and Episode VII). Make it a special one, the movie does its part.",

            "For every clich\u00e9 the film indulges, another is skirted, and another subverted. By the end, every ounce of feelgood is deserved.",

            "Even at its most exhilarating, it never loses its restraint. It works wonderfully well both as a human drama and a sports film.",
            "Subtlety isn't Queen of Katwe's strongest suit, but it has a big, magnificent heart that most audience's are going to deeply enjoy being near.",
            "The acting is top notch: Nalwanga is a fresh presence and is well supported by Oyewolo and Lupita Nyong'o, who despite not looking as someone who had two teenage daughters, makes the role believable out of sheer force.",
            "Overall, Queen of Katwe is in many ways, classic Disney - uplifting and beautiful to watch with an engaging female protagonist at its core. What makes it all the more amazing is its talented cast.",
            "Both Nyong'o and Oyelowo are fully capable of bringing the intensity and authenticity to their roles representing inspiring real-life characters, and once again show why they are two of the top actors being hired today.",
            "There's a distinct burden to telling a true story well - and this cast and crew shouldered the task bravely.",
            "Director Mira Nair has done a wonderful job taking the inspirational movie formula and creating something special.",
            "Perhaps it's slightly formulaic, but as it's how the real events unfolded it's all the more touching and triumphant.",
            "Mira Nair brings her characteristic fluid flair, vibrant colour and joyous use of music to the dramatisation of the true story of Phiona Mutesi.",
            "The ending slightly fizzles, but director Mira Nair's sure, guiding hand, her excellent cast, and the power of the story itself never fails to inspire.",
            "While some might consider chess a bit of a stretch when it comes to being a sport, the film's infectious charm can't be denied.",
            "...somehow makes watching middle schoolers play competitive chess feel exhilarating...",
            "This is an inspirational film about perseverance.",

            "While following a familiar formula, its fearlessness of telling a story told in a new perception makes this a worthwhile viewing for anyone wanting some inspiration.",
            "Mira Nair's picture is too long, but you can forgive such an inspiring tale a lot, especially when it is so clear-eyed about poverty in modern Africa. Be sure to stick around for the end credits.",
            "\"Queen of Katwe\" is spirited and uplifting. Lupita Nyong'o and David Oyelowo, especially, put in great performances. The film explores some serious issues like poverty, but manages to maintain heart throughout. ",
            "Director Nair shows more than her skill, which is impressive. It's the love for the country and Phiona's story that sets the film apart. Visually it's rich. [It's] structure is solid with a few twists that separates it from superficially similar movies."

            "A set of solid performances power this underdog flick to victory.",
            "Even at its most exhilarating, it never loses its restraint. It works wonderfully well both as a human drama and a sports film.",
            "Subtlety isn't Queen of Katwe's strongest suit, but it has a big, magnificent heart that most audience's are going to deeply enjoy being near.",
            "The acting is top notch: Nalwanga is a fresh presence and is well supported by Oyewolo and Lupita Nyong'o, who despite not looking as someone who had two teenage daughters, makes the role believable out of sheer force.",
            "Overall, Queen of Katwe is in many ways, classic Disney - uplifting and beautiful to watch with an engaging female protagonist at its core. What makes it all the more amazing is its talented cast.",
            "Both Nyong'o and Oyelowo are fully capable of bringing the intensity and authenticity to their roles representing inspiring real-life characters, and once again show why they are two of the top actors being hired today.",
            "There's a distinct burden to telling a true story well - and this cast and crew shouldered the task bravely.",
            "Director Mira Nair has done a wonderful job taking the inspirational movie formula and creating something special.",
            "Perhaps it's slightly formulaic, but as it's how the real events unfolded it's all the more touching and triumphant.",
            "Mira Nair brings her characteristic fluid flair, vibrant colour and joyous use of music to the dramatisation of the true story of Phiona Mutesi.",
            "The ending slightly fizzles, but director Mira Nair's sure, guiding hand, her excellent cast, and the power of the story itself never fails to inspire.",
            "While some might consider chess a bit of a stretch when it comes to being a sport, the film's infectious charm can't be denied.",
            "...somehow makes watching middle schoolers play competitive chess feel exhilarating...",
            "This is an inspirational film about perseverance.",
            "And although the film feels strongly familiar in pathos and promise it is still a capable message movie about disenfranchised youngsters that overcome their desperately humble beginnings in the face of unflattering odds.",
            "While following a familiar formula, its fearlessness of telling a story told in a new perception makes this a worthwhile viewing for anyone wanting some inspiration.",
            "Mira Nair's picture is too long, but you can forgive such an inspiring tale a lot, especially when it is so clear-eyed about poverty in modern Africa. Be sure to stick around for the end credits.",
            "\"Queen of Katwe\" is spirited and uplifting. Lupita Nyong'o and David Oyelowo, especially, put in great performances. The film explores some serious issues like poverty, but manages to maintain heart throughout. ",
            "Director Nair shows more than her skill, which is impressive. It's the love for the country and Phiona's story that sets the film apart. Visually it's rich. [It's] structure is solid with a few twists that separates it from superficially similar movies."

            "No music mockumentary can resist comparison with This Is Spinal Tap (and no review can resist making it) but Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping does a pretty fantastic job of updating the expectations, the personalities and the music to today.",

            "Paterson is the best film of 2016.",

            "This film is pleasant enough, but there were definitely elements that left a sour taste in my mouth. I fear that this cinema experience is going to prove forgettable, as the film was ultimately paper-thin and liable to fly away on a desert wind.",
            "...the film doesn't peter out completely, but by going down a dry, humourless \"we're-all-the-same-really-kiss-me-quick\" route, A HOLOGRAM FOR THE KING arguably ends up a facsimile of superior films. Or a faint hologram even.",

            "Compelling source material joins with a terrific performance from Tom Hanks in this film that manages a nice scale.",
            "While the film definitely flails at times, it rides on the charisma of its three central performances that each link up in a way that's surprisingly organic.",
            "I'd advise skipping the novel and going straight to the theater. The film will take up far less time, and will be a much more enjoyable experience.",
            "The fact that they were able to make a comedy out of it shows just how hard they worked on this project.",
            "The result may mostly be a shaggy-dog story, but it's a pleasing one that leaves the viewer with the feeling that humanity may yet be able to rise above its sectarian divisions.",

            "Miss Sloane has a narrative momentum that is hard to wholly resist. It's absurd. But it's never boring.",
            "Hard to root for but mesmerising to watch, Sloane is expertly portrayed by Chastain in this dialogue-heavy lobbyist thriller that should please fans of both actor and genre.",
            "It's a towering, armour-plated performance.",
            "Elizabeth Sloane's a real piece of work - and so is this film.",
            "The film's unwillingness to engage in any meaningful sense with the issues it purports to raise feels like an opportunity squandered.",
            "[A] slickly accomplished thriller about the lobbying industry in Washington.",
            "...the film's depiction of greed and malfeasance in the political arena, sharp and grim as it is, is largely superficial and falls far short of a much more advanced and dangerous reality.",
            "Perera's script trips on its own feet over and over again, deriving into use of complex language, excessive dialogue and pretentious jokes. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "The fuel that jet propels the movie throughout is Chastain, who gives her best performance since Zero Dark Thirty.",
            "If there's a reason to see this movie, it's [Jessica] Chastain, but you knew that. ",
            "Everything that makes it shine rests on Jessica Chastain's shoulders.",
            "Director John Madden has crafted a stylish drama but hasn't imbued it with the depth that could have made the film more intriguing.",
            "It's too long and falls far short of the quality it thinks it contains, but Miss Sloane is always an engaging watch. Its strongest asset? The ferocious, outstanding, inimitable Jessica Chastain.",
            "Miss Sloane isn't a bad movie. In fact, it's pretty good. It just isn't quite good enough to reach the ambitious heights to which it so transparently aspires. ",
            "Miss Sloane is a well-played political chess game.",
            "Miss Sloane is more interested in pure wish fulfillment at its conclusion than embracing the ethical ambiguity that its character has demonstrated since the opening scenes.",
            "Provides enough twists and turns with a smart screenplay by Perera and a strong performance Chastain to make it a good recommendation. ",
            "Miss Sloane could have been an important film with high entertainment value, but instead it's just a pretty good bit of entertainment with some mildly interesting subtext that should be text.",
            "With a brilliant ensemble cast, featuring solid performances by Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Mark Strong, a fast-paced but coherent structure, and direction that sustains interest from beginning to end, Miss Sloane is an unqualified success.",
            "Alas, the script turns out to be more melodramatic TV movie than Michael Clayton, and life at a lobby firm, all that sitting around conference tables, does not make for thrilling cinematic viewing.",
            "Miss Sloane might feel like a therapeutic respite of rage. It's a brazenly pulpy and vengeful look at K Street combat that lobs a grenade directly under the rotten foundation of status quo governance.",
            "A serviceable political drama carried by its strong cast performances and undone by its attempt to do too much.",
            "\"Miss Sloane\" is a film and a character that isn't just one step ahead of you, it's lapping you around the running track like Captain America at the beginning of \"The Winter Soldier.\"",
            "There's little doubt that the success of John Madden's latest film, Miss Sloane, lays in the blisteringly chilly performance from Jessica Chastain."

            "The first \"Independence Day\" had the gratifying slap of good pop cinema, harmless and weightless; the follow-up is twice as big and half as fun.",
            "The temptation is there to say that Independence Day: Resurgence tarnishes the image of its predecessor but the original Independence Day wasn't all that good to begin with.",
            "It's a non-movie, an insult to the blockbuster genre, and should stand only as a perfect example of Hollywood's more glaring deficiencies as an industry. ",
            "Disposable and shockingly inept.",
            "Well that was unnecessary.",
            "Resurgence is a movie that tries too hard to recapture the natural aspects of it's predecessor while trying to introduce new plot elements that you hope that can be figured out in future movies.",
            "As absurd as it is stupid, Independence Day: Resurgence is a movie that will go down as a reviled and needless. But it's also goofy and has the sense of a small, petulant child banging his toys together in a sandbox, which is amusing.",
            "A fun time to disconnect your brain. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "This was even dumber, if possible.",

            "ndependence Day: Resurgence is expectedly dumb but surprisingly ugly, with computer-generated chaos replacing anything resembling comprehendible action. Apparently, it took five writers to come up with \"but what if everything was bigger?\"",
            "If you own the first Independence Day, I suggest buying this one so you have both in your collection, but, as a stand-alone, it doesn't excite as much as the original.",
            "There are so many awesome things in this movie, but they're executed so poorly that you love them and you hate them at the same time.",
            "Like a blockbuster machine, Emmerich spits out explosions and poor dialogue at his most absurd rate yet.",
            "It really feels like nobody even tried to make a good movie.",
            "Watch it for the VFX and for a few good light-hearted moments that will make the movie more real. Watch this one for the whole 20-years-ago-and-now nostalgia.",
            "Proves to be nothing more than a lazy attempt to recapture the magic of the original. It comes off as a second-rate rip-off that lacks any of the fun or imagination as its predecessor.",
            "It all becomes a little bit much after awhile. ",
            "Independence Day: Resurgence is an outdated product stuck in a decade that we've long since moved past.",

            "Mills is clearly fond of all these characters, and is happy to dwell on their moments of happiness and sadness, all of which provide knowledge and worldly wisdom to the teenage boy whose life they will so profoundly affect.",
            "It's a nice film with some great moments but Mills' touch is too tentative to make all that talk buzz and hum as resonantly as it should.",
            "We finally have a good film that explores what it looks like to raise a male feminist, particularly during this crucial era. More importantly, we finally have a film that actually cares to do so (shout out to writer/director Mike Mills).",
            "There are louder films jostling for attention out there. This one is the secret treasure of the season, though - crafted with tender precision, and built to last.",
            "There's a certain arch self-awareness in the screenwriting that won't appeal to everyone, but I loved the film for its scrapbook structure, its warmth and candour.",
            "Too often, one yearns for the simple organising principles of three-act structure and boring linear storytelling.",
            "I think the messages not only transcend the time period but also the particulars of individual relationships. There is a bit of all our familial relationships somewhere in these characters...",
            "With all due respect, given the overall banality of 20th Century Women, why does Mills continue to think his life will be so fascinating to the rest of us?",
            "A fabulous homage, specifically to Mills' mom, but also to any woman and her true family about what to value, and when not to shut up when bullies threaten.",
            "It feels passive-aggressively preachy, vague in its lessons, and overwritten to the point where I was genuinely dreading every moment Bening was gearing up to speak. ",
            "There are so many small tidbits about life, love, and happiness in 20th Century Women that it feels like therapy.",
            "Mills, to his credit, creates realistic scenarios with natural dialogue, but this also happens to make the movie, well, very boring.",
            "What did it mean to be born, to grow up in, to die in, the 20th century? Well, it meant a lot of different things.",
            "This is not a great movie, but it is another one of [Annette] Bening's great performances. ",
            "20th Century Women is a sun-drenched search for wisdom in changing times that's no less relevant today than it was when Jimmy Carter gave his \"Crisis of Conscience\" speech.",
            "Whether it's discussions about how questioning one's happiness is a shortcut to depression or having your heart broken to learn about the world, 20TH CENTURY WOMEN is a film that informs, educates, and entertains.",
            "20th Century Women might not follow usual conventions, or tie up all its loose ends neatly, but it still manages a coherent, brilliantly witty story. One that satisfies its audience far more than similar films with happier endings.",
            "When people lament the loss of mid-budget films celebrating real people, they should hold this film up as a champion of the type of story that is both small and universal, where nothing and everything happens.",
            "20th Century Women is one of the finest films of the year, unceremoniously buried in an awards season full of biopics and more overtly emotive dramas.",

            "[Southside with you] should make stars of [Parker] Sawyers and [Tika] Sumpter.",
            "A truly horrible TV movie premise -- let's re-create the first romantic date between Barack and Michelle Obama -- is given serious intellectual and emotional heft in the writer-director Richard Tanne's feature debut",
            "As a multi-faceted character study - of a couple, a nation, a racial identity - there are surprises around every corner.",
            "A gently likable, Linklaterish movie that ideologically conflates romantic excitement with progressive idealism, bringing in some unexpected subtleties.",
            "Stumbles occasionally, but still manages to cast a hushed spell that never entirely fades.",
            "A small, successful sketch of now-great lives.",
            "Southside With You is a beautifully shot, engaging, and warm tale of two young people on the cusp of, well, everything. ",
            "It's the sort of happy ending that makes the story of their first steps towards each other all the more compelling to watch unfold.",
            "Enamors and enchants you often to forget that the two main characters are the future President and First Lady of the United States of America.",
            "Southside With You is a warm little film, a sweet parting gift to the President and his First Lady and to the country as his era comes to a close.",
            "If you are looking for a date movie this would be a good choice.",
            "An engrossing walk-and-talk biodrama that tips its hat to Richard Linklater's BEFORE trilogy while also breathing humanity into two iconic figures.",
            "A charming imagined dramatisation of how the Obamas became the Obamas is sweet, warm, clever and suffused in a golden glow.",
            "Much like the smooth-talking man who would become President, Southside makes balancing many expectations look easy. Topics such as race, class, and especially gender, are touched upon with amazing ease.",
            "First there was the rom-com. Then the zom-rom-com. Now we have the world's first obam-rom-com. ",
            "There's a pleasant texture to the visuals of Southside With You, a soft visual style that compliments the two stellar leads.",
            "Southside With You is a rare love story. One that doesn't put on rose tinted glasses and magic moments. Instead, the film focuses on real, obtainable love.",
            "It's sweet and honest in its simplicity, and despite an ultra-low budget that can barely mask that the events aren't actually taking place in the late 80s, Tanne still manages something softly entrancing.",
            "\"Southside With You\" is a sweet, romantic film, but one that is layered with intelligence, relationship, and character building. It's an engaging re-imagining of the Obamas' first date.",
            "Southside With You is a lovely notion, a celebratory biography, and a slightly presumptuous memorial all wrapped up in a dreamy romantic date movie.",
            "I feel bad for anyone who would avoid it on the basis of political considerations.",

            "Cotillard's emotional energy is wasted in Garcia's capably directed romantic drama, which is visually polished by Christophe Beaucarne, though his glossy frames actually create an accidental desolation in the film's jagged void of unlikely drama.",

            "The mistakes of From the Land of the Moon are wide-ranging, but they all start with a character who's not worth our time.",
            "Instead of any meaningful exploration of mental illness, the film exploits the affliction of its protagonist for a meandering romantic melodrama with an unconvincing final-act twist.",

            "Director Nicole Garcia creates a romantic drama that at times falls back on clich\u00e9s, but also covers new ground with a love-it-or-hate-it unexpected ending.",
            "Another French examination of l'amour fou, this one verging on risibility with its excessive devotion to the excessiveness of its heroine.",
            "Cotillard's madwoman contortions cannot pass for innocent adolescent pique, and this exposes the film's fakery...with sidelong references to imperialism and immigration, the film becomes increasingly absurd and indulgent.",

            "Kendrick and Timberlake bring snappy comic timing, even when the dialogue could be wittier. Co-director Walt Dohrn steals the picture as a high-fiving cloud-bro.",
            "I was confident Nicholas Stoller's Storks would take the prize for most obnoxious family entertainment of the year, but Trolls -- another garish, computer-animated comedy -- instantly lowers the bar.",
            "I didn't like it, not at all, and while I'm certain there are kids out there who will undoubtedly feel differently don't expect me to sing a different tune on the matter anytime soon.",
            "One character farts glitter and another poops cupcakes. You could not ask for better in-movie metaphors.",
            "It's reasonably entertaining, with some good musical numbers and at least one goofily endearing performance. But it's also just a little bit all over the place, with a story that often seems like a fairy-tale greatest hits album.",
            "Despite the tiresome story, it's a hard film to dislike.",
            "There's no denying that kids will likely eat this up, dance in the aisles, and have a good time out, but I'm guessing there will be a sizable number of adults in close proximity tapping their toes and smiling right along with them. ",
            "It's gloriously colourful, simultaneously silly yet often deceptively clever, and actually rather enchanting. ",
            " Trolls' animation is fantastic with color hues that are vibrant and full and run the entire spectrum.",
            "The toe-tapping tunes are a real highlight.",
            "Trolls is fun for the whole family from beginning to end! I dare you not to sing and dance along.",
            "A little too light and pedestrian to be a classic, Trolls nevertheless sets up a fun universe for its characters and audience.",
            "Well, it's not awful but it is very uneven.",
            "\"Trolls\" warmed even my crusty, oozing black heart. Yes it's rainbow fluff with unicorns and glitter on top but it's a ton of fun with a soundtrack of established songs that even the most old fashioned parent should know.",
            "I was instantly enthralled with the look, story, and performances within the film.",
            "It turns into so many different movies that it doesn't know then what it actually wants to be by the end of it.",
            "DreamWorks Animation's trolls, with their candy-vomit hair and bizarre designs, scream originality.",
            "Though it comes with a heavy reliance on Cinderella for a plot, it's fun, silly, and busy. You will need a high tolerance for disco, though.",
            "\"Trolls\" is a perfect escapism movie suited for the entire family. It's a vibrant, colorful and rich display of human emotion that will resonate with everyone.",
            "The creators of Shrek thus compose an addictive musical remix of adorable characters, hilarious and emotional moments, catchy songs, colorful aesthetics... [Full review in Spanish]",
            "It feels like the entire movie is told from bits and pieces of an unearthed scrapbook from the '80s, with town and forests seemingly crafted from cardboard and felt paper and a soundtrack curated out of a list of favorite songs. ",
            "What's weird is that the things that I liked about it are the things I usually hate about these types of movies. This movie does pop culture references, cover songs...but for some reason, in this movie, it works. ",
            "Trolls is a fail-safe film that young parents can take their kids to, and hopefully enjoy a few chuckles themselves.",
            " This animated film is like mainlining a rainbow, snorting Martha Stewart-brand glitter and drinking a glass of ecstasy-spiked champagne. You'll get a high off all the happy."

            "Romantic comedies that feature pregnancy as a dramatic motor are unanimously, and without exception, awful... Yet, here comes the writer-director Rebecca Miller, with her big brain and literary pedigree, and she completely nails it.",
            "Although droll rather than laugh-out-loud funny, this is a smart and immensely enjoyable romcom.",
            "[Miller] continues to write and direct smart, funny, surprising movies at a time when those are not quite wanted at major studios. She attracts superb actors, probably because the roles are always meaty, even the small ones.",
            "It comes as a surprise to relate that [Miller's] most successful film yet is also her most conventional. ",
            "While Maggie's Plan lacks the deftly combustible elements that fuel [Rebecca] Miller's top-drawer work, it's worth catching for Gerwig, who's a true original.",
            " Miller wraps the whole complex, tragicomic affair up in a brisk 98 minutes, which should serve as an example to the directors of the bloated tentpoles propping up the major studios.",

            "Gerwig is the perfect choice for the material, an actress who conveys a wittiness that always seems like she is one or two steps ahead of everyone else in the room -- even when she is one or two steps behind.",
            "Rebecca Miller's film feels a lot like a Woody Allen film; great, jazzy score, deeply felt New York inhabitants and a quick wit from a smart and funny script.",
            "A quick but powerful look into relationships between well-written, well-executed characters.",
            "Maggie's Plan is a comedy drama of Brooklyn manners you will either find delightful (if you enjoy gabby pictures and Gerwig) or monstrously irritating. Four stars gives my position away.",
            "[Maggie's Plan is] plainly shot, casually paced and at times horribly repetitive.",
            "It works as a screwball comedy if you're willing to embrace its strange, but strong charm, as well as its ridiculous scheming later on in the movie. It gets a bit awkward, but the actors' banter at least saves it.",
            "At its core, Maggie's Plan is an unconventional romantic comedy that also serves as a dose of therapy for those who may be feeling at a crossroads in their own personal lives.",
            "Even if Maggie's Plan is not a great comedy, it is a work of intelligence that succeeded in surprising me, especially after Miller's earlier films.",
            "I can't express how satisfied I am that Maggie's Plan probably lacked the budget for a bigger name. The part and the actress are ideally suited for each other. Greta Gerwig deserves greater success.",
            "Gerwig and Hawke spar well, Miller's screenplay has some lovely lines and there are cracking supporting performances from the likes of Julianne Moore and Bill Hader.",
            "It's a movie that you probably won't remember much of in a year, but that you will happily re-watch on cable. ",
            "[Julianne] Moore is the centerpiece here, both comic and emotional, a nifty transition guided by [Rebecca] Miller with deft, forgiving aplomb."

            "The buoyant, bittersweet \"Wedding\" puts new fizz in an old form.",
            "Although [Hogan] stages most of the scenes in a straightforward way for Friend's Wedding, there are some charming, offbeat touches here. One wishes he'd mined some of the story's kinkier subtexts a bit more, but hey ... this is a commercial-minded flick.",
            "A bittersweet, modern-love morsel, this scrumptious drama should touch moviegoers' hearts in this action gorged summer.",
            "We don't feel much of anything.",
            "The draggy narrative of this 1997 comedy is tough to sit through -- there are even several overproduced musical numbers -- but it does have an intriguing subversive element that I don't want to give away.",
            "Anchored by skilled comedienne Julia Roberts, this skewered variation on jealousy and the wrong woman doing battle in the aisles is a winning balance of the familiar and the novel.",
            "A poor imitation of a screwball comedy.",
            "Hogan's follow-up to Muriel's Wedding rolls smoothly over the bumps in the plot, oiled by a witty acerbic script and strong central performances.",
            "This amiable comedy may not be hugely sophisticated, but Hogan does manage to make his attractive leads look like complete idiots, no mean achievement in image-obsessed Hollywood.",
            "The Roberts audiences knew and loved is back--not only has the smile returned, but also the glow, the joy of performance.",
            "For those of us not so enthralled with Ms. Roberts, you'll have to endure the movie, but will be mildly entertained with good, old music and some stellar comedy provided almost entirely by Rupert Everett.",
            "A romantic comedy that is both mawkish and subversive.",
            "The film's brazen amorality gradually freezes the smile on your face.",
            "A cheeky comedy that rates at least three bouquets.",
            "A romantic comedy significantly darker, more realistic and more intelligent than Hollywood examples of the same genre.",
            "This delightful comedy about love, friendship and the hazards of lying comes not a moment too soon for anyone overwhelmed by the current glut of summer movie mayhem.",
            "[The film's] virtues...make such a vivid and appealing impression that we forget, ignore, or fail even to notice those elements that are less successful.",
            "Not only does this modern-day screwball romp manage to be romantic and comical, it also offers Julia Roberts a chance to shine again in the kind of movie that she does best.",
            "Hey, I actually really liked this picture.",
            "A misbegotten attempt to update the genre that only proves the enduring -- if not downright inviolable -- appeal of the boy-meets-girl scenario.",
            "[Julia Roberts] is at her vibrant best.",
            "There are many humorous moments throughout, though some of the more outrageous segments seem too contrivedly wacky.",
            "My Best Friend's Wedding is a well-paced fun flick that women will enjoy and men will too if they are on a date."

            "In all, this is a film which because of its conception and technical achievements demands to he seen and deserves careful and discriminating attention.",

            "\"Beyond\" is undoubtedly messy, like a Starfleet ship that's taken its fair share of beatings, but it is frequently a reminder of how good the series can be when all its engines are in working order.",
            "It does seem strange that a franchise whose original appeal was futuristic should now be treasured entirely as faithfully retrospective. But there it is.",
            "Star Trek Beyond also serves as a fitting and respectful end for these group of characters. Just like what Skyfall did for James Bond on their 50th anniversary, this is the real start of the adventures of the Starship Enterprise.",
            "It...has a very classic \"Trek\" feel...It has excitement and humor, introduces us to several new alien species and has a terrific mean and scary villain. Everything a good Star Trek story needs.",
            "Maybe the rebooted franchise has more left in the tank than we thought.",
            "The film may not go beyond what we've already seen, but as a sci-fi piece of entertainment, it knows when to use the Star Trek formula to deliver scenes that are sometimes surprising. [Full review in Spanish]",

            "I found it really campy and silly and fun.",
            "The newest entry in the franchise, Star Trek Beyond, may lack some of the stately grandeur of OG Trek, but it's got optimism in spades.",
            "Star Trek Beyond carries Roddenberry's conviction that we can solve our problems by sticking together and applying equal parts compassion and logic, and its optimism is catchy.",
            "This is an action-packed film with massive destruction, and interesting relationships, plus some good comedy and positive messages. ",
            "Despite the action-heavy delivery, the beating heart of the series remained intact, thanks largely to the cast and their chemistry and charisma.",
            "As for the main plot and action, I think that it is visually one of the most interesting and impressive of the series so far. ",
            "This is the most truly \"Star Trek\"-esque installment of the new series, albeit one that retains enough CGI \"kerpow and kaboom\" to Rodden your Berries.",
            "Most importantly it was a film about characters, which has always been the most important part of Star Trek.",
            "A welcome refresh that again grounds the series in the spirit of idealism and optimism that were at the forefront of creator Gene Roddenberry's thinking, and which have no expiration date.",
            "2009's eponymous uncorking of this rejuvenated series remains far more satisfying than the two glasses that have followed, but Beyond hints the best might yet be still to come.",
            "While the hardcore Trekkers might still take issue, they're likely to enjoy it more than the previous installment. And for those who are simply fans of sci-fi action, well they're in for a treat.",

            "As far as directorial debuts go, there are few this delightfully strange, that take the highest, most ridiculous concept imaginable and bring it back down to earth kicking and screaming.",

            "The only thing wrong with this gorgeously shot, singularly crafted film is its ending. And given the premise of Swiss Army Man, this was always going to be a challenge."

            "All this is done with an impish, flag-waving sense of fun, even though Moore is making some hard-hitting points.",

            "Where to Invade Next is worth a look, for its small revelations. I mean, even if you've heard that kids in French state schools eat better food than our kids, actually seeing them eat scallops in fish broth is one of the film's truly eloquent moments.",

            "While Everybody Wants Some!! isn't a great movie, there is something comforting about its predictability, self-awareness, and ability to basically recapture the plot of every single end-of-school-year/beginning-of-school-year teen/early 20s storyline.",
            "The movie respects its audience in a way few of these coming-of-age comedies ever do, and while not a home run for Linklater, it's still a solid triple off the wall I'm certain to still be cheering for throughout the remainder of 2016.",
            "There's no storyline. The script just drifts from one vignette to the next as the boys cruise around, ogling girls, haunting the campus night spots and staging a party while their house does its best to remain standing under their assaults.",
            "Despite its easygoing spirit, Everybody is tightly structured, framed by four parties and a countdown clock to the start of classes. For a movie that's pretty much about nothing, it's incredibly well-paced and never overstays its welcome.",
            "It's as if Linklater is bound by a bro code that obliges him to present these guys in a basically uncritical light.",

            "Sigh. I loved this film.",
            "Linklater presents more of an indictment of nostalgia than a tribute at its alter, moments to be celebrated without needing to long for their return.",

            "It's a coming of age story, a love letter to a bygone era, and a reclamation of adolescent masculinity from a cruel grasp of \"bro\" culture. It's also a damn fine comedy.",
            "It's funny as hell. It's precisely the right amount of raunchy. It's got a darn good soundtrack. It's a further study of time from a filmmaker eternally fascinated by the subject.",
            "It's all pleasant enough, but after the triumph of 2014's Boyhood, it kind of feels like Linklater's phoning it in on this one.",
            "It's this giddy whimsy that makes Everybody Wants Some!! so damned likable.",
            "It's so much deeper than the beer and bong water it's steeped in.",

            "Subtle as a baseball to the head, Boyhood's successor can be as insufferable as its heinously punctuated title...",
            "EVERYBODY WANTS SOME!! may lack the subtlety and richness of Linklater's best work, but it remains an incredibly exhilarating film that will leave you with warm feelings of nostalgia.",
            "Living with Linklater's characters as they explore life, unsupervised, without inhibition, engages the heart and takes you back to a freewheeling, optimistic state of mind and body that many of us let go of a long time ago. "

            "It's a coming of age story, a love letter to a bygone era, and a reclamation of adolescent masculinity from a cruel grasp of \"bro\" culture. It's also a damn fine comedy.",
            "It's funny as hell. It's precisely the right amount of raunchy. It's got a darn good soundtrack. It's a further study of time from a filmmaker eternally fascinated by the subject.",
            "It's all pleasant enough, but after the triumph of 2014's Boyhood, it kind of feels like Linklater's phoning it in on this one.",
            "It's this giddy whimsy that makes Everybody Wants Some!! so damned likable.",

            "EVERYBODY WANTS SOME!! may lack the subtlety and richness of Linklater's best work, but it remains an incredibly exhilarating film that will leave you with warm feelings of nostalgia.",
            "Living with Linklater's characters as they explore life, unsupervised, without inhibition, engages the heart and takes you back to a freewheeling, optimistic state of mind and body that many of us let go of a long time ago. "

            "Humorous look at the stalled career of a stand-up comedian.",
            "While it's equal parts funny, poignant and trenchant, the film mostly acts as a pulpit for Birbiglia to vent his frustrations pointedly at the person who eclipsed his career.",
            "Don't Think Twice actually shows Birbiglia to be in the mold of Robert Altman, a naturalistic filmmaker sympathetic enough to show even the \"bad\" characters in a good light and caustic enough to tarnish the supposed heroes.",
            "Don't Think Twice has comedy as its subject, but it is a far more dramatic and perplexing affair than a comic one.",
            "The film is not a grand exercise in maturation but in reality.",

            "A sequel to an awful movie, NYSM 2 is so bad that not even doubling the amount of Woody Harrelsons can fix it.",

            "This is an intelligent, carefully measured drama boasting multiple layers of story and emotion.",

            "Braga is fearless in her portrayal of Clara and mesmerising as the film meanders.",
            "Aquarius is a lovely testament to the importance of not allowing capital values to encroach upon your history, your past, your heritage and your memories. ",
            "[Braga's] very presence inspires you to keep faith in your belief in what is right, and to find strength in resisting what you know to be wrong.",
            "Braga gives the character an indestructible sense of self, showcasing a range of emotions that defy easy categorization.",
            "Sonia Braga is awe-inspiring.",
            "The visuals echo the sensation of running your hand over a surface, giving Aquarius a completely apposite tactile quality that Dona Clara would cherish.",
            "Best scenes are the fiery enounters between Sonia Braga's character and greedy developers.",
            "... Aquarius contains a keen sense of history, and how the fundamental questions of identity and personal physical space can tie together memory and objects, music and the body, and how family itself is a living embodiment of history.",
            "Sonia Braga plays Clara. She covers a range from sweetly adoring gramma to tough momma with chiding children, from a political beast to a woman longing for physical love. ",
            "This clever, nuanced drama doubles as a political allegory concerning Brazilian corruption. But it would matter, regardless. A dawning, as the similarly-titled song has it. ",
            "Aquarius is the excellent new film from director Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho, which upon viewing appears to be simply a heartfelt look at the personal cost of gentrification.",
            "This film is the story of a free woman but above all, the renewal of a favorite Hollywood plot: the rebellion of women. [Full review in Spanish]"

            "It's the strategic vaporousness of the entire enterprise-its canny refusal to be \"about\" anything except an immersion its own roiling, over-conscientiously detailed millennial milieu-that rankles.",
            "Lane is a find -- bruised, soft, dreamy, hopeful -- and the film is at its strongest exploring the erotic chemistry between her and LaBeouf.",
            "For all its flaws, it's a strangely absorbing film.",

            "By the time the film enters its second hour, the goodwill generated by the fresh faced enthusiasm of the actors and flashes of fleeting, accidental beauty is ground down by the editing's oppressive tedium.",

            "It might not be a perfect documentary, but it gets us inside the Church, by hook or crook, and lets us examine what dark secrets they are hiding.",

            "Things do get better, thanks to his (Louis Theroux's) legendary patience, his entertaining baiting of church members in their own lair, and his success in persuading a number of former church members to spill the beans.",
            "While at times too caught up in his stunt-journalism conceit, [Louis] Theroux does uncover a particular Los Angeles kookiness beneath the world's most famous cult.",

            "Let it never be said that if you've seen one inspirational sports movie, you've seen them all.",
            "Very solid, very sound entertainment, with thumpingly good Pritam songs that make Eye of the Tiger seem like pipsqueakery.",
            "Although in terms of substance the movie has its issues, in terms of impression and presentation, it truly thrives.",
            "This December release has provided a truly happy ending to what has already been a good year for Hindi cinema.",
            "Tough father trains unwilling daughters to be champions. ",
            "Maybe my biggest issue with the film is that it plays safe, in sharp contrast to its sport and gender-empowering subjects: when was the last time wrestling was considered a safe career, both literally and figuratively?",
            "It is to the film's credit that though Geeta and Babita's wins are documented, it still manages to engage the viewer with the wrestling tournaments and bring patriotic emotions to the fore. Most importantly, Dangal scores with its first-rate performances.",
            "Dangal is a perfect entry point for outsiders afraid to approach Bollywood cinema.",
            "This film is a thundering body slam of honest emotions and sheer hard work. ",
            "This feel-good sports drama based on true stories entertains and, more importantly, could empower young women to pursue male-dominated industries.",
            "The sequences are wonderfully shot and choreographed, so much so that it is difficult to believe the actors aren't full-time wrestlers. And at the centre of it all is Aamir Khan. He plays Mahavir with practiced authority and impeccable timing.",
            "Dangal is the last major film to be rolled out in 2016 and Khan has saved the best for the last for his fans.",
            "As a study of single-minded dedication, Nitesh Tiwari's biopic Dangal could not have had a a more apt lead... Aamir Khan is perfectly cast as Mahavir Singh Phogat.",
            "This could be Aamir Khan's best performance till date. Yes, even better than Lagaan.",
            "The film's drama feels authentic, and not just because it's based on a true story."

            "It's honourable, it's well-intentioned, but it's lame.",
            "There's a crippling lack of emotional depth and honesty - it's hard to decide which is more stridently melodramatic, the bombast of the score or the shrill performances.",
            "It is, however, a heartfelt and painstaking attempt at dealing in filmic terms with the complex and ambiguous subject matter of the book.",
            "It's like a balloon with a slow leak; it's more of a slow descent than an outright crash and burn, but either way, you're left feeling low.",
            "Roth is an author that many have deemed unadaptable, but American Pastoral gets more right than it gets wrong. This should be applauded.",
            "American Pastoral has two things going for it: Pitch perfect casting and the strength of the source material.",
            "Proving to have a beautiful directorial eye....and chronologically efficient script by John Romano that retains the emotional and historical depth and richness of Roth's work, [Ewan] McGregor now delivers an immersive and compelling work.",
            "As a first effort, McGregor's directorial debut is lacking, but perhaps he chose to bite off a huge chunk by taking on a literary masterpiece.",
            "Love can be the wind in someone's sails or the anchor dragging them down to the bottom of the sea; McGregor wants to explore both sides. ",
            "McGregor can't quite pull off the cockishness and larger-than-life zeal of a young Swede: he seems already beaten somewhat when we meet him, meaning that his fall into ignominy is less jarring than it should be. ",
            "...the trouble with American Pastoral is that these individually competent scenes are strung together into an inchoate whole.",
            "There are plenty of good scenes, but ultimately American Pastoral is less than the sum of its admirable parts. The story is meant to capture an American event through one man's misadventures, but the overall effect is of a painful melodrama.",
            "Quickly dissolves into contrived drama and uneven and skewed character motivations. ",
            "Fails to suss out Roth's biting Jewish angst and humor.",
            "The film is a tad too long but nevertheless is well acted and rather moving.",
            "American Pastoral is boring at best, but it will play well to one audience-white suburban parents. ",
            "The film gets to where it's going by the midpoint and then just sits there, grinding your face in its (or Swede's? or Roth's?) hatred of the 1960s.",
            "Not only does the book defeat McGregor, the neophyte director; it also defeats McGregor, the accomplished actor. ",

            "The film directed by Andr\u00e9 T\u00e9chin\u00e9 also does a masterful job of capturing the confusion of adolescence and the general inability to put feelings into words at that age",
            "Instead of three acts, T\u00e9chin\u00e9 divides the story into three trimesters, and while the artificial constructs only pile on from there, very little about the film feels false.",
            "Being 17 is not easy, but I look forward to Being 18 all the same to see where these guys end up.",
            "Being 17 is a thoughtful coming-of-age story with great performances, honest storytelling, beautiful cinematography and subtle direction that is sure to delight; if you can overlook its questionable morals.",

            "Its emotional beats strike honest notes, well played by the actors in the clutch moments...T\u00e9chin\u00e9 and Sciamma prove that there is, in truth, beauty, as in youth and mountain greenery, as in nature's need and human nature's desire. [Blu-ray]",
            "Better than a Hollywood adolescent getting-laid comedy, or a socially-conscious message movie, Being 17 is so lively that watching its characters rushing through their encounters produces a rare sense of discovery.",
            "The thin line between love and hate dissolves almost entirely in Being 17, a deeply satisfying coming-of-age and coming-out tale set at the picturesque foot of the Pyrenees by director Andr\u00e9 T\u00e9chin\u00e9.",
            "There's a screwball complication that draws out the class differences between the boys, but their hate-love bonding comes from beating each other up, a two-boy fight club... The brute mix of emotion and sensation suits the confusion of their age.",
            "It's a sheer delight to watch these two boys -- on their way to becoming men -- challenge and provoke each other, before they finally embrace.",

            "Bleak biopics don't have to be grim (think of Raging Bull). But this one is neither illuminating nor able to make the most of the dark.",
            "To derive any pleasure from the film ... you probably need to be able to listen to Williams's hit Lovesick Blues without wanting to hack off your own ears.",
            "If they were to give out awards for the most by-the-numbers release of the year ... then this study of Hank Williams would take some beating",
            "I Saw The Light gives us an exceptional central performance -- but one that is entombed in a very dull and listless film.",
            "Hiddleston's singing and playing is to be admired, but there is a dull two hour film wrapped around it. Even the inevitable tragic ending left me cold, and it doesn't take much to get me crying at films. What a shame.",
            "[Tom] Hiddleston mesmerizes. . .Elizabeth Olsen astonishes!",
            "Tom Hiddleston's excellent performance as Hank Williams deserved a better film but the performance alone is not enough to save I Saw The Light.",

            "Though there are \"steel guitars and weeping fiddles\" a-plenty, as a final comment sums up, and despite the good performances throughout, the film still feels like a missed opportunity to get to the heart of its intriguing subject.",
            "I Saw the Light is unstructured and slogs its way through the troubled rise and fall of arguably one of country music's most legendary figures.",
            "Hiddleston's performance desperately tries to keep \"I Saw the Light\" afloat, but it can't overcome some serious problems in the film's screenplay and direction.",
            "We see enough to make us wish we could see much more with greater clarity.",
            "With no emotional attachment to the characters and a plot that struggles to stay interesting, \"I Saw the Light\" is often dull and a hard sell. ",
            "For all of the great performances, Abraham chooses to focus on the fussin' and fightin' between Hank and Audrey like a walking talking country song instead of the grit and determination that got Williams to the Grand Ole Opry.",
            "I Saw the Light may not be the most exciting biopic to hit the screens as of late, but Hiddleston truly nails the troubled singer.",
            "If you can get over the idea of England's Tom Hiddleston (The Night Manager) playing country and western legend Hank Williams, then Marc Abraham's picture is a perfectly respectable glimpse of the troubled singer's life and times.",
            "It's just like its subject on New Year's Day 1953: The film I Saw the Light is dead on arrival.",
            "Feeling like a rough assembly of the deleted scenes of the film we should be watching, it's mind-numbingly flat and passionless.",
            "At more than two hours, it's way too long, the pointlessly wobbly camerawork is annoying, and Abraham's distinctly theatrical screenplay often feels as forced and mannered as the acting is, at times, overblown.",
            "I Saw the Light is not good, and I don't recommend it.",
            "The pace is leaden, and the story sends you out feeling as if you know little more about Williams than you did when you entered.",
            "I Saw the Light foregoes spending any real time with the music and the musicians, instead turning its gaze on the pedestrian details of the marital drama between the great man and his wife Audrey."

            "It's a lot of skill and talent expended on a spat a good lawyer could probably have sorted out during the opening credit sequence. Instead Lafosse offers a lot of the \"after,\" and none of the \"love.\"",
            "For most of its running time, director and co-writer Joachim Lafosse gives the impression that he's drilled a hole into the side of a married couple's home in order to afford audiences an unmediated, worm's eye view of their gradual dissolution.",
            "Messy and ungovernable at its strongest, Lafosse's film is a story of heartbreak and real estate and, not least, money, viewed from within the still-smoldering ruins.",
            "Intimacy might be a source of irritation, but in After Love it can be downright excruciating. ",
            "Lafosse, along with actors B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo and C\u00e9dric Kahn, infuse the film with a brutal honesty that makes it, if not exactly enjoyable, certainly compelling.",
            "[A] perceptive drama ...",
            "After Love is a film of harsh truths and humanistic empathy, finding a middle ground between love turned to hate and tolerance so that one may more fully love one's children.",
            "Bejo and Kahn are so good at illustrating shades of cruelty and kindness in their performances that it's near impossible not to feel the tension and volatility of the situation. ",
            "After Love is a very realistic, touching, and at times poignant even view on a couple's separation, divorce, and division of assets. ",
            "Stay away, couples in crisis. It's too real. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "The repetitive, insincere, and ultimately pointless dialogue in this crucial scene thoroughly tinges one's impression of the whole film.",
            "[After Love] is even painful for us viewers.",
            "Slow moving, the movie wades through a sea of hostilities while we wait for a major blow-up or a thaw in the ice that allows these two to reveal something about what made them a couple in the first place.",
            "\"After Love,\" directed and cowritten by Belgian filmmaker Joachim Lafosse, is an insightful and involving drama centering on the collapse of a marriage.",
            "[Joachim Lafosse's] camera favors a glum v\u00e9rit\u00e9 that simply records the unraveling of love.",
            "After Love is sometimes hard to watch-but that's mostly because it's boring.",
            "A moving, unflinching drama with raw performances by B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo and C\u00e9dric Kahn.",
            "Most films about relationships on the rocks center on things like betrayal and guilt and lust. Rare is the work that tackles one of the most common and corrosive sources of conflict among couples: financial instability.",
            "Though undoubtedly a flawed enterprise, After Love is a formal wonder, due to the efforts of Lafosse, photographer Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Hensgens, and production designer Olivier Radot.",
            "The film too often puts too much trust in dialogue, as Marie and Boris's predicament is sometimes perfectly conveyed by the actors' facial expressions and body language.",
            "An irritating movie about irritating people.",
            "As sharp and savage as any breakup drama this side of A Separation.",
            "If it's intensity of atmosphere, insightful character study and a career-best performance from B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo you want, then you won't go wrong with After Love.",
            "Grueling French tale about what happens when two people no longer in love refuse to move out."

            "Weiner is a brisk, laugh-out-loud, fascinating peek into the campaign offices and living rooms of the people ensnared in Anthony Weiner's bizarre political saga.",
            "If Weiner was a scripted film it wouldn't be nearly as impressive, but the fact that the filmmakers were able to perfectly translate Weiner's doomed campaign to film makes it impressive. ",
            "Here is the perfect example of what happens when all players, including the voters, behave according to their nature.",
            "At once painful, painfully funny, horrifying, and utterly, completely, depressingly riveting.",
            "Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg's captivating political documentary Weiner could just as easily be named Huma, the film's second subject who proves equally as captivating.",
            "Fascinating documentary.",
            "Weiner's offhand gallows humour, and a wealth of archive material make for a tragicomic masterpiece.",
            "This brilliant, fast-moving, totally entertaining documentary's huge achievement is to take a minor American political figure and make his life totally involving and thought-provoking to audiences outside America.",
            " Weiner is trying to re-launch his brand, but it's the media who ultimately decide how it will be sold.",
            "The beauty of the film's representation of the Weiner-Abedin subplot is that a fiction film couldn't have captured it any better.",
            "Anthony Weiner will be a gross and embarrassing footnote in history, albeit a masterfully documented footnote.",
            "The crew tackles the behind-the-scenes of a political family better than House of Cards, juggling intimacy and work's reality while each side jockeys for control.",

            "\"Equity\" is that rare thing: a Wall Street-set movie that focuses on women. (It's also directed and written by women, also still rare.)",
            "Although suffering from moments of unintentional camp thanks to some dramatic bits of dialogue, Entity manages to accomplish a lot with very little. ",
            "The filmmakers overplay their hand with a cast befitting a cruise ship vacation, unfortunately without any clear sense of where the boat is heading, or how to disembark before final credits roll.",
            "In Equity it's never clear who will come out on top, and the resolution is more true-to-life than we're used to. ",
            "I couldn't help but suspect that Menon and Fox must have felt this was their one chance to surface every issue they could think of relating to being a woman on Wall Street (or just in general), and for me, it took away from the rest of the film.",
            "Equity is not a perfect film, but it does use its story to explore a number of issues facing women in this competitive industry.",
            "Three of its four main characters are women, but director Meera Menon and screenwriter Amy Fox do not portray them merely as men in pencil skirts and pants suits. ",
            "It's a refreshing spin that may not always hit the mark, but is effective enough to be worth a look.",
            "It's not always great or pretty, but Equity packs a socially conscious punch.",
            "The film is not fancy and its pace is prosaic, but it manages to get us right to the heart of American greed. You see it for what it is and the director, Meera Menon, leaves you there with no mercy.",
            "It's extremely refreshing to see a movie about women and power where the power the women have doesn't come from their sexuality. ",
            "What makes Equity particularly interesting - and probably broadens its appeal - is the fact that it's less a women's movie than a movie whose main characters happen to be women.",
            "Like \"The Big Short,\" an investigation into Wall Street corruption.",
            "Equity is a film by women, about women -- lesbian and straight -- and starring women. Take note.",
            "With Equity, director Meera Menon asserts that our conception of ambitious women is too limited. We're not all leaning in for the same reasons.",
            "The performances are good; the story is smart - though admittedly a bit convoluted for those of us who struggle with Wall Street jargon.",
            "Depictions like in Equity, refusing to conform to stereotypes or caricatures, are the depictions we need in today's society. ",

            "For a story that is replete with so many layers, Desai handles the narrative with all the finesse of a bull in a china shop.",
            "Rustom is just an ineffectual reimagining of meaty source material. Its cause is not helped by ominous-sounding background music that attempts to create tension throughout.",
            "Tinu Desai's much-anticipated Rustom is many things - but mostly it is a crushing disappointment for fans of Bollywood's resident patriot, Akshay Kumar.",
            "Tinu Suresh Desai's film, written by Vipul K Rawal, is unabashedly tacky and unintentionally hilarious, though it does have its moments."

            "If you can sit through 30 interspersed minutes of trivialities, New York, New York emerges victoriously as the musical of the year, and reaffirms Liza Minelli's position as one of the top musical stars, as well as talented actress, on the screen.",

            "Though affectionate and colorfully stylized, Scorsese's tribute to the darker classic Hollywood musicals is only partially successful...an interesting feature that ultimately fails as a period piece or dark musical.",
            "Ultimately a very personal film about how Scorsese views a genre of film and, as such, has a much more coherent vision than its reputation would suggest. [Blu-ray]",
            "A stagebound valentine, but one vigorously constructed down to the last detail, with Scorsese reveling in the costumes and music. It's an itch that spreads into a full-body rash in the final act.",
            "A downbeat homage to bright-lights showbiz dramas, an epic orchestration that indulges in stubbornly obsessive riffs, Martin Scorsese's New York, New York (1977) seems to value awkwardness and indecision above all else. ",
            "Embora interessante, a dire\u00e7\u00e3o de arte acaba se tornando uma distra\u00e7\u00e3o e os n\u00fameros musicais s\u00e3o, em sua maioria, frouxos. Por outro lado, De Niro e Minnelli criam personagens complexos que despertam a curiosidade do espectador. Um Scorsese menor.",

            "Baye, a veteran actress, gives a fine performance as an ordinary woman dealing with her career, motherhood and relationship. Her Marlene's guarded friendliness hides her dormant venom which we get to see a glimpse of.",
            "If the anti-climax was designed to confound my thirst for vengeance, it succeeded.",
            "I sat down for a \"French revenge thriller\" but instead got a meditation on the dangers of snap emotional judgments ... and it was something I didn't know I needed.",

            "Veteran actors Devos and Baye perfectly play their quiet cat-and-mouse, generating a patient suspense.",
            "The viewer, as its captive audience, feels the intensifying compression when the two women square off in this climactic scene",
            "The smoothly structured, beautifully acted Moka builds slowly toward a tug of war between thriller conventions and deeper emotions. And the audience wins.",
            "Moka becomes a revenge story that's more interested in exploring Diane's obsessive need for clarity than in serving another up trumped up drama. The result: A small, but intriguing movie.",
            "It's a beautiful, and often suspenseful, drama.",
            "Suspenseful, outstandingly so at times, but it doesn't indulge bloodlust, taking a far more disorientating route to a sense of satisfaction, and doing so with terrific performances from stars Devos and Baye.",
            "There is a dearth of curiosity here, so instead of a dramatic thriller, Moka is a mirthless revenge tale that defaults toward drama.",
            "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mermoud's Moka is a revenge potboiler that never quite boils while you're watching it.",
            "Moka is fascinating in its own way. It's a film that, despite my misgivings, I couldn't quite get myself to look away from.",
            "If you want a murder mystery, look elsewhere. This movie is all about Emmanuelle Devos.",
            "Tense moments arise not from any plot machinations but from the anticipation of the next exquisitely calibrated response by Emmanuelle Devos, the film's star, who appears in every scene.",
            "The movie's climax has sufficient twists and turns for a conventional payoff. But the movie, adapted from a novel by Tatiana de Rosnay, is ultimately more concerned with the genuinely tragic dimensions of the story than its suspense angles.",
            "Moka is a neat package, pleasingly spare in its dialogue, that might have seemed like a minor Hitchcockian exercise if not for Devos. She remains the most dangerous woman in French cinema.",
            "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mermoud's film makes an elaborate pretense of honoring the traditions of the observational procedural. "

            "Despite its stated obsession with all things \"peculiar,\" there's little about this movie that is actually surprising. It comes across like a movie going through the motions of setting up a franchise, not a movie eager to bring you on a wild adventure.",

            "On paper, it might be just another damp Young Adult squib. In execution, it's a lovely, fun thing.",
            "The young peculiars have names, but they don't get much by way of backstory or personality. Despite the movie's insistence that they are special, Miss Peregrine ultimately reduces them to the very thing the world rejected them for: their peculiarities. ",
            "It falls short of being the film Burton fans are likely hoping it will be. ",
            "The bad character development, the abundant plot holes, and the non-existent directing are simply unforgivable. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a perfect pre-Halloween adventure, a primer for scarier stuff to come, and I am genuinely pleased that Tim Burton has found a story that allows him to be subversive within a tale meant for children.",
            "Overall this movie is a little above average fair that moves around fast enough to not have you really think about the plot holes and why characters actually do what they are doing.",

            "With only a slight misstep along the way, the whimsy and occasional grimness use to send a message about celebrating our differences makes Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is one of Tim Burton's best films in recent memory.",
            "[It] is the director's most original film in years, one that shows a more mature tone while still providing plenty of his signature fantasy tale.",
            "Everyone feels miscast and bored in the film.",
            "Thank goodness for the adults. Samuel L Jackson and Eva Green are a living, breathing dream that elevate this film to a level it almost doesn't deserve.",

            "Using only archival footage and narration from those in and around the band, it chronicles Oasis' story in an entertaining fashion that doesn't shy away from the Gallagher brothers' brash and egotistical personalities.",
            "You can't help but root for these belligerent, confrontational delinquents to make good.",
            "By eschewing cultural context, outside voices, or songwriting analysis, the film matches the group's insular arrogance, although there's genuine insight into the family dynamic.",

            "There is also the ever-impressive acting prowess of Hanks capturing spot-on the reticent real-life hero... Editing and tonal inconsistencies notwithstanding, if those aspects sound compelling, it might be worth the price of admission.",
            "Tom Hanks was fantastic as the stoic pilot turned reluctant hero whose brave decision saved hundreds of lives.",
            "Sympathy, compassion, and unselfish behavior are unfortunately qualities the modern world doesn't always embrace. It's at least a breath of fresh air to see our entertainment embrace that concept with open arms and completely soar with it.",

            "It's incredible that Clint Eastwood can make one of his best films so late into his career and so soon after one of his worst, American Sniper."

            "Befikre is entertaining at a superficial level, but at the end of the day it is nothing but old wine in a glossy new bottle.",
            "The biggest problem with Aditya Chopra's Befikre is that it feels made by a director wanting to prove he still belongs, which is why nothing looks comfortable.",
            "If you care for some laughs, some YRF nostalgia and are, well, promiscuous with your choice of romcoms, you could take a chance with this one.",
            "It has a deep desire to be erotic and funny but for all its progressive ambitions, it tells a jaded story.",
            "Watch this film if you are fan of syrupy romances or Ranveer Singh's groupie. Otherwise, jump into this at your own risk.",
            "Chopra, the maker of one of Bollywood's most enduring love stories, wanted to move with the times, but he didn't quite get a hold of the Dharam-Shyra generation as he did the Raj-Simran generation.",
            "There is hardly anything more to the movie other than the lip-locks and some funny moments. ",
            "Befikre begins on a promising note and slowly turns into a film that's been made and released several times before."

            "While its beats are a bit roughhewn and familiar, impressive performance and a prosaic examination of an unyielding profession... supplies Preljocaj and Muller's debut collaboration with enough zest to justify a journey to an exquisite denouement.",

            "This exquisite portrait of a dancer finding her way in the world is vibrant, captivating and engaging.",
            "Polina [is] one of the most emotionally accurate coming-of-age films of recent years.",

            "Polina isn't the deepest drama but the dancing elevates a story that sometimes feels predictable. Credit Shevtsova with creating a character who's trying to use her training and develop her own style.",

            "Without breaking many rules, Gimme Danger honours these admirable rule-breakers.",

            "The real reason for shelling out for this one... is Iggy's unique gift for gab, and his impressive physical state.",
            "Other highly appreciable dynamic elements are the photographic inserts, archival material, classic cinema and educational reels from the fifties used in a montage. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "A comprehensive picture of Detroit in the late 1960s and the impoverished roots that frontman Iggy Pop (born James Osterberg) and his mates - Dave Alexander on bass, Scott Asheton behind the drums and his brother Ron on guitar - came from.",
            "A rockumentary on the seminal band the Stooges, \"the greatest rock 'n' roll band ever,\" at least according to filmmaker Jim Jarmusch.",
            "Like Jarmusch's movies, Gimme Danger is 100% authentic cool from beginning to end, fortified by Iggy Pop's shirtless interviews and joint-smoked memories.",
            "This isn't going to remake the reputation of the Stooges, but it'll give new insights to even the most devoted fans in a vibrant piece of documentary filmmaking.",
            "As the story unfolds, Jarmusch's reverent approach to his subjects and relaxed sense of drama ends up underselling a band once considered not just groundbreaking but dangerous.",
            "Jarmusch's direction may not entirely do justice to such formally radical music... but he knows how to get out of the way and let Iggy tell his own story.",
            "Gimme Danger is an upbeat affair which benefits from some stylistic touches from Jarmusch.",
            "... what it might lack in formal distinction it easily makes up for in shake appeal.",
            "Witty, loving and fuelled by some of the finest rock n' roll music, Gimme Danger is unashamedly nostalgic, yet it also makes you leave the cinema with a lump in your throat that there's just no one quite like the young Iggy in music anymore.",
            "Gimme Danger is a love letter from a fan: it avoids a lot of nasty details, but makes you feel that you didn't really need them anyway.",
            "Gimme Danger is a powerful, if not totally raw, portrait of rock and roll's purest Dionysian spirit. ",
            "Pop, now a leonine elder statesman, is a salty, charming interview subject, but this is a surprisingly dry and conventional telling of the band's halcyon days (and eventual reformation).",
            "Despite all the hardships, the film is enchanting as a tale of people who, for the most part, did what they loved, and in some cases are still doing it.",
            "In what proves a primer and a tribute combined, it's the obvious affection and the unexpected moments alike that give Gimme Danger its entertaining edge. ",
            "It took a while, but the world eventually caught up with the Stooges. What a difference 40 years can make.",
            "Gimme Danger demonstrates reverence for a one-of-a-kind collective of musicians."

            "Lo and Behold seems to be stoking fears that our tools are evolving beyond our capacity to control them, which offers an intriguing twist on his usual theme of the indifference of nature. ",
            "As with many Herzog films the results are complex, endlessly fascinating, sometimes disturbing and often weird.",
            "A lesser Werner, but still worth dipping your brain into.",
            "It's a sporadically fascinating film that dips its toe into many different themes where perhaps it should have chosen to immerse itself in just one or two.",
            "He specialises in stories about impossible dreams and defying nature and for his latest film Werner Herzog turns to the most ambitious, abominable creation of them all: the internet.",
            "It's Herzog's uncertainty as a tourist in the field that gives the film its enticing charge, as surely as his wanderings in the Antarctic, or gropings in the dark to find the world's oldest cave paintings.",
            "Thoroughly comprehensive and often humorous meditation on our connected world, Lo and Behold is yet another masterwork by a master chronicler of human experience.",
            "As in many of his other films, the subject matter is paradoxically both crucial and incidental: Lo and Behold is a film about the internet in the same way that Fitzcarraldo is about an opera house, or Grizzly Man is about some guy who really liked bears.",
            "Lo and Behold presents an excellent start of a conversation, but...you won't be getting any answers here.",
            "It's clever and funny in parts, and there's plenty of food for thought, but it's also pretty scary by the end of it. ",
            "There is poetry in that, and it's not lost on scientist Leonard Kleinrock, who recounts the story in Lo and Behold: Reveries of the Connected World.",
            "Not [Werner Herzo's] best but he's engaging enough to make it a fun watch.",
            "It's hard not to get a little incredulous when Herzog waxes all end-of-days about soccer-playing trash cans, or when he lingers with horror on an extremely frail robot unscrewing an empty jar (\"Soon it vill be unscrewing youuuuu,\" he seems to whisper).",
            "The resultant film is an exhilarating, fascinating, and somewhat terrifying meditation on the consequences of connection.",
            "Although far from perfect, this fragmented, curious and cautious tale of our connected world makes for essential viewing.",
            "The internet has fundamentally changed the lives of every single person on the Earth, and such a seismic shift in how people live their lives fascinates Herzog, and we're lucky enough that he wishes to share his fascination with the rest of us.",
            "Despite being beautifully shot, it's not one of the director's best. Herzog should have understood that to the new god he's trying to uncover, tweeting and praying are the same thing.",
            "If Lo and Behold lacks the otherworldly strangeness of Herzog's best documentaries, it remains slyly unsettling for other reasons... Herzog gleefully considers a future dystopia caused by our over-reliance on the web.",
            "Lo and Behold makes sure to inextricably tie utopian goals to darker, more deadly possible outcomes. But the paradox is that the film is strangely inspiring even in its more alarming moments.",
            "The joys and sorrows evoked by one of the greatest inventions of all time.",
            "Lo and Behold, a geek flick, approaches incomprehensibility at times for the un-nerdy, but it raises good questions.",
            "It's as if [Herzog] wants to understand how life works while harboring a deep-seated realization that it's all just a horrible mistake.",
            "It's a reverie indeed- part dream, part nightmare-and yet again Herzog's way of looking proves to be both illuminating and entertaining.",
            "This film is definitely one of the most interesting documentaries of the year so far."

            "Despite the whiff of awards bait, Murphy, one of America's comic treasures, delivers a refined and dignified performance, but his character remains a phantasmagorical presence from the first frame to the last.",
            "Very hokey and old-fashioned in its sensibilities, but Eddie Murphy's performance is excellent. ",

            "There are several things to like about a quiet drama like Mr. Church. But the thing that feels most notable about director Bruce Beresford's story of a young woman and her unique father figure is the presence of Eddie Murphy in the title role.",
            "\"Mr. Church\" isn't big on surprises, transforming into tearjerker mode for the finale, but it does have Murphy. It just doesn't know what to do with him.",
            "We waited four years for a new Eddie Murphy movie ... and this is what we got?",
            "Those involved didn't just want to make any old tearjerker; they sought to squeeze their audience dry like a sponge.",
            "Murphy gives the thankless role some soul, and bit of a twinkle in his eye, but it's not enough to free the movie from a swamp of phony sentimentality.",
            "...the story of how a perfect black servant solves a white girl's every problem without ever once being threatening or contrary",
            "Somehow Murphy manages to lift his dignified, all-knowing servant character off the page, giving a meticulously composed performance in a vehicle that can't help but feel superficially repackaged.",
            "It aims for tears and gets them.",
            "Get out your handkerchiefs, but don't expect to believe a minute of this vastly improbable tale."

            "3 Generations is contrived, but the heartfelt performances keep the threadbare material on track-witty, warm and wise.",
            "This is a movie that derives most of its suspense on whether a piece of paper will be signed, not a strong basis for dramatic tension.",
            "3 Generations is well-intended and heart-warming, but a mess, and problematic besides. ",
            "If you can look past the sitcom humor, that late-in-the-game melodrama and the usual cliche about the mature child in a family of immature adults, \"3 Generations\" does a few important things.",
            "In the hands of a more capable filmmaker, 3 Generations could be a challenging, prismatic view of the gender identity discussion. Instead, it's a sloppy waste of time.",
            "Even if it feels quite confusing in its genre, the drama tends to unfold pretty well. A third act that should never have existed. [Full review in Spanish].",
            "Technical flaws aside, the biggest disservice of \"3 Generations\" is the missed opportunity to have an actual transgender actor play the part of Ray, or at the very least a more anonymous actor.",
            "This is an after-school special with an A-list cast.",
            "It might look and feel like a \"TV movie,\" but Fanning wills 3 Generations toward something richer and more nuanced - something that matters.",
            "This film's generational awareness is a welcome change from the mainstream media's usual treatment of LGBTQ issues as different than other, traditional sexual concerns.",
            "Despite its promise, there is nothing modern about 3 Generations and its approach to trans representation.",
            "3 Generations has its heart in the right place, but everything else about it is spiraling into too many directions",
            "... aspires to be both heartfelt and provocative, yet its melodramatic approach just scratches the surface of its relevant subject matter.",
            "Director Gaby Dellal's 3 Generations encourages its audience to look at the transgender community with a humane and compassionate eye, but her film will probably reinforce more perspectives than it changes.",
            "3 Generations clearly means well, but it attempts to tell a \"universal\" story about changing family dynamics and the physical shifts of puberty via a specific phenomenon which it does not truly comprehend.",
            "The writing and the acting on the part of the entire cast dovetail nicely into a modern familial tale well told.",
            "3 Generations goes a long way toward fostering empathy in an (art-house) crowd-pleasing package, with warmth and humor and soap opera-grade drama.",
            "In the end, 3 Generations wants to to be about trans issues more than it really wants to live in them.",
            "Performances stand out in earnest drama about trans teen. ",
            "Another bloodless example of Hollywood's cowardice in grappling with the world as it is. 3 Generations doesn't cut deep into the torn-from-the-headlines issue of trans rights. In fact, it doesn't cut at all. ",
            "Takes on the topic of gender dysphoria with a talented cast but not much to say.",
            "When this well-acted picture calms down and focuses on real emotions, it proves a poignant, absorbing look at a modern family."

            "Naharin's style is both idiosyncratic and accessible, his movements both angular and supple, but above all his dances celebrate the body, built for the joy of motion.",
            "Naharin's dances, amply illustrated from decades' worth of film, are visceral, emotional and sometimes shocking.",
            "The portrait of the artist might be a bit uncritically rosy; still, this is a compelling dance film that captures the drive and passion of a key figure in contemporary choreography.",

            "Heymann may have omitted too much due to overestimating the public's knowledge of Naharin's career, yet Mr Gaga is always interesting, and at times deeply moving.",
            "Although the film doesn't truly define Naharin's Gaga style of dance, it's still a fascinating look inside the life and mind of the reigning godfather of modern dance",
            "[B]odies are bent, not broken. The results are resilient, ravishing, resounding.",
            "[Director Tomer] Heymann smartly lets the art speak for itself and for [Ohad] Naharin.",
            "Gaga [has] an emphasis on personal interpretation of the music rather than formal technique ... Director Tomer Heymann shows some startling examples of the results; I just wish we could see more of them, and in greater length.",
            "This is a documentary that anyone who cares about art will respond to. Naharin is an intriguing subject -- not always truthful or predictable, but utterly compassionate and principled in his own uneasy way.",
            "Mr. Gaga doesn't really explain why the demanding choreographer is called Mr. Gaga, but dance fans will still be in thrall to this charismatic figure and his rule-bending art.",
            "The picture's timeline is a bit wonky ... and especially frustrating is a second-act twist that reveals the story about how he got into dance, presented as truth in the first act, was entirely made up for no good reason. ",
            "In performance and rehearsal clips, Heymann's saturated cinematography captures the raw physicality and emotion of Naharin's work, and the way he cajoles, demeans and seduces his dancers.",
            "Gaga looks like fun, but the soul-revealing \"Mr. Gaga\" makes clear the sacrifice Naharin's dedication has exacted from family and dancers alike.",
            "The dancing alone is worth the price of admission, and Naharin is a dynamic if somewhat aloof subject.",
            "When someone can talk as well as they create, the rewards are considerable, as the documentary \"Mr. Gaga: A True Story of Love and Dance\" convincingly demonstrates.",
            "Perhaps fans already keyed into Naharin's genius will get more out of Mr. Gaga, but for everyone else, this saggy, aimless, superficial documentary won't offer enough to enlighten you.",
            "A fascinating if uneven portrait.",
            "Mr. Gaga consequently never coheres into a meaningful commentary on Maharin, an artist whose vital work defies easy categorization.",
            "A superb dance documentary in its almost single-minded focus on process.",
            "Mr. Naharin is an intriguing figure. But \"Mr. Gaga\" is a scattered and somewhat confused film."

            "Ghostbusters is like romping through Disneyland's haunted house with Bill Murray.",
            "Ghostbusters is primarily a showcase for Murray, who slinks through the movie muttering his lines in his usual cheeky fashion and getting off an occasionally hilarious crack that proves he's thoroughly enjoying himself.",
            "The plotting may be primitive, but it's all carried off with far more style and finesse than one might expect from the creators of Animal House and Meatballs.",
            "Part of the sheer joy of this movie -- aside from the comic timing of Bill Murray -- is the cartoonish crapness of its apparitions and their placid acceptance by the Ghostbusters team.",
            "On balance, Ghostbusters is a hoot. It's Murray's picture, and in a triumph of mind over matter, he blows away the film's boring special effects with his one-liners.",
            "A fantasy, but with no touches of reality at all, to be enjoyed for its zany humour typical of the \"National Lampoon\" school from which several of its contributors are drawn.",
            "It's the thrills of wraith-combating, action-packed citywide devastation, and carefree attitudes that highlight the adventures and give the film a strong sense of originality.",
            "It is not intended to change anyone's life, just invite you to follow a fun and crazy group. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "Partly because of the cast, partly because of the effects, partly because of Elmer Bernstein's score, and partly because of [Ivan] Reitman's directing style, it all just worked -- and it still does",

            "It speaks to its entire audience, without ever seeming to joke over children's heads in a snide or overly knowing manner.",
            "The elastic structure provides ample room for inspired surrealism, yet the looseness never compromises the film's tongue-in-cheek love letter to pre-gentrification Manhattan or its piercing satire of Reaganite go-getting ...",
            "Thirty years later, there are still rumblings of making another sequel, but no one would dare suggest a reboot or re-imagining; Ghostbusters is perfect exactly as it is.",
            "If you've never experienced GHOSTBUSTERS on the big screen, you really need to go see this. If not I'm afraid you'll have to turn in your geek card. ",
            "Ghostbusters thrives on the fine line between taking it all seriously enough to be scary, then poking fun at it in the most creative ways possible.",
            "GHOSTBUSTERS is a movie that I've seen well over a hundred times and I'm still not sick of it, nor do I think I ever will. It's an iconic comedy that I think has held up very well over the past 30 years.",
            "If for nothing else, deserves to be fondly remembered for bringing the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man into the world.",
            "An exciting and fun genre hybrid rarely mastered.",
            "Director Ivan Reitman keeps the Aykroyd-Ramis screenplay zipping right along, creating something like Abbott & Costello Meet the Exorcist. Aykroyd and Murray make the perfect summer tonic for raising spirits.",

            "The mix of vulgarity and spirituality, of affectionate freakshow and savage political theater, is pure Jodorowsky, and you can feel his restless invention swirling through every scene.",

            "Goofy, uneven, alternately outrageous and charming (when not both at once), Endless Poetry is as good an introduction to his work as any, and it couldn't have been made by anyone else. ",
            "In its mix of the absurd and the beautiful, Endless Poetry puts into images the sweeping emotions of Jodorowsky's big, beating heart.",
            " It's not endless, but it can often seem insufferable.",

            "What drives [director Stephen] Kijak's film, and adds a universal dimension to a singular band's narrative, is the drama inherent in a group of strong personalities who live for music attempting to create and perform it together.",
            "Good anecdotes - but the film's willingness to indulge the band's rampant self-mythologising can get tiresome.",
            "Watchable and interesting - if a tad worshipful ...",
            "When it comes to chronicling their accomplishments on film, all they have to show for themselves is 90 flashy minutes' worth of rockumentary clich\u00e9s. ",
            "Even if you don't care for the band, Kijak's exuberant style which mirrors the music might win you over.",
            "This high-intensity group - resplendent in the plumage of a Sunset Strip hair band, and playing a kind of prog-metal - delivers the goods. In any language.",
            "Because of its informative avenues, We Are X becomes a fascinating documentary that will appeal to any music fan.",
            "Fascinating for Japanophiles.",
            "Although incredibly successful underdogs, We Are X undeniably grabs its audience and has them rooting for X Japan's final breakthrough.",
            "We Are X does well in showing how X-Japan became famous but like Yoshiki himself, is too mysterious and enigmatic that it keeps the viewer from arm's length, wanting to know more.",
            "X Japan's dedication to music remains admirable but Kijak's film places them on a similar pedestal to that of their swooning fans when it's a closet stashed full of skeletons that would've provided the braver and far more worthwhile material to inspect.",
            "Splits, suicides, a brainwashing cult and industrial quantities of hairspray and make-up all play their part in the story, with the fragile Yoshiki fulfilling the role of tortured artist to perfection.",
            "Much of the film's success comes from the editing of Mako Kamitsuna and John Maringouin who corral a barrage of archival footage, talking heads, observation, and performance into a compelling exploration of one of the world's great rock phenomenons.",
            "A heart-wrenching portrait of a physically and emotionally fragile artist, and the band of equally vulnerable, tormented misfits he assembled around him.",
            "A maddeningly vague primer.",
            "Yoshiki, the group's eccentric co-founder and drummer, gets most of the spotlight. No wonder. He's a real character, a rich and famous delicate dynamo who's also a designer and in constant pain from his art.",
            "The film is a rush, all right, but it's also a soulful look at Yoshiki, who although rarely without his dark glasses, still seems very revealing.",
            "Ultimately, it comes across more like a bonus disc than a feature film.",
            "The creation of capital A Art and the possibility of physical and spiritual salvation via the creative act is the heart and soul of both Kijak's stupendous doc, but man, X just flat out rocks. Prepare to be blown away.",
            "Riveting and exhilarating, We Are X shines an overdue and definitive spotlight on the myth, madness and music of the phenomenon of X Japan, Asia's greatest rock band, that most in the west have yet to discover.",
            "While the movie will not necessarily make you rush out to fill the gaps in your X discography, there is something inspiring about their belief in music.",
            "Invoking the spirit of an epic rock show, \"We Are X\" expresses all the energy, joy and sadness of X Japan's music.",
            "A startlingly intimate portrait of enigmatic X Japan drummer Yoshiki that goes far beyond the typical rock doc.",
            "Nothing you haven't seen before as a music documentary, but it succeeds as an examination of why we turn to escapist art, and what we do when it's no longer there."

            "Guiraudie brings an enigmatic beauty to the physical landscapes and L\u00e9o's spiritual transformation and a sour twist to his satire on artistic purity in a world where wolves pick off the stragglers and loners abandoned to the wilds.",

            "It's a total hoot.",
            "Zootopia pulls together various elements - a neo-noir mystery, a buddy-cop comedy, and timely social themes - into a mostly entertaining animated film. ",
            "The genius of the film lies in its combination of traditional Disney characters and situations with a very subversive storytelling style. ",
            "The film feels like a riposte to Trump-ism. It also contains some of the best sloth-related humour you will ever see.",
            "Zootopia is the rare animated Disney film that feels like it was made for adults almost as much as children.",
            "It's colorful, fun, and has a good message. Will I remember it tomorrow? Probably not, but that doesn't mean I didn't like it today.",
            "Zootopia is a spectacular achievement on every level. It's a big, bold adventure in a remarkably rendered universe steeped in popular culture, a touching story of unlikely friendship, and a sharp critique of modern society. ",
            "The idea of multiculturalism is not acceptance but tolerance[.]",
            "Zootopia is your classic reluctant partners buddy cop flick transposed into family-friendly entertainment ... an intelligent animated film that will resonate with children well into their adulthood.",
            "As entertainment it is a very funny animated film with the fable of Judy, the new heroine of Disney. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "It was complex in its message and yet clear.",
            "Totally adorable and cute.",
            "If you only want to view Zootopia as a cheery little feature cartoon, full of the frolicking anthropomorphic critters Disney excels in creating, it works perfectly well on that level...",
            "Disney weaves in really important issues interlaced with humor, creativity and fun. ",
            "Zootopia is one of Disney's best films to date and my favorite film of the year so far. It's family friendly and teaches kids so many great life lessons.",
            "Disney always strove to base his vision of America on the better angels of our nature, and with Zootopia, the company he founded has succeeded.",
            "There's so much to see, and so many little touches, that those who fall in love with it upon first viewing, and there will be many, will likely come back over and over.",
            "This is an entertaining piece of original animation and the detail, especially of the animal's hair and fur, is pretty spectacular. ",
            "Fresh, clever and squeal-level funny, Zootopia was just as brilliant on second viewing and no doubt will be for repeat ad nausea.",
            "Like the best animated movies it mixes social subtext with genuinely hilarious moments and interesting characters.",
            "A review eviscerating the film would make as much sense as one praising it, so it comes down to a coin-flip judgment call; let's go with the optimistic view that kids hear \"stereotypes and fear of others is bad\" and adults reinforce that message.",
            "\"Zootopia\" includes all the elements of a well-rounded, memorable story that strikes a range of emotional chords. It has lovable characters, witty dialogue, creativity, a great soundtrack and significant themes that resonate with audiences. "

            "Though the crossing storylines don't always work, the characters that populate this harsh but lovely environment pique your interest as L\u00e9o's journey captures your imagination.",
            "Guiraudie frequently abandons the audience in the story - we drift in and out of the narrative just as L\u00e9o drifts in and out of people's lives - but for all of the film's self-infatuation, it also offers no shortage of deeply disturbing show-stoppers.",
            "It's also a film about desire and frustration -- there are sexual relationships between the four main characters in varying permutations that ebb and flow throughout the film.",
            "The largely aimless countryside jaunt that is Staying Vertical is saved from the scrapheap purely because of its intoxicating absurdism.",
            "Confounding and enchanting.",

            "Staying Vertical is a pun that might work in French but in English translates as \"audience indifference.\" That's too bad, because this wild, original film deserves to be seen.",
            "... only in the end does the film establish its own mood: a mixture of the hope of \"The King of Escape\" and the danger of \"Stranger by the Lake.\"",
            "... worth watching for those moments of high provocation, because you're simply not going to see them anywhere else.",
            "The episode brings to Staying Vertical's surface the mild and charming phantasmagoria in which our noncommittal hero seems to float. ",

            "Guiraudie brings an enigmatic beauty to the physical landscapes and L\u00e9o's spiritual transformation and a sour twist to his satire on artistic purity in a world where wolves pick off the stragglers and loners abandoned to the wilds.",

            "Reported parallels with the Marquis de Sade's Justine just don't wash. It's more like Russ Meyer, except the jugs on view aren't as big.",
            "At an epic two hours the stilted dialogue and eye-scorchingly oversaturated film stock threaten to test the patience. But as a self-conscious exercise in kitsch graverobbing, 'Viva' succeeds.",
            "It's the sort of attention to detail that would be admirable in a short film. But in a film that plays out at two hours it's unendurable. Paying ironic homage to bad cinema doesn't suddenly make it good.",
            "Where her film lets itself down, though, is it's simply not funny; you assume that a certain kind of hipster audience may be tickled by all this, but the laughs will be as forced as those that bray out of the screen at all too regular intervals.",
            "The acting is as subtly, drolly bad as it needs to be. The hairpieces and cheesy background muzak compete for the honour of perfect finishing touch. At two hours Viva is a mite too long. But summer is here: give genius its leash.",
            "Filmed in vibrant color with authentic period detail, a salute to old-fashioned exploitation films.",
            "The result is very praiseworthy and each shot in the movie can be framed as a poster. ",
            "Fans of 70s sexploitation films will feel as though they've stepped into a time warp as they observe the impressive production design.",
            "Anna Biller's 1970s-styled sexploitation parody Viva may at times come too close to the real thing, but there's a welcome delight in the film's unapologetic and total submersion into cheap thrills.",
            "You don't need to have seen the movies [Biller is] paying cheeky homage to in order to enjoy Viva. But afterward, you'll probably want to.",
            "Does Viva work if one doesn't get the joke? By and large, yes. It's still full of wonderful characters, there's the occasional quip reminiscent of Russ Meyer at his finest, and the sets are spectacular.",
            "There is barely an out and-out gag - and certainly none that's funny - in the whole two hours of deliberately bad acting.",
            "Viva lasts a staggering two hours (the audience does the staggering) and it doesn't merely end up an embarrassing bore, it gets there within a couple of minutes of the opening.",
            "The plywood acting's pretty funny, as is the coy sex; what amazes is the beautifully lurid, near-fetishistic set design. At two hours, it's an in-joke over-indulged, and it's so camp the camera's practically winking, but minor cultdom beckons.",
            "Great retro design, but as comic satire this isn't so much soft-focus as out of focus.",
            "At two hours it's basically an extended sketch stretched to feature lengh and by the end the vibrancy of the never-seen-in-nature colours are reaching migraine-inducing proportions.",
            "For all its garish aesthetics, sly feminism and wall-to-wall nudity, writer/director Anne Biller's camp-com is almost too much of a good thing, outstaying its welcome at a paint-drying two hours.",
            "Bums and bosoms are in abundance, although there's not enough plot to go around, meaning you'll feel every minute of that two-hour running time.",
            "The film is the cinematic equivalent of greeting cards which poke fun at beehive-haired wives getting slippers for their pipe-smoking husbands, with a rude word inserted in a speech bubble. Not funny.",
            "This is an arch, knowing exercise in cinematic parody where every line of dialogue seems to come with inverted commas. Stretched over two hours it becomes unbearable.",
            "Anna Biller's pastiche of '70s sexploitation flicks finds its G-spot somewhere in the space between past misogyny and present feminism. It's a transgressive joy - if somewhat overlong.",
            "Enjoyably trashy pastiche of 1970s sexploitation movies - the colourful production design, terrible acting and cheesy dialogue are all impeccable, but it's at least 30 minutes too long and isn't as funny as it should have been.",
            "Viva is, without a doubt, the work of an artist, as Anna Biller has crafted a painstakingly brilliant replica of a '70s sexploitation film, with all the pros and cons in place."

            "The movie wears out its welcome long before it meanders to a close at 121 minutes. But as a kinky costume party it's watchable, if only for the smutty sex scenes and Biller's bold pop-art decor.",
            "Reported parallels with the Marquis de Sade's Justine just don't wash. It's more like Russ Meyer, except the jugs on view aren't as big.",
            "The plywood acting's pretty funny, as is the coy sex; what amazes is the beautifully lurid, near-fetishistic set design. At two hours, it's an in-joke over-indulged, and it's so camp the camera's practically winking, but minor cultdom beckons.",
            "At an epic two hours the stilted dialogue and eye-scorchingly oversaturated film stock threaten to test the patience. But as a self-conscious exercise in kitsch graverobbing, 'Viva' succeeds.",
            "It's the sort of attention to detail that would be admirable in a short film. But in a film that plays out at two hours it's unendurable. Paying ironic homage to bad cinema doesn't suddenly make it good.",
            "Where her film lets itself down, though, is it's simply not funny; you assume that a certain kind of hipster audience may be tickled by all this, but the laughs will be as forced as those that bray out of the screen at all too regular intervals.",
            "Filmed in vibrant color with authentic period detail, a salute to old-fashioned exploitation films.",
            "The result is very praiseworthy and each shot in the movie can be framed as a poster. ",
            "Fans of 70s sexploitation films will feel as though they've stepped into a time warp as they observe the impressive production design.",
            "Anna Biller's 1970s-styled sexploitation parody Viva may at times come too close to the real thing, but there's a welcome delight in the film's unapologetic and total submersion into cheap thrills.",
            "You don't need to have seen the movies [Biller is] paying cheeky homage to in order to enjoy Viva. But afterward, you'll probably want to.",
            "Does Viva work if one doesn't get the joke? By and large, yes. It's still full of wonderful characters, there's the occasional quip reminiscent of Russ Meyer at his finest, and the sets are spectacular.",
            "There is barely an out and-out gag - and certainly none that's funny - in the whole two hours of deliberately bad acting.",
            "Viva lasts a staggering two hours (the audience does the staggering) and it doesn't merely end up an embarrassing bore, it gets there within a couple of minutes of the opening.",
            "Great retro design, but as comic satire this isn't so much soft-focus as out of focus.",
            "At two hours it's basically an extended sketch stretched to feature lengh and by the end the vibrancy of the never-seen-in-nature colours are reaching migraine-inducing proportions.",
            "For all its garish aesthetics, sly feminism and wall-to-wall nudity, writer/director Anne Biller's camp-com is almost too much of a good thing, outstaying its welcome at a paint-drying two hours.",
            "Bums and bosoms are in abundance, although there's not enough plot to go around, meaning you'll feel every minute of that two-hour running time.",
            "The film is the cinematic equivalent of greeting cards which poke fun at beehive-haired wives getting slippers for their pipe-smoking husbands, with a rude word inserted in a speech bubble. Not funny.",
            "The acting is as subtly, drolly bad as it needs to be. The hairpieces and cheesy background muzak compete for the honour of perfect finishing touch. At two hours Viva is a mite too long. But summer is here: give genius its leash.",
            "This is an arch, knowing exercise in cinematic parody where every line of dialogue seems to come with inverted commas. Stretched over two hours it becomes unbearable.",
            "Anna Biller's pastiche of '70s sexploitation flicks finds its G-spot somewhere in the space between past misogyny and present feminism. It's a transgressive joy - if somewhat overlong.",
            "Enjoyably trashy pastiche of 1970s sexploitation movies - the colourful production design, terrible acting and cheesy dialogue are all impeccable, but it's at least 30 minutes too long and isn't as funny as it should have been.",
            "Viva is, without a doubt, the work of an artist, as Anna Biller has crafted a painstakingly brilliant replica of a '70s sexploitation film, with all the pros and cons in place."

            "Speaking of comedy, the punches and the Black guy jokes are silly. The action scenes are decent and work to certain extent but the film is avoidable on the whole as it lacks 'intelligence.",
            "The film's deft pace, it's frenzied silliness, punchy wisecracks coupled with the Johnson and Hart's deft handling of the situational comedy holds your interests despite the threadbare plot. ",
            "It helps that he's working with Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, a man-mountain with an unexpected gift for comedy, but the fact is -- I never thought I'd write this -- Hart is emerging as a genuinely funny guy."

            "A masterful study of political and commercial spaces intersecting to the point of personal crisis, Nocturama is one of the boldest creations you're bound to come across. It's also one of the best, because it never wastes a minute of its time.",
            "Rather than profound, Nocturama is almost forgettable.",
            "Inhabits the nihilistic and violent mood of the times.",
            "Part of what's so refreshing about \"Nocturama\" is that it arrives at a time when the Western media assumes that political violence is always linked to Islamic fundamentalism, and TV and films rarely represent the far left...",
            "Although leaving the motivations of the characters to our imagination and fabricating a couple of strained situations that aim to be cool, Nocturama has acceptable moments of suspense and exhales estrangement all around.",
            "The form and the background of Nocturama do not merge, but collide with each other in an outcome that denies us any possible tranquility. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Nocturama works so well because it does not spoon-feed us any answers. In fact, by the film's end, many may be left with more questions than answers. And perhaps that was Bonello's point all along.",
            "... these young people love as much as they despise the world they live in, one of sophisticated materialism, an oppressive system so meticulously designed that it can only be destroyed, completely, by itself. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "At least with regards to what it is composed of, Nocturama is many things.",
            "Bonnello has talent, his views are complex and the film also raises interesting questions. He should be taken very seriously.",
            "The first half is a crisply executed caper thriller of an elaborate, exacting terrorist action undertaken by young adults who seem to have no political ideology beyond a desire to tear it all down...",
            "The film is a carefully constructed hall of mirrors within which Bonello shows us the horror of anger without empathy, and the state as the most terrifying player of all. It is a pitch black allegory for our time."

            "With its foundation in familiar genres like the Western and the Hollywood sports movie, its rhythms will be recognizable to even the most subtitle-averse members of an audience. Tampopo is a movie with little to no cultural barrier.",
            "It is tempting to draw an immediate analogy between the film and ramen... Tampopo is constructed in a similar fashion, with fatty chunks of story and a tangle of narrative noodles, all enlivened by bright spots of spice.",

            "Like a meteor, Complete Unknown shines bright early on but fizzles out when its evolving tone takes one too many left turns. ",
            "This modestly budgeted indie probably wouldn't work as well as it does if not for its two lead performances from Michael Shannon and Rachel Weisz.",

            "Complete Unknown could play out as a gripping mystery or tidy thriller. Instead, the screenplay from Julian Sheppard and director Joshua Marston unfurls as a sedate drawing-room drama.",
            "Complete Unknown may end with a sigh rather than a bang, but it's a sigh you'll still be thinking about days later."

            "The story of a determined quest is always enlivened by insights into the clawing animals, bizarre monsters and sinful humans that populate Bosch's fantastical visions.",
            "Van Huystee doesn't seem terribly interested in the art as art, and yet the power of the works comes through anyway, despite the film's plodding presentation.",
            "For a movie about an artist so unique and provocative, writer-director Pieter van Huystee's documentary \"Hieronymus Bosch: Touched by the Devil\" proves a less-than-scintillating portrait.",
            "Like other recent art-world documentaries, much time is spent on inter-museum wrangling, and the personalities aren't vivid enough ... to build tension. The interest lies in the close look at the strange vision of this great artist.",
            "Hieronymus Bosch: Touched by the Devil is one of the most engrossing documentaries about art and an artist in recent years...",
            "In a way it is van Huystee's camera that is the most compelling character, as it assumes the role of auxiliary team member while simultaneously becoming a careful observer. ",
            "There's just enough close reading of Bosch's work to enthrall those interested with the nuts and bolts of the artist's work, but also plenty to engage those looking for a decidedly more human and modernist element.",
            "Hieronymus Bosch: Touched by the Devil tells a potent story of executive maneuverings and barter but it skimps on the devilry. ",
            "Often less than compelling, lumbering even... In the small details, the huge determination, the teeming world of the canvases, the machinations of \"CSI: Den Bosch\" melt away, all the tidy journalism is immaterial, the up-close examination... transfixes. ",

            "The high-resolution images of Bosch's twisted work are gorgeous, but it's hard not to feel like the doc is a poor substitute for seeing the art in person.",
            "A mostly underwhelming, lethargic doc that leaves you with more questions than answers.",
            "The film offers a true immersion in his artistry. But it's also a little slipshod - an off-kilter window into the politics of the art world. It's like a fascinating magazine feature with some missing pieces.",

            "First-time writer-director Elizabeth Wood's White Girl sets out to be a Great Gatsby for the 21st century - and perhaps in the process, to depict the orgastic future that Fitzgerald mentioned at the story's end.",

            "In \"White Girl,\" you realize that in telling the story of a woman who may overestimate her own power in some respects, Wood, just one film in, is in full command of hers and the result is awesome.",
            "Yes, with its overtly explicit nature this subject matter is bold and has won fans since its Sundance debut, but unfortunately, so many of the directorial choices seemed purely for shock and awe.",
            "Saylor is alternately stiff and extraordinary here, not so great at playing the sober innocent but an ace at the blurry motions of someone who's extremely wasted.",
            "Loosely based on the director's own experience, Wood's viscerally charged film gets under the skin in ways that are hard to shake.",

            "With all the grace and symmetry of a peacock fanning its tail, director Gabriel Mascaro reveals his hand in quixotic blasts of expressionistic color, graphic sensuality, and a few things we've never before seen on film...",
            "The cowboy character would have benefited from a stronger story arc, but Cazarr\u00e9 is quietly charismatic in the role, a Brando-esque figure searching for meaning beyond maschismo.",
            "Mascaro works much like his protagonist, gathering together details, images, and scenes to create unexpected visions. The narrative seems desultory and repetitive until it coalesces into some arresting, if not perverse, sequences.",
            "Visually ravishing and sexually provocative, Neon Bull offers an unforgettable portrait of a changing Brazil, at once earthy and arty.",
            "Securing Gabriel Mascaro laudable international renown, Neon Bull vaunts the director among the frontrunners forming a new generation of phenomenal Brazilian auteurs with this a moody, unpredictable drama.",
            "An incredibly rich, intimate, warm portrait of human desire, jealousy, folly and dreams.",
            "Neon Bull employs the unique routine of rodeos to approach - and subvert - gender stereotypes. ",
            "In its nonjudgmental empathy for people living on the farthest fringes of society, its bleakly epic scope, and its sentimental nihilism, Neon Bull shares a fair amount of DNA with the films of New Hollywood.",
            "It's a mood that combines the real, the surreal, and the banal, and merges them together to make a film that continues to inspire curiosity long after the credits roll.",
            "Neon Bull has the potential to be an engaging film - particularly with the addition of the lead Iremar's subversive interest in costuming. It wastes all of this potential, however.",
            "The film creates a distinct sense of time and place, following the characters into their makeshift domiciles and elaborate corrals that guide each bull toward the arena. ",
            "Even at its most sensational, there's a no-frills naturalism that makes Neon Bull easy to take in.",
            "This is a sad movie then -- albeit its most touching moment comes in the form of a simple hug between two like souls -- but also a very beautiful one. ",
            "The film's many internal frames bring bodies together-sex is in the air-but they also suggest people making do with the fences that are a fact of life.",
            "A film in which its theme isn't expressed in the plot but in its style. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Neon Bull doesn't move viewers toward political consciousness about either animal cruelty or human tenderness. Iremar and his disadvantaged cohorts rouse fascination about beasts (mammals), not human beings or citizens.",
            "The documentary filmmaking background of Brazilian director Gabriel Mascaro informs much of his second dramatic feature, which ventures deep without judgment or undue instigation into the lives of a group of itinerant rodeo workers",

            "Lord know we don't need another biopic of a troubled but brilliant musician, but writer/director Robert Budreau dives into the psychology of a figure like Baker with a depth that such films rarely muster.",
            "After the movie, don't be surprised if you find yourself downloading or streaming his music. If you do you will be struck by the haunting similarities of his sound and those from this very evocative and inventive film.",
            "Born to be Blue is perhaps a too-clever fictionalised take on the life of the jazz trumpeter Chet Baker, although Ethan Hawke's performance as the musician is as compelling as it is painful.",
            "Ethan Hawke puts in a career- best turn as jazz trumpeter Chet Baker in this imaginatively structured biopic.",
            "Touched by resonant tragedies amongst his own friends and learning to play the trumpet for the role, Hawke is compelling, offering a magnetic portrayal of an exasperating but deeply charismatic, engaging figure.",
            "Hawke, who bears at least a modest resemblance to Baker, inhabits the character on a level I've seldom seen from him over the years. ",
            "Thanks to Hawke's painstaking recreation of Baker's ill habits and devoted heart, BORN TO BE BLUE is able to eclipse its musical biopic bandmates.",
            "There's a plethora of jazz biopics around. This one leaves you with a feeling of unfulfilled promise, both in the life it portrays and in itself.",
            "Hawke is very good here. I'm not his biggest fan, but he gets Baker's distinctive, whispery voice, whether speaking or singing.",
            "Presenting a career-best performance from Ethan Hawke, Born to Be Blue earns its place as one of the best jazz movies to grace the screen.",
            "It all works because of Hawke and Ejogo.",
            "The movie is slight but silly, goofy without being goony.",
            "Robert Budreau's Born to be Blue dares to blur the lines between fact and fiction.",
            "There are moments when Ethan Hawke's performance as Baker strikes just the right note of fragile, demon-haunted vulnerability. But these moments are set in a larger story that takes too long to get going, and too often loses its way",
            "I hope Born to Be Blue sends audiences back to that Baker song and his other great jazz.",
            "Blue may not be the most complete portrait of the artist, but its sumptuous images and sensitive performances provide a rough sketch to entertain devotees and neophytes alike.",
            "Director Robert Budreau's style is ... controlled, bathing the characters in blue light, placing them in cool yellow and blue surroundings, and keeping the camera much more still ... It's a fitting aesthetic for his story. ",
            "What makes Born to be Blue a special film is the phenomenal performance of Ethan Hawke as the addled, wounded Baker.",
            "For casual fans or people who have yet to encounter Baker, Born To Be Blue is a good place to start, perfectly encapsulating the fragility and self-destructive urges that underlined his uniquely beautiful and melancholic music.",
            "Writer-director Robert Budreau takes a stylised approach to this biopic of the legendary jazz artist Chet Baker, combining the achingly soulful music with an equally resonant performance from Ethan Hawke.",
            "For all its deviations from biographical fact, Born to be Blue does finally capture something that is inescapably there on the records (and in that loaded title): the melancholy that, like the music, was forever in Baker's blood.",
            "Whispery and jazzy and niche market, it is hooked around an excellent performance from Hawke.",
            "As Baker, Ethan Hawke is intensely committed -- subtly conveying a complex mix of frailty and arrogance -- and there is strong work from Ejogo as well as Callum Scott Rennie as Baker's long-suffering ally, Pacific Jazz Records founder Dick Bock."

            "Engaging and witty tale of girlie bonding let down by a clunky third act.",

            "All at once a sensitive coming-of-age drama, a mildly implausible abduction thriller and a bittersweet love letter to Liverpool, Heymann's film plays like This Is England for the celebrity-obsessed Noughties.",
            "Look for your kicks elsewhere.",

            "'Trumpland' becomes a passionate case not for voting against Donald Trump but for Hillary Clinton.",
            "Michael Moore is trying to do something almost no one of his ilk is doing: He's actually talking to the other side, trying to appeal to their better natures. ",
            "Somewhat surprisingly, despite the atypical nature of the film among Moore's filmography, this feature does a great job of highlighting the filmmaker's strengths and weaknesses more clearly than any of his more traditional documentaries.",
            "The end goal is most assuredly to secure votes for Hillary Clinton, but the more affecting plea of Moore's movie is a cry for basic human compassion.",
            "His ungainly presentation and shaky arguments make for an uneven polemic that never takes fire, even when doused in gasoline.",
            "It's a plea for the election of Hillary Clinton, delivered with a combination of rousing earnestness and shaky optimism.",
            "Michael Moore in TrumpLand is the funniest thing that the controversial documentarian has made in years.",
            "More notable for the stealth with which it was produced than its content, Michael Moore in TrumpLand is less a movie than a filmed concert by someone who is more accomplished as a showman than a stage performer.",
            "What begins as an earnest attempt to reach across the aisle turns into an unofficial Clinton campaign ad.",
            "Older, un-messianic, and mostly eschewing cute stunts, Moore somehow makes his one-man show seem almost humble. It plays less like \"I'm still here!\" attention-seeking than it does a concerned citizen's act of hope.",
            "[Moore is] an excellent weaver of outrages and injustices, cruel ironies and boggling oversights, when given the space to build a tapestry. That sprawl and style is missed in TrumpLand, which has a hasty, scattered feel to it."

            "The genius of Under the Shadow lies in the way it builds up the tension: slowly, almost imperceptibly at first, until I suddenly realized I was wound so tightly I wanted to scream.",
            "The shift from family drama to djinn game is so subtle as to be barely perceived",
            "Under the Shadow is skillful and scary enough to be a legitimate niche hit.",
            "Intimate horror about the dark things lurking in a family home, and, more interestingly, in the minds of women.",
            "Under the Shadow cannily uses a fairly standard, if also expertly staged, ghost story to obsess over a character-driven story arc involving issues of marriage, motherhood, religious fundamentalism and feminism.",
            "Under the Shadow is a skillful slow burn of a movie, intermixing quiet, suggestively stacked details with an increasing number of unsettling shocks. ",
            "Under the Shadow has all of the makings of a new horror classic: a compelling protagonist to root for, a unique setting and mythology, visceral and psychological terror, and creepy, effective monsters. ",
            "Much like last year's A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night, this a proudly, culturally authentic Iranian horror movie that... establishes itself in the horrifying reality of a real-world conflict.",
            "First and foremost, this is a well-directed horror movie that has just the right mix of atmosphere and old-fashioned scares to delight the mainstream audiences. When you look deeper, though, there are treats for cinephiles to unpack. ",
            "Encompasses many experiences and situations of women worldwide, and what living under the constant, forceful pressure of patriarchy can do to their psyches.",
            "Under the Shadow comes from a dark place. Firmly in the shade of the Cultural Revolution and deep into the Iran-Iraq War, the spectre of war and threat of tragedy looms large over what is, in essence, a stressful domestic drama.",
            "Under the Shadow is tense, unusual and well worth seeing, with mainstream appeal. It's a must-see even for non-horror fans.",
            "[Babak Anvari] makes masterful use of a time and place that is a hotbed of extreme self-righteousness, where something as basic as a woman's education and choice of clothing are under the microscope.",
            "This fantastic directorial debut is one of the essential foreign language works of the year - and further proof that 2016 is the greatest year for horror cinema in my lifetime.",
            "Under the Shadow gives you a glimpse into the old and new aspects of Iranian culture, while also giving you a fright you won't soon forget. ",
            "Under the Shadow shows that horror is still alive and well in cinema and not only do I hope that Iran does more genre films, I really hope it brings Iranian cinema out of the shadows and into the mainstream.",
            "A timeless story about accepting the mistakes of our past...This is absolutely one of 2016's must-see films, horror or otherwise.",
            "An old school chiller, Under The Shadow offers more than just the usual scares. An interesting and welcome entry into the foreign language ghost story.",
            "It's anthropological, feminist, and historical. In short, it's excellent in ways few horror films are.",
            "Under the Shadow simulates this discomfort and, when the world (and the rules that govern it) begins to unravel in the film's final act, the result is terrifying.",
            "This is a must see and shows Iranian filmmaking just keeps producing excellent, thought provoking films. A proper psychological supernatural thriller with a good narrative and under 1hr 30 mins in length.",
            "It is clear that the oppression of the Cultural Revolution is stifling, especially towards women, but when the materialized djinn resembles a flying, haunted hijab, that message is now shouted at the audience loudly.",
            "Under the Shadow is a balancing act of great dynamics, great scares, and is one of the best horror films to have come along in a while."

            "This film tells two stories, both fascinating. Morrison's purposeful editing and story sense make Frozen Time a mesmerizing tale",

            "The film moves at a stately pace, but that just makes it cumulative effect all the more powerful. Time had its way with Dawson City as it has its way with the rest of the world, but there's much to learn, and beauty to see, in what's been left behind.",
            "Bill Morrison, whose extraordinary documentary Decasia turned decomposing film stock into the stuff of avante-garde reverie, returns with another staggering journey into the past.",

            "A story of fire and ice; silver and gold",
            "If cinema is the place where dreams meet reality, then Dawson City: Frozen Time is a cinematic reverie that takes us on a mesmerizing and deeply moving journey through history",
            "A stunning work of curation from documentary filmmaker Morrison, a story of fortune, folly, film and fire preserved in permafrost.",
            "A captivating portrait of a place which once found itself at the centre of history.",
            "So much more than just a lesson in Dawson City's own history, and extending further still than the bounds of film history, Morrison's approach to archive film offers us an experience of the past that is unwaveringly contemporary. ",
            "[Morrison's] tribute to Dawson City and the resting places of these memories is done, and it's done well.",
            "An important work that demands a place in film school syllabuses the world over. And if I had seen it in that context I probably would have given it a higher score.",
            "Dawson City: Frozen Time may sound like a time capsule on paper, but it's something altogether more profound in motion. ",
            "The film is transfixing, an utterly singular compound of the bizarre, the richly informative, the thrilling, the horrifying, the goofy, the tragic, and the flat-out gorgeous.",
            "Morrison's work of passion, almost fully of archival footage, is interesting but exhausting as a work of preservation.",
            "An epic presentation of history, film history, and film as history all in one ... if you care about film at all, you have to see this miraculous documentary.",
            "... celebrates the power of cinema as a time capsule and features clips of numerous films recovered in Dawson to help tell the story of the city and to illustrate the wonders of the world that cinema brought to the citizens in the 1910s and 1920s ...",
            "...an act of resurrection and transformation."

            "A potent reminder of the unseen threats that face the world today. You'll need a stiff drink after, but that shouldn't discourage you from seeking out this sobering, powerful, and absolutely vital film.",

            "If not for its setting, the Israeli horror film Jeruzalem would be just another video verite, found-footage, would-be scarefest with little to make it unique...There's just not much scare there.",
            "As impressive as the Old City locations can be, one narrow alleyway looks much like another when the Paz brothers' camera is bouncing to and fro. Not much substance is buried beneath the irritating style.",

            "The movie's occasional stabs at political commentary never quite pay off. Nor can the writer-directors, brothers Yoav and Doron Paz, fully sustain the film's novelty into the second half, when the script reverts to timeless, tired monster-movie tropes.",

            "The film is crisp, and does not stray away from its USP at any point - its emotional connection with us, the audience. ",
            "Why does Saala Khadoos fail to land the knockout punch in spite of getting a few hooks and upper cuts right? Despite the many promising situations that it rustles up, there is little room in the well-intentioned yet rough-hewn drama for genuine surprises.",
            "Avoid this grumpy drama if you are looking for a good sports film. If you must, watch it for Madhavan's power-packed performance.",
            "Madhavan is good as the cynical coach who wants nothing more than to earn his stripes. Ritika is raw yet manages a knockout performance. Nasser, Mumtaz and Zakir lend good support.",
            "Saala Khadoos is actually a love story, but there is enough boxing here for fans of the sport. The title refers to the attitude of its rude coach, but the movie belongs to his headstrong pupil.",
            "It's feisty, boisterous and spirited just like any revered sporting champion.",
            "Much like its title character, who often flares up for no reason, Saala Khadoos is a lot of hot air and not much else."

            "Such a scenario is provocative in an age of technological overload, but the screenplay turns into a muddled mood piece rather than capitalizing on its inherent urgency.",
            "Into the Forest may get lost in the glut of post-apocalyptic films... If that's the case, it'll be a shame, for this adaptation of Jean Hegland's gently sci-fi novel is a more intimate film than many of those zombie-busters and doomsday thrillers. ",

            "While the comedic bits tend to play into David's personal life, they momentarily uplift the feature but overall, it is not enough to raise the spirits of his character, nor this feature.",
            "The film finds an emotionally resonant blend of tragedy and comedy that packs a wallop of as the story of a cancer-stricken mother (Molly Shannon, better than ever) reaches its inevitable end.",

            "Cathartic documentation of a year in David's life, a beautiful tribute to mother-son bonds from Plemons, and an upsettingly credible Shannon.",

            "The countless devoted fans of Nimoy and his character virtually guarantee that For the Love of Spock will live long and prosper.",

            "For The Love of Spock honors the life of Leonard Nimoy in a very well-made documentary.",

            "Occasionally threatens to become an overly glossy offering of hero worship, but it retains a degree of honesty, making sure to identify the man before the Vulcan.",
            "For the Love of Spock is a bittersweet yet eminently intriguing profile of a man who ultimately did live long and, yes, prosper.",

            "There is a lot to process here, and a film of ideas is always commendable, and even if its parts don't always add up, T\u00e9chin\u00e9 imbues it with a wise and lyrical grace.",
            "We don't come close to understanding Jeanne's very particular choice of fabricated victimization, and T\u00e9chin\u00e9, erring too much on the side of enigma, doesn't seem to, either.",
            "Understated but involving, The Girl On The Train tells a very personal and specific story that resonates with wider insight into the state of modern France.",
            "It's an interesting approach, avoiding didactic hand-wringing in favour of elliptical character drama...",
            "The film's complex political and social themes are frustratingly simplified, reducing events to bare-bones implausibility and making empathy hard despite the impressively subtle performances.",

            "Techine once again displays a masterful control ofall aspects of his movie, a typically rich character study.",
            "\u00c9milie Dequenne projects little in the lead; neither her passion nor her foolhardy decision to draw attention by claiming the mantle of victimhood convinces.",
            "Although this stylish and ominously paced vehicle starts with a full itinerary, it never makes a vital connection.",
            "A character study par excellence, that simmers and lingers and reveals itself only by inches.",
            "Perhaps the most prominent characters in the film are the trains themselves. They keep roaring past and taking the camera into dark tunnels, a ubiquitous, vaguely malignant presence.",
            "T\u00e9chin\u00e9's choice of zag over zig succeeds in upending the audience's expectations, although it's not clear to what end.",

            "The film inserts us into a solipsistic universe of Norman Lear, one that also overlaps many of the most significant social, political, and show-biz issues of the second half of the 20th century.",
            "The film is a little slow going in the beginning... But the story of his childhood, service in the military, how he got into show business, creations and collaborations and his marriages include fascinating details.",
            "The film showcases Lear's talent without eulogizing him, presenting a warts-and-all take that still manages to highlight the remarkable vitality that this iconic TV man still exudes.",
            "Watching this documentary is not only a fascinating exploration of one of television's greatest artists, but a potent reminder of how deeply engaged we have been with this mode of storytelling.",
            "The film is most successful when showing the genesis of Lear's greatest works.",
            " The picture doesn't find precision, but it summarizes nicely, delivering a fascinating portrait of a man who changed television.",
            "As a portrait of a genius, Norman Lear: Just Another Version of You is a pleasant enough historical primer on what was the best part of television in the 1970s.",
            "Their subject is just too smart, interesting and philosophically astute to not be fascinating. But you crave more, and as Archie Bunker would fondly say, \"That's the crutch of the situation.\" ",

            "Lear was a TV pathfinder, all right, but his path is carpeted with rose petals.",
            "The film is at its most compelling when we hear Lear's voice - or just watch him, seated on a theatrically lit but empty stage, thumbing through scrapbooks and smiling or wincing at memories.",
            "Lear is clearly a pretty great guy and one hell of a writer, but some more exploration into what makes Lear and his work tick would go a long way.",
            "A fine, celebratory introduction into the career of Lear ...",
            "An alternately penetrating and poignant portrait of a true trailblazer!",
            "The film is by no means a waste, especially for those who don't already know Lear's accomplishments. It's an undeniable treat to see a lively, vulnerable Lear on screen willing and eager to bring his storytelling wisdom to his life story.",
            "Despite the occasionally intrusive bouts of visual artiness...an engaging portrait of a likable and influential player in television history."

            "At once a throwback to so many of the off-kilter Australian films of the '70s and '80s and a declaration of a promising new voice, Girl Asleep doesn't always hold together...But that's all part of the film's adventurous appeal.",
            "\"Girl Asleep\" isn't easy to categorize. It's a wild curiosity that shifts on a whim. In that sense, there couldn't be a better metaphor for the inner workings of a teenage girl's mind.",

            "I hope Myers and Whittet make more movies. Maybe it's best to consider this one just practice.",

            "Girl Asleep, a whimsical, beautiful Australian film, manages to fit all those concerns - social hierarchy, vicious teasing, the landscape of a creative young mind - into just 77 minutes.",
            "... the film stands out thanks to an aggressive visual language, with a marked seventies aesthetic that refers to the films of Wes Anderson... [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Girl Asleep offers a surrealist world that's as magical as it is heartfelt.",
            "Quirky coming-of-age fantasy has cursing, sex. ",
            "Lovely, quirky, highly stylised left-field Aussie comedy set in the 1970s about adolescent awkwardness, peer pressure and the importance of throwing a killer party.",
            "It takes us into Greta's head through her dreams and thoughts.",
            "Overall, this is a delightful film from an exciting new voice in Australian cinema and, even better, it offers teenagers a refreshing take on adolescence.",
            "This isn't the polished product it might have been, but it's ambitious and creative and it succeeds in standing out.",
            "Highly creative work from Rosemary Myers, and while she hasn't mastered tonal changes, she's beginning a promising career with this endearingly oddball movie.",
            "If Napoleon Dynamite was cast as the lead in \"Where the Wild Things Are\" - and if he was a 14-year-old Australian girl, the result might be something like the inventive coming-of-age comedy \"Girl Asleep.\"",
            "does a fine job getting to the heart of what it means to turn 15 and not fit in",
            "Rosemary Myers' wonderful Girl Asleep is a modern fairy tale -- if a story set in the 1970s can qualify as \"modern.\"",
            " ...despite [Myers'] film's stage origins, it's obvious she's been cinematically inspired, most notably by Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman",
            "The movie does stay on the right side of the charm/smarm divide.",
            "As it seesaws between Greta's conscious and unconscious minds, the movie begins to feel like a waking dream.",
            "Girl Asleep is wall-to-wall quirky, frequently very funny, and occasionally hints at the actual horror of being an adolescent girl in a pretty compelling way.",
            "From the overtly vibrant colors to the caricaturesque dimensions of the performances, the film's aesthetic promises a great allegorical message that never arrives.",
            "Despite its stabs at an original narrative, these filmmakers ... have yet to find their own voice."

            "IN A VALLEY OF VIOLENCE isn't as invested in the actual gunslinging violence as it is in the dialogue leading up to the confrontations. Don't be mistaken, while West's work lets the tension build the pay-off here is worthwhile. ",
            "A corn-fed, all-American, organically certified Western. ",
            "The mix of humor and horror shouldn't surprise those who have followed the director, but it's exciting to see West work so hard to upend any expectations audiences may have of him.",
            "While it certainly doesn't break any new ground in the genre its spur-laden boots are treading, it's still a fun little throwback of showdowns on dirt roads between grizzled men out for vengeance.",

            "It isn't quite as deep or clever as West's past efforts, but as a no-frills approximation of bottom-of-the-card-on-a-triple-bill drive-in fare goes, it does the trick.",
            "The plot itself is fairly straightforward, which makes the just over 2 hour film feel longer than it actually is. ",
            "West shows the film industry and fans alike what is possible when stereotypes become broken and one challenges himself creatively.",
            "There's a streak of darkly funny absurdity running through the film as well, not least in the climactic in-the-street showdown, which finds John Travolta's wooden-leg-toting marshal caught awkwardly in the middle when the bullets start to fly.",
            "Typical western with some shrill women.",
            "In a Valley of Violence may ultimately present an unflattering view of humanity, but West bracingly restores the compassion that even Tarantino himself seems to have let slip through his grasp in his own recent Westerns.",
            "It seems that West's quirkiness involves no point at all, other than to create a familiar setting, throw a bunch of idiots together, and watch them act out their violent tendencies to somewhat predictable ends.",

            "Survivors give gripping accounts of events, while journalist Eric Schlosser (on whose book the documentary is based) explains that the risks of an accidental nuclear-weapon explosion have always been much higher than we imagined.",
            "As a child, I worried about nuclear war. It never occurred to me that I should have been worried about a nuclear accident.",
            "The inescapable conclusion is that we have more to fear from our own human error than from our enemies' malevolence. ",
            "There's an important story to tell here, one about the risks created by the very people and things we employ to keep us secure, but not enough to fill the 92-minute runtime.",
            "A terrifying documentary that'll have your heart racing as fast as any Hollywood thriller, Kenner's film reveals that, due to a range of errors and accidents, we were very close, more than once, to detonating a nuke on our own soil.",
            "Lots of documentaries these days will tell you to be afraid, to be very afraid, but few will scare you as coolly and as convincingly as \"Command and Control.\"",
            "Meticulously crafted and deeply disturbing, Command and Control is as riveting as any fictional thriller - more so because of its chilling implications for the future.",
            "These are the things of which nightmares are made.",
            "A film that's as close to a white-knuckle thrill ride as talking head documentaries will probably ever get.",
            "(PODCAST) This well researched and expertly executed documentary is essential viewing for understanding a potentially world-ending pervasive threat facing America.",
            "Command and Control is one heck of a deadly doomsday scenario.",
            "Robert Kenner's compelling and tense documentary Command and Control... looks at the danger arguably more basic and constant than that of nuclear war in the mere deployment of nuclear weapons in supposedly safe stateside locations.",
            "Command and Control is a gripping account of what happens when things don't \"work perfect\" at a nuclear-weapons site.",
            "The film uses a minute-by-minute account to the Damascus incident as the backbone of a story about what can happen when human beings are expected to perform even simple tasks perfectly 100 percent of the time.",
            "A suitable subject for a nail-biter fictional thriller, but it's a documentary.",
            "Sleep well, America!",
            "Morbid, apocalyptic yet enthralling.",
            "The statistical probability of a nuclear accident increases every moment. Humankind has been lucky so far, which Command and Control makes poignantly clear.",
            "\"Command and Control\" may not be overwhelming work, but as a critical reminder of the fallibility of men around doomsday devices, it's terrifying. ",
            " The meat of Kenner's story is the heroics of the Air Force technicians who risked their lives. It adds a personal touch that immensely humanizes a story that could easily get lost in the minutia. ",
            "Proceeds like a real-life thriller, one with striking parallels to its narrative contemporary Deepwater Horizon.",
            "Kenner and Schlosser not only remind us of a danger that never went away, but honor the men whose bravery was never recognized.",
            "In case it has slipped your mind, Robert Kenner's doc is here to remind us that nuclear technology inspired the very acme of human scientific stupidity and arrogance.",
            "\"Command and Control\" has a strong anti-nuclear bomb vibe as it shows the confusion of those responsible for taking care of our nuclear arsenal."

            "Every single segment in Holidays is of a certain quality and every single one holds your attention. Some are just more refined and impactful than others.",
            "Some of the films are haunting, some of them more macabre, but all of them play with holiday symbolism in way that will make viewers rethink a lot of their favorite celebrations.",
            "\"Holidays\" is frustrating because its creators all have something good going for them, but almost consistently have no ideas of what to do.",
            "The film mostly feels perfunctory and awkward - like calling home at Christmas.",
            "Like a family dinner with an eccentric uncle, Holidays' quirkiness is fitfully entertaining, but ultimately exhausting.",

            "Some of the stories feel a little underdeveloped and others only have tangential relation to their respective holiday, but they're all at least interesting to watch.",

            "A series of stupid, baffling, and pointless horror segments that go nowhere...",

            "It's a middle-of-the-road anthology but boasts great energy and a sense of humor that runs throughout, helping make even the mediocre entries watchable.",
            "Holidays is not worth celebrating.",
            "Holidays has one story that's a dud, two that are okay but would have been better longer, and five that are solid. That's more than enough for a recommendation.",

            "The film is a strong debut from a talented writer and director to watch.",
            "A film that explains the Arab Spring better than any documentary. My pick for the best foreign film of 2016 for now. I doubt that anything will surpass it.",
            "An engaging, personal take on an event that must be close to Bouzid's heart, As I Open My Eyes should open your eyes, too and is well worth seeing.",
            "Despite the constant arguments between Farah and her mother, their relationship remains the closest, warmest and the most touching feature of the entire film.",
            "This debut feature earns its grown-up wisdom without selling out its youthful idealism.",
            "Leyla Bouzid displays considerable talent for dramatizing how young people eroticize peril and risk due to a lack of experience.",
            "Director Leyla Bouzid is keenly observant; she understands the scariness of exerting one's independence.",
            "The combative but loving mother/daughter relationship which starts as the subplot and gradually takes over is unexpectedly compelling by the melancholy older-but-wiser end.",
            "A headstrong young woman in Tunisia bucks her parents and her repressive society in Leyla Bouzid's impressive debut."

            "A bland and generic action flick, not just forgettable after the fact, but during.",
            "Tom Cruise's latest action spectacular is so dull that I found myself willing on the baddies.",
            "Admittedly, it's also a touch flavour-free, but it applies itself to telling its story single-mindedly, with a minimum of digression and frills.",
            "The understated ending is downright touching -- which is not something I ever thought I'd say of a Cruise action sequel.",
            "A solid enough popcorn flick.",
            "Jack Reacher: Never Go Back isn't exactly lazy, but every element is too easy, unambitious, and the whole package leaves the lingering impression that no one involved except Tom Cruise cares.",
            "Although not outstanding, the fight and chase sequences are entertaining enough to leave a good taste in your mouth. [Full review in Spanish] ",
            "I was moderately devastated how bland Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is.",
            "If there is another Jack Reacher movie, we can only hope that it embraces its airport thriller roots. For what it's worth, I'll never go back to Never Go Back.",

            "Perhaps my affinity for the character blinds me to the film's greater flaws, but maybe it also mediates against reflexive film critic cynicism.",
            "It's the sort of force-of-nature hero that Cruise loves to play, but the unfortunate truth is that the sequel even more than the decent but uneven first film heaps the engagement burden almost entirely on Cruise's shoulders.",
            "A solid, whodunit crime mystery thriller.",
            "Cobie Smulders definitely holds her own in this film, and is a delight to watch on screen. With the success of her role in the Avengers films, I am glad to see she is broadening her action portfolio.",
            "Instead of becoming a syndicated TV vehicle for whoever the present-day equivalent of Kevin Sorbo or Lorenzo Llamas is, somebody decided that this needed to be a movie franchise for Tom Cruise.",
            "Edward Zwick seems out of his element in making a pure action movie, which goes a long way to explain why the bone-shattering punches of Reacher don't seem to land with the same impact as last time.",
            "Jack Reacher: Never Go Back does just about enough to remain an engaging watch, but it's nothing that demands the cinematic experience.",
            "The real display of skill here is in maintaining a tone that allows for some jokes while letting us care somewhat about the outcome.",
            "It's a cable watch, at best.",
            "This thing is a bad movie, and it sucks that it wasted one of the all-time movie stars we have left."

            "Deliciously [mixes] genres from domestic comedy to teen horror/fantasy.",
            "Stephen Dunn has in fact crafted an instant classic of queer cinema that takes the coming-of-age and coming-out tale, rejuvenates it and delivers a film that unapologetically puts the elephant in the room in its very title.",
            "Closet Monster is a little obvious with its symbolism... However, [Stephen] Dunn stylistically pulls off the movie's themes beautifully.",
            "Closet Monster is certainly worth a watch due to its originality, quirkiness and honesty, none of which ever seem forced. ",
            "[An] absolutely stunning queer coming-of-age story.",
            "With its surrealist treatment of gay identity and hothouse take on familial melodrama, Closet Monster inevitably feels like a precious carbon copy of Xavier Dolan's work. ",

            "It's nothing less than an emotional exorcism.",
            "The determined eccentricity of the entire conceit-liberally laced with moments of hallucinatory surrealism-weighs the movie down, creating an airless ambiance at odds with any youthful verve which might appeal to the viewer.",
            "Closet Monster is most successful when it uses fable-like qualities to allow us to feel Oscar's emotions viscerally rather than narratively.",
            "A most auspicious debut.",
            "Connor Jessup wonderfully inhabits the teenage Oscar, who observes others while trying to find himself. Aaron Abrams, as his father, and Aliocha Schneider and Sofia Banzhaf, as friends, are just as multilayered.",
            "It wouldn't work at all if the filmmaker hadn't lucked into an actor as gifted as Jessup.",
            "It's when Stephen Dunn dares to inhabit the how and not the what of queerness that the film feels authentic and deliciously strange. ",
            "[The film's] trajectory might be obvious and on a well-tread path, but the way it unfolds is wholly unique in its theatrical language."

            "(Green's) work is so precise it might feel mathematical, but the effect is anything but, especially when open-faced actors like Rongione and R\u00e9gnier are staring soulfully into the camera.",
            "[An] uproarious and touching coming-of-age farce.",
            "The Son of Joseph shows bemused conservatism in its challenge to the current period of social and political hostility that turns people against one other - as if we were all fatherless renegades.",
            "There's a lightness to Green's touch, and a gentle beauty to many of his images, that redeems its flaws and even courts the sublime.",
            "There's more obvious method behind Green's madness than the majority of directors currently working the art house/film festival circuit.",
            "Like all of Green's works, this film seeks to show the transcendence in everyday life through austere planning. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "\"The Son of Joseph\" is more accessible than usual - the gateway film you'd recommend to a Eugene Green newb, though it's no sell-out. ",
            "Son of Joseph is an unquestionably smart, good-looking film, but I appreciate it more than I enjoyed it.",
            "The passionate heart of the action, Vincent's quest for emotional connection, involves his radical rejection of norms and proprieties and sparks the timeless fury of revolt; it's as thrilling as it is ingenious."

            "Too often lately Robinson has been the best part of meh movies.",
            "A well-crafted work that features a powerful performance by former child actor Nick Robinson (Jurassic World), Being Charlie is far too predictable, relying too often on all-too-familiar drug-story tropes.",
            "Better remembered as the vehicle to healing for the family than a movie that made an impact.",
            "The film's great disappointment: that something so clearly conceived in earnestness and from real-life, first-person experience ends up feeling, well, kinda fake.",
            "There's something admirable about the fact that \"Being Charlie\" exists at all. It's a testament to Nick Reiner's survival. That doesn't mean it's a great movie.",
            "In the end, \"Being Charlie\" feels like a first draft of a story that's still in progress.",
            "\"Being Charlie\" tries to cover several aspects...but the lines are not connected enough for it to have any kind of substantial emotional effect on the audience.",
            "Competent yet perpetually uninvolving...",
            "Yes, there's hugging at the end, but there's also no sugarcoating the truth about drugs.",
            "You might even want to forgive the many times it goes off the rails, falling back on the stock cliches it seemed too cool to perpetuate.",
            "Mature depiction of young, self-defeating addict.",
            "When it's merely observing, Being Charlie refuses to offer simple answers. [The] subplots do just the opposite.",
            "Well-intended and capably made, I suspect that \"Being Charlie\" will find utility in rehab circles. ",
            "\"Being Charlie\" is saved by Nick Robinson's natural and appealing performance in the lead role..",
            "Nothing in Rob Reiner's well-intentioned, cautionary domestic drug drama feels authentic, genuine or sincere.",
            "Being Charlie wants to make one addict's problems at once light and substantial but fails by confusing these two conflicting approaches.",
            "Even as enlightenment occurs, Charlie is still mostly a guy you want to punch in the face.",
            "Complete with a long, pensive walk along the oceanfront, the film falls into well-worn devices found in many coming-of-age stories, but it's not without charmed performances.",
            "A 97 minute slog to a conclusion we see coming in minute one.",
            "I respect that this was a personal passion project for Reiner, and that he says it helped him better understand his son. Sadly, that has not translated into a good movie. ",
            "Being Charlie is a deeply personal Reiner affair that stings with honesty that's felt through tremendous performances.",
            "The result is a film so personal you watch transfixed, caught up in a life that is constantly enthralling, with a universal appeal that extends beyond the exclusive Hills of Beverly.",
            "Like most family affairs, the film isn't perfect but it is memorable, and provides a passable high when it is over-one that you haven't felt from a Rob Reiner production in ages.",
            "Buoyed by some nice performances, but it's too full of on-the-nose messages and platitudes to be appealing."

            "A 115-minute film hewed from some 40 hours of footage shot over a period of several months, No Home Movie has a sense of Warholian acceptance. ",
            "Long shots of barren landscapes and domestic nothingness are punctured, in true Akerman style, with momentary eruptions of pain, poignancy and, most of all, love.",
            "It's not hard to imagine having a hostile reaction to this piece of work, so convincing is it in giving the impression of being tossed off that anyone not paying attention might overlook its calm control and the deep core of pain hidden in plain sight.",
            "The shooting style will drive many people to distraction (a four-minute opening shot of a bush, for instance, is a killer). But as an essay on motherhood, memory and the looming shadow of loss, it's close to exquisite.",
            "We'll miss you, Chantal.",
            "Chantal Akerman's final film has almost unbearable poignancy and melancholy ...",
            "From her revolutionary depiction of real-time onscreen to her almost voyeuristic style of shooting her own life, No Home Movie epitomizes every quality that made Chantal Akerman's cinema so groundbreaking.",
            "The key to Ackerman's work is in the duration of her shots. ",
            "The scenes lack context and therefore emotional resonance, even if the film's fly-on-the-wall verisimilitude has a kind of mesmerizing quality.",
            "For a subject so deeply ingrained with sorrow, the punishing and purposely tedious nature of No Home Movie's structure feels entirely earned -- even imperative.",
            "Both elliptical and tryingly quotidian, No Home Movie is a shattering contemplation of loss and grief as much as it is a search for identity and calm... ",
            "... the director's need for her subject carries an almost physical throb. Natalia is so richly anticipated in every patiently wrought, exquisitely framed tableau that her actual arrival within each one is almost beside the point.",
            "[Chantal Akerman] assumed audiences would share her interests-and they did.",
            "No Home Movie remains a loving tribute, sure to stand the test of time.",
            "Deliberately uneventful and domestic, it's a fiercely private piece given extra poignancy by Akerman's own death last year.",
            "Akerman may have been left with questions about existence that she herself couldn't answer, but she asked them beautifully, often painfully, and we are privileged to be able to continue searching along with her timeless, powerful images.",
            "The ingredients look so simple and raw as to be trash, but the film made from them is a piercing, precious, and sad depiction of the human craving for family and contact.",
            "Chantal Akerman's final film is both a tribute to a dying mother and the last testament of a director who would take her own life just months after the premiere, aged 65.",
            "This is not an easy film to watch but its power and poignancy are only increased by the circumstances in which it was made.",
            "It's impossible not to be sucked into Akerman's final film.",
            "Long episodes of helpless tedium interspersed with brief moments of intense heartbreak.",
            "While not a sequel to [Chantal Akerman's 1977] News from Home in any real shape or form, No Home Movie nonetheless returns to these themes of abandonment, loneliness, detachment, and familial angst.",
            "Akerman ... is her own best spokesperson as she discusses her films at locations where they were shot.",
            "It's almost unbearably sad, but the deep affection and connection Akerman has for her subject thrums through every scene, even the ones in which they speak on Skype, Akerman from different locations around the world."

            "Perhaps the scariest thing about it is the realization that if the fate of the world depends on well-meaning issue docs, then we really are doomed.",
            "What separates... Time to Choose from the many other documentaries about climate change is that, after dutifully presenting many of the usual horrifying climate statistics, it lays out a series of possible solutions, already available, to the crisis.",
            "What elevates \"Time to Choose,\" other than its very strong editing by Beck, is the sense that not only are people doing something to change the trajectory of our planet's depleted resources but that you can make a difference too.",
            "A film that shapes and alters your perceptions.",
            "Ferguson portrays the climate struggle as a winnable war, but also a titanic one, pitting a small, greedy plutocracy against the rest of the world's citizens.",
            "This is a well researched piece on climate change that graphically shows changes that need to be addressed and soon! ",
            "Positing \"smart technologies\" as the existing and cost-efficient solution, Time to Choose drives the message home.",
            "Climate-change doc is visually beautiful but oversimplified.",
            "An imperative, essential essay on our climate change crisis, and if it ever feels didactic, it's counterpointed by its very real and very human nature.",
            "Quickly dispels oh-no-not-more-doom-and-gloom climate-change trepidation with the optimism embodied in the title. There is hope for us, but we must act now.",
            "A hopeful and helpful look at the positive efforts all around the world to stop the progression of climate change.",
            "A sobering polemic about global warming that balances familiar predictions of planetary doom with a survey of innovations in renewable energy technology that hold out some hope for the future.",
            "This is not a film that leaves you in hand-wringing despair. Rather it is unapologetically on the optimistic side, telling us in no uncertain terms that \"we can stop climate change.\"",
            "\"Over 600 million people's homes will be destroyed if the world's coastlines are flooded.\" Yes, and over 7 billion people will be killed if aliens decide to destroy the human race, but that isn't going to happen either.",
            "Highlight[s] steps we can take today to improve our climate.",
            "Efficient, cogently argued, and visually compelling ...",
            "As Singleton puts it: \"The battle to save the orangutan is not just the battle to save the orangutan. It's the battle for climate change. It's the battle for everything.\"",
            "If 'Time to Choose' is to be seen as 'An Inconvenient Truth 2,' it's at least a next-level sequel, and hopefully even a game-changer for docs that vie for real, needed change amidst the gloom.",
            "Rather than shrugging with disgust, Ferguson points to the better world that nearly everybody wants and that already exists in some places. Then he simply asks that we vote for it.",

            "What separates... Time to Choose from the many other documentaries about climate change is that, after dutifully presenting many of the usual horrifying climate statistics, it lays out a series of possible solutions, already available, to the crisis.",
            "What elevates \"Time to Choose,\" other than its very strong editing by Beck, is the sense that not only are people doing something to change the trajectory of our planet's depleted resources but that you can make a difference too.",
            "A film that shapes and alters your perceptions.",
            "Ferguson portrays the climate struggle as a winnable war, but also a titanic one, pitting a small, greedy plutocracy against the rest of the world's citizens.",

            "A sobering polemic about global warming that balances familiar predictions of planetary doom with a survey of innovations in renewable energy technology that hold out some hope for the future.",
            "This is not a film that leaves you in hand-wringing despair. Rather it is unapologetically on the optimistic side, telling us in no uncertain terms that \"we can stop climate change.\"",
            "\"Over 600 million people's homes will be destroyed if the world's coastlines are flooded.\" Yes, and over 7 billion people will be killed if aliens decide to destroy the human race, but that isn't going to happen either.",

            "The movie has been praised as a genre-bending experiment, though it's more like a bottom-feeding exploitation movie masquerading as an art film. ",
            "Neither tribute nor analysis, this doc offers an inappropriately off-beam treatment for such a serious subject.",
            "It's troubling, ambiguous, at times queasily unsettling, and an experience that is hard to shake off.",
            "This meta-doc is sorely and maddeningly lacking testimonies from those who were close to Chubbuck.",
            "You admire the diligence and thoughtfulness of the director and the actress but you still doubt their motives. ",
            "It's not even a character study. They are after the process of an actress trying to connect with her subject. It's also about the nature of performances and giving another layer of complexities in portraying real life characters.",
            "The [lure] of a gory spectacle is what keeps us slogging through this two-hour circular meditation, ... to showcase Greene's ability to manipulate viewers into self-disgust[.]",
            "Kate Play Christine is as delicate as it is tough, and it's a worthy glimpse into the hearts and minds of those who attempt to capture life from many different angles.",
            "There are moments where the film can feel aimless or messy, but it's difficult to criticize an inherently flawed design.",
            "Along with the possible foreshadowing, there is a palpable sense of foreboding, thanks to the use of a moody synthesizer. Meanwhile, the cinematography is frequently washed out...",
            " It's a fascinating insight into the modern \"method acting\" you hear discussed all the time, but rarely see. What's disappointing is the lack of depth. ",
            "It doesn't sensationalize Chubbuck's death and yet it is sensational.",
            "Everyone ... is questioned for what we choose to see, and why we refuse to let some ghosts rest.",
            "Much like its tortured subject, the film is an enigma of contradictory interpretations that could explode with rage on a moment's notice.",
            "Kate Plays Christine is a story about our tendency to distort stories, and it questions our right to tell them at all.",
            "Blurring the line between narrative and non-fiction, Robert Greene's Kate Plays Christine is a magnetic tale of investigation.",
            "This may all sound intriguing on paper, but in practice it's often dull and strained, and we get the queasy sense that this woman, likable enough, is beating herself up doing something that Kate Plays Christine essentially says is not worth doing. ",
            "Sometimes over-infatuated with its own meta stratagems though it may be, Kate Plays Christine's machinery of wheels is always cranking vigorously.",
            "Since I already knew the basic plot from the previous movie I'd seen about this event ('Christine') this seemed a bit boring, right up until the scene where Kate is supposed to pretend to kill herself on camera. Then, everything changed. Wow!",
            "Robert Greene's film follows the actress Kate Lyn Sheil as she prepares to play Chubbuck in a project that's part documentary, part fiction and a bit too much navel-gazing.",
            "Thought in action, ideas in motion and also the portrayal of a slippery, frightening slide down a rabbit hole of hurt... The story is what is true and what is false, and it's all true and it's all false... Ghosts. Ghosts everywhere. ",
            "By trying to be both a documentary and a biopic, the film fails to be either, and its central dual characters fall flat.",
            "Ultimately raising more questions than it answers, Kate Plays Christine's lack of self-awareness will leave viewers cold."

            "At a time when so many cinematic arguments are cast in black-and-white terms, tipping the scales in one direction, it's refreshing to see one that's content to present a case that leaves room for several shades of gray.",
            "The powerful filmmaking duo of Chris Hegedus and D.A. Pennebaker somehow turn Wise's quest into a compelling and noble tale, no matter what your thoughts are on the views presented.",
            "The picture is essentially a brief for Wise's case. And as such, it's as dry and uncinematic as a dusty legal document.",
            "Makes a worthy case for reconsidering the sturdiness of laws that explicitly separate humans from animals.",
            "It's difficult to make a documentary about a legal battle interesting...But Unlocking The Cage achieves this because at its heart is a fascinating exploration of what it is to be a person, told in an intelligent and utterly convincing way.",
            "Hegedus and Pennebaker present a rational argument with no bias needed, and the results are compelling.",
            "Wise's activism is much more nuanced and deals in gray areas. If the result doesn't immediately smack your conscience, that's because the answer is still evolving. ",
            "As a documentation of these early stages, combined with a charismatic subject on the hunt for what he feels to be a matter of fundamental justice, Unlocking the Cage is sure to be a film that many audiences will find captivating.",
            "We aren't particularly invested in the chimps we barely see, and the court case doesn't have the high-stakes thrill it should have; the film fails to make us care enough about either of them.",
            "Unlocking the Cage, is an uneven journey that might have benefitted from standing back a step and taking a wider view of the issue.",
            "Directors D.A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus are renowned for their direct, unmediated filmmaking, and this doc is no different.",
            "What's most interesting here, on the dramatic front, is the genuine engagement [Wise and company] achieve with judges and state's attorneys encountered along the way.",
            "It's a tricky narrative challenge to shift from inherently compelling wildlife scenes to abstract courtroom debate, but the film manages it capably, even spicing things up with one justice's admonition that Wise needs to cut his slavery analogies.",
            "This journey through the highest courts in New York State makes \"Alice Through the Looking Glass\" look like a trip to the Walmart.",
            "An exemplary piece of documentary storytelling.",
            "A sharply made piece of work that cleanly breaks down [Steven] Wise's arguments into intelligible, bite-sized chunks while also fully articulating those arguments in the full opaque glory of legalese jargon.",
            "What constitutes self-determination and what responsibility humans have toward other sentient beings can't be answered by a single film, but this is nevertheless a valuable contribution to an ongoing and still-shifting conversation. ",
            "The film is at its best when it allows us to eavesdrop in the courtroom. When Wise argues in front of the New York Supreme Court, the judges ask tough, probing questions, and both the questions and answers are given their proper shrift.",
            "Heartbreaking and heartening in equal measure, \"Unlocking the Cage\" is a profound examination of animal rights issues and a stirring portrait of a heroic activist.",
            "The doc makes a strong case albeit without many animations and other effects that intelligent animals like chimps should be classified as legal persons.",
            "Even allowing for the anthropomorphic misreadings that humans often apply to animals, it's clear that many of the nonhumans in this film deserve a better life. Unlocking the Cage provides some legal ballast for that sentiment.",
            "The film is impeccably shot and paced, but the radical real-world implications of Wise's agenda are never fully explored."

            "Beautifully shot by John Pope, the story is sometimes caught in an endless loop of despair, but Mokhnenko's tough-love optimism for the orphans, and for a country caught up in war and rebellion, shines through.",

            "Steve Hoover's documentary Almost Holy is a chilling look at just how not-good things got (and remained) in Ukraine after the Soviet Union collapsed.",
            "In its quieter moments, Almost Holy allows us to wonder whether the end really does justify the means.",
            "This documentary isn't about heroes and villains, or determining right and wrong. It's about hope in the face of hopelessness, and what drives a man to keep trying to change the seemingly unchangeable.",
            "Vital viewing.",
            "A Ukrainian priest proves himself a hero among heroes, literally saving children, and his story is richly compelling and totally inspiring.",
            "Steve Hoover took considerable risks in making a film about a pastor who takes his Christianity seriously. If we had more directors and pastors like these two, the world would be in a lot better shape."

            "Most anthology films have ups and downs. It's almost inevitable. Southbound is more even and has more connective tissue than most, but it does feature one segment that singlehandedly justifies seeing the whole movie.",

            "It has an amazing sense of homage without ever really trying to reference The Twilight Zone, and, at the same time, it's an entity all of its own.",
            " Still, Southbound does deliver when raising signals of suspicion, atmospheric chills, head-scratching symbolism and a startling presence of isolation in the form of a stretched out highway presumably heading to the halls of hell.",
            "Feels like an incomplete exercise in Twilight Zone pastiche. If you're down for 90 minutes of blood soaked comeuppance, satanic cults and alternate realties, then the film might be of interest. Otherwise, non-genre aficionados beware.",
            "A powerful variation on the multi-story film. SOUTHBOUND is five horrific stories, each of which fades into the next.",
            "The horror anthology Southbound is a hit-or-miss affair, a bunch of half-formed ideas that never coalesce into a satisfying shocker.",

            "There's something beautifully sandy and gritty about the majority of Southland's stories. America's highways are a never ending dustbowl of horror, interspersed with sad motels and grim gas stations and the atmosphere is enjoyably unsettling. ",
            "Like practically every horror anthology in existence it doesn't totally hit the mark, but Southbound on the whole is a demented, weird and occasionally hilarious selection of genre shorts.",
            "The much hyped anthology horror... ties five stories together as strangers running from their guilt collide on a stretch of desert highway that isn't all it appears to be. The linking is done brilliantly, especially between our two favourite segments.",
            "There's 120 minutes of this lazy, unmotivated stuff.",
            "To the littlest detail, it's derivative - and, worse, not scary.",

            "This clever updating of Mark Twain finds Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer involved in a comic caper.",
            "In addition to Twain, the directors clearly worship the Coens, specifically \"Raising Arizona.\" And that's OK.",
            "I think it's a bad idea that's badly done in at least two ways, maybe three, but however many there are they're all fatal.",
            "The filmmakers have described \"Band of Robbers\" as fan fiction, and that feels about right: They don't quite hit the mark, but it's fun to watch them trying.",
            "Although often clumsy and out of sync, the brand of comedic twists on Twain's famous literary figures and setting make Band of Robbers an adequate tale of fan fiction.",
            "One minute it's a breezy comedy sailing along with laughter, and then before you know it you're fearing for the lives of characters without an effective tonal shift",
            "Forget the plot, forget the moral lessons, the acting is reason enough to see Band of Robbers.",
            "Don't be surprised to hear more from the Nee brothers in the future, especially if Adam Nee continues his fine work in front of the camera as well. They clearly are a talented duo.",
            "Capturing the heart of the novel and injecting a quirky, introspective sensibility, here is an example of filmmaking at its most inspired.",
            "The quirky premise generates some amusing moments, yet the uneven script can't sustain its early momentum.",
            "Band of Robbers fares slightly better as a cutesy combination of two American treasures: Mark Twain and Wes Anderson.",
            "Band of Robbers is full of deep references to the books, but also stands on its own as a fresh and occasionally touching take on the \"overambitious young schmucks decide to do some crimes and get in over their heads.\"",

            "This comic take on \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" and \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\" is infused with a gleefully absurdist sense of humor while retaining a childlike sense of wonder.",
            "A nice little cache of comedy gold. ",
            "The premise is clever and the Nees clearly have great affection for Twain's work, but a cool idea isn't enough to sustain it past the opening chapters.",
            "This comedic caper resembles Wes Anderson's jaunty Bottle Rocket in plot, style, and a dusty-bright visual aesthetic, but it's infused with Twain's acerbic humor.",
            "This sprightly and very funny caper film-which is also an affecting meditation on friendship and the pain of growing up-is surprisingly engaging.",
            "In its goofier opening half, Band Of Robbers spends so much time giving every story-point a Sawyer/Finn context that the gimmick eventually becomes stifling.",
            "The directors of Band of Robbers, brothers Aaron and Adam Nee, have set out to modernize the stories of Mark Twain but end up with a cutesy caper that isn't as memorable as you might hope.",
            "It places more focus on the childish fabulousness of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer than the racial reckoning of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."

            "Bob Cenedella brings all the drama necessary to make Art Bastard a compelling portrait. ",
            "Sure, the artist is a bit full of himself, but I've found that people who aren't full of themselves tend to be full of platitudes and other people's anecdotes. I'll take a windbag over a grab bag any day.",

            "There are strains of Gogol and Kafka in this intriguing if flawed movie from Russian director Ivan I Tverdovskiy, shot in a restless handheld style, the camera roaming and panning across a dreary workaday world.",

            "An intriguing premise becomes a meandering, unclear contemplation - with a fitting visual motif of walking - yet never receives much payoff.",
            "Even when the film deals with the fetishization of the other, it's another way in which it's seriously engaging in social commentary.",
            "The film's magical realism is a dark satire of Russian contemporary life, sexuality, morality, health service and society, with an outstanding performance from Natalia Pavlenkova.",
            "Marbled with melancholy, this is an intelligent meditation on gender, age and body image.",
            "[Pavlenkova's] acting is Zoology's sole redeeming point, which makes it all the more distasteful that all the plot developments, and the tentative love story in particular, are put in the service of the final twist.",
            "Tverdovsky doesn't take the story anywhere really startling. His compassionate, intriguing film is enjoyable but anticlimactic.",
            "Any redemption in Zoology comes from the sheer accomplishment of Natalya Pavlenkova's playing. To explore such depths of pain is, perverse though it may seem, somehow to transcend them.",
            "Ivan I. Tverdovskiy gives the world a poetically tragic story of a reclusive outsider. It's painful, it's grim, and it's sometimes hard to watch, but patient viewers will be rewarded by this unclassifiable oddity.",
            "Pavlenkova mesmerises as the unorthodox creature of the night, but the story is just a little too scatter-brained to become a true body-horror classic.",
            "Pavlenkova's rich, emotional performance is one of the reasons it becomes such an involving, touching film but Tverdovsky's sure touch, bone-dry social satire and affinity with the outsider confirms him as a talent to watch.",
            "It feels like a lot more could have been done with an idea and setting which lends itself to so much, and yet gives less than it promises.",
            "The picture ... addresses a question not often examined in movies, and an eternal source of debate among those who are noticeably different: Is it dehumanizing when someone is specifically attracted to the elements that set you apart? ",
            "Natalya Pavlenkova gives a wonderful performance, but the movie around her merely coasts along on its surface weirdness.",
            "Zoology is a thoughtful parable about embracing one's difference instead of turning tail.",

            "If you like to shop at farmer's markets, this film will show you some of the effort it takes to grow the food you eat, and it is not a pretty sight at times. It also makes a pretty good argument for being a vegetarian.",

            "However you take Peter Dunning, though, there is something admirable to the way Tony Stone and co. view their subject with a fascination that's filled with clear-eyed empathy. It's the kind of unsentimental compassion that animates the best art.",

            "Whatever your conception of a farmer may be, Peter Dunning, the 68-year-old subject of Peter And The Farm, may deviate from it significantly.",
            "More like Charles Bukowski than Henry David Thoreau, the eponymous farmer featured in this brilliant film is a reminder that documentaries are often far better than narrative films in character development."

            "As with other mumblecore projects, the plot is secondary to mood, naturalism, and the relationship between the two protagonists, but in this historical context that approach is more of a frustration than a virtue. ",
            "\"Men Go to Battle\" isn't always effective, in that way DIY filmmaking sometimes irritates by deliberately avoiding \"moments.\" But as an offbeat lens through which to view an oft-mined era, it has a quiet pull.",
            "The result is an odd but invigorating movie, and an intoxicatingly gutsy and personal take on historical fiction.",
            "The acting here, like too much of the film, ends up registering as unfortunately amateurish.",
            "Hard not to admire its existence. Equally hard not to wish it was more daring.",
            "Striking in its evocation of a demanding time and place, this intimate drama about individual and national transformation heralds the arrival of an arresting new filmmaking voice ...",
            "This deadpan dramedy plays now as what it was destined to become - a one-off stab at doing something different by a director/co-writer trying and failing to make his big break. ",
            "[It] looks and feels very real. There is not a moment in this film that breaks the illusion of the material reality of its period (the middle of the 19th century) and location (Kentucky).",
            "Light on plot and heavy on reflective imagery, the film operates as a restrained comedy, complete with the rhythms of a certain brand of American indie cinema, but not beholden to its tropes or clich\u00e9s.",
            "The hyperlocal Men Go to Battle-a microbudget affair to which critics have justly applied the adjective \"resourceful\" ever since its premiere at Tribeca last spring-also has subtler ways of imbuing the historical past with a sense of immediacy.",
            "America was very different 150 years ago than it is now, and the filmmakers capture that well. They just do not do it under the microscope of the Civil War anywhere near as thoroughly as they had the opportunity or the foundation to.",
            "Deep down it's not about authenticity so much as how time stomps on us all, and how major historical events occur outside of our perception.",
            "Though the film never deeply transcends its basic thesis about the ramshackle lives of frustrated men, the final minutes are improbably touching for how the story eschews uplift in favor of a more honest conclusion.",
            "With the exception of Ms. Korine, the performers often seem to have a hard time shaking off the aura of the contemporary. Nevertheless, there's much of value here.",
            "It might seem apolitical at first glance, but Men Go To Battle's ramshackle vibe has its subversive qualities.",
            "It's too texturally exacting in its recreation of a transitory moment in U.S. history to register as a failure.",
            "This isn't a film about the Civil War; it's about the minds of white folks so removed from plantation life that they feel they have no stake in it at all. It's not about back then - it's about being.",

            "Men Go to Battle... possess an admirable homespun appeal that is punctuated by an outstanding attention to detail&#8202;.",
            "It isn't easy to stage a Civil War story on a budget that probably couldn't pay for a day's lunch on the set of Glory (even before you adjust for inflation), but Zachary Treitz's Men Go to Battle is a triumph of resourcefulness.",
            "Minimalist in terms of action and scope but attentive to the texture of what is onscreen.",
            "Admirable more for its effort than its execution, this ambitious period piece shows that it's possible to re-create the Civil War on a shoestring budget as long as you're more focused on capturing mood than historical nitpicking.",
            "It's an intriguing yet dissatisfying curiosity.",
            "Mumblecore and the period drama have (somehow) come together, and the result is far better than people who are generally allergic to the subgenre may expect. "

            "The dialogue is minimalistic, and most of it courtesy of Lucinda's cruel taunts that cut like a knife. But even those moments are never fully explored.",
            "Too much goes unsaid and too many issues are unresolved. The scenery is nice, but \"Five Nights in Maine\" just isn't worth the trip.",
            "Curran guides the cast to commendable performances across the board, with Oyelowo and Wiest delivering controlled, nuanced work to fill in the script's generous negative space.",
            "The dreary postmortem drama \"Five Nights in Maine\" is barely kept afloat by the gravitas of dueling leads David Oyelowo and Dianne Wiest.",
            "A believable character study that may not draw crowds but certainly challenges its two lead actors.",
            "In creating such an elegant, poignant portrait of what it's like to mourn, she shows there's hope in being able to recognize beauty as it exists in the world, sometimes in the most unexpected places.",
            "Ultimately, Five Nights in Maine is a film that's centered on a heavy and sad subject matter that ends up feeling empty.",
            "While inherently fascinating in its analysis of grief ... it has difficulty finding its hook.",
            "Curran's deliberate pace captures the quietness of the setting of Five Nights in Maine, but the thinness of her script is what makes the film feel sluggish.",
            "Maris Curran's Five Nights in Maine has very little new to offer.",
            "With its intimate setting and deliberate pace, the film feels like an acting workshop that might have worked better on stage.",
            "Quiet drama has strong acting but needs more story.",
            "We're left to guess how they feel at the beginning of the film and we don't learn much more by the end.",
            "Curran's script gives the actors too little substance with which to work their magic. The filmmaker's minimalist style is too sparse for the material.",
            "It's a small movie, often to a fault. But every time you're about to write it off as \"Generic Grief Indie #451,\" it surprises you.",
            "Her two exceptional stars do their best to convey their animosity via simmering glances. But in the end, Curran's muted approach does them no favors.",
            "Just watching these two spar in \"Maine\" would be enough to satisfy, but Curran has prepared something special, transforming a simple tale of reconnection into a labyrinth of surging, confusing emotions.",
            "The effect is a series of vignettes that fail to hold attention even though the movie clocks in at a merciful 83 minutes.",
            "The film's reluctance to sully its hands in schmaltzy Nicolas Sparks-esque digressions leaves us with a threadbare and anticlimactic narrative.",
            "Inscrutable and not especially compelling.",
            "Curran's film is at once admirable in its avoidance of easy sentiment and kind of predictable once its quiet seriousness makes itself known (which is to say very early on).",
            "Maris Curran never reconciles the film's impulse to interiority with its weakness for hothouse melodrama. ",
            "A fine cast gives us two nights worth of movie, but without nearly as much to chew on as the stingy-with-story director would have you believe. "

            "Ozu's characters don't seek ecstasy, not because they are afraid of it but because they are brave enough to accept compromise.",
            "Yasujiro Ozu's 1949 film inaugurated his majestic late period: it's here that he decisively renounces melodrama (and, indeed, most surface action of any kind) and lets his camera settle into the still, long-take contemplation.",
            "A story that is so heartbreaking and yet so perfect in every decision made and every word spoken. ",

            "Sadness is tempered with humor, even to a 'good luck' wallet found under a policeman's nose, just as, tempered by the unknown and unforeseeable, life itself is sweet as well as bitter.",
            "Ozu's low camera position helps the audience relate to his characters, and his almost-always static shots portray the sturdy demeanor of his characters.",
            "Ozu trains his trademarked fixed camera on the deceptively simple story of a father and daughter and finds in it nothing short of the whole wide world.",
            "impermanence... forms the film's true subject - and it is Ozu's ambivalence towards it, as though he wants both to board the train, and to stay on the platform, that ultimately gives Late Spring its bittersweet resonance.",
            "Haiku-like in its title, its interest in the undramatic silences between scenes, and its enfolding of human behaviour within nature, Late Spring offers tenderness in the place of melodrama and patient truth in the place of sudden revelation.",
            "An early indicator of Ozu's late-career greatness, his remarkably subtle family drama Late Spring finds him at his expressive peak.",
            "Late Spring is, along with Tokyo Story, Ozu's greatest work.",
            "One of the director's favorites.",
            "Ozu's camera is observational, rather than intrusive; even when we get something akin to a close-up, it never feels like it's invading the character's space.",
            "the work of a master",
            "Exquisite ... What little plot there is in Late Spring is adorned by Ozu's Zen-like meditation on objects, surroundings and the Japanese concept of mono no aware -- the ineffable resignation to the reality of life as things are.",
            "welcome respite from mindless, dispassionate cinema",
            "Late Spring exemplifies Ozu's rich, mature style, an apparent stylelessness of patient, lifelike rhythms, unobtrusive camerawork, and credibly subtle performances. [DVD]",
            "With no one looking but the camera, Hara's face registers anger, jealousy and humiliation, all in the space of a few seconds."

            "Some viewers, mindful of Fellini's reputation, will be impatient with the film. Its restlessness and turbulence will unnerve them. But there is genius at work here.",
            "In a flash Fellini establishes a humorous dream state that is then sustained with remarkable zest and ingenuity for the duration of the ride.",
            "Federico Fellini covers his bets in this hallucinatory survey of the women's movement -- it isn't reactionary enough to offend or progressive enough to matter.",
            "What baffled me was, not why Fellini didn't see that the film wasn't very good but that he didn't recognize its familiarity, didn't know how much he was repeating himself.",
            "Only a pinchpenny soul could denigrate the generosity, the sheer fertility of the Maestro's invention in this curate's egg by Faberg\u00e9.",
            "It is no longer enough that Fellini deal with the ways women tantalize, dominate, and possess his male heroes. Now he must also deal with the women themselves. For Fellini, this is probably not nearly so much fun.",
            "Arguably, this isn't a bad film by any means, but perhaps a familiar scenario a bit too broad, a bit too demeaning, and a bit too monotonous to register as one of the esteemed auteur's more notable achievements.",
            "Whether or not it all works is moot -- Fellini is no longer making the statements about life he once made in films like La Strada, but he is still Fellini and he still holds our attention.",
            "Stylists are only interesting when they consciously choose to forego substance. Fellini can't make that choice. And, when he tries to be serious, he succeeds only in becoming meretricious.",
            "What if women took over the world? That's the premise of this hypnotically alluring Federico Fellini film.",
            "Masochistic, misogynistic, City of Women is a flamboyant, sophisticated series of set pieces, a boastful apologia pro vita sua.",
            "Plotless but undoubtedly Fellini. Federico Fellini's psychedelic exploration of feminine mysteries is another visual tour de force in an elaborate dream framework, with a ponderous tone.",
            "Wonderfully uninhibited.",
            "Tedious.",
            "Interesting, but one of Fellini's weakest films.",

            "You're hearing some good stories told from the viewpoints of minor characters. This will hold your attention best if you are a \"Star Wars\" completist or a super-fan.",
            "The most interesting part of Elstree 1976 comes when these actors express ambivalence about their odd celebrity.",
            "In telling a small story of bit players, the director, Jon Spira, captures a more universal picture of the droplets of fame created by a pop-culture tidal wave.",
            "A sweet, quietly funny, fascinating and contemplative study of 10 character actors and extras, none of whom had any idea back in the 1970s they'd forever be defined by the one or two days they spent on the set of a sci-fi movie.",
            "Like a storm troopers' aim, the documentary only occasionally hits the mark, but it's nevertheless a fascinating look at how 15 minutes of fame ages over 40 years.",
            "For hundreds of actors, bit-part players and costume-dwellers appearing in Star Wars in 1977 was the moment that would shape their lives-they were granted immortality.",
            "A crowdfunded effort from director Jon Spira, Elstree 1976 is largely a matter of talking heads, some of whom are more interesting than others. ",
            "[Director Jon] Spira has genuinely found something new to say about Star Wars, producing something with value and insight to appeal beyond just the fan faithful.",
            "Spira's take is undeniably affectionate, but offers little insight into the trilogy for Star Wars fans. Yet Elstree 1976 is so inextricably linked to George Lucas' space opera, it's difficult to imagine what the appeal could be ...",
            "Amid some amusing tidbits, most of the anecdotes aren't very compelling or insightful, and there's not much else.",
            "How many movies would inspire a documentary about its bit players, almost 40 years after its initial release? Very few, but \"Star Wars\" is certainly one of them.",
            "Elstree 1976 is a must-see for Star Wars fanatics, and coming shortly after the much-hyped franchise adrenaline shot that is The Force Awakens, it's almost shocking to hear firsthand accounts of the first film's way-under-the-radar status.",
            "Elstree 1976 serves as a relevant Star Wars companion for fans big and small.",
            "It wears out its welcome after about an hour. It also raises a few questions that are left unanswered. But there's still enough here to make it worth a look for fans.",
            "The movie's major take-away? Dave Prowse deserves his own documentary.",
            "Given what a multibillion-dollar behemoth the Star Wars universe has become, it's fascinating to discover that a long time ago in a studio sound stage far, far away, no one took it very seriously at all.",
            "\"Elstree 1976\" is an amazing experience. I'm shocked that a documentary revisiting the making of \"Star Wars\" could be this boring.",
            "It all adds to the idea that Star Wars was both the best and the worst thing to happen to its low-level supporting cast.",
            "A genial study of fleeting fame and its aftermath.",
            "While the quirky outcome falls short of that ambition, it offers a slice of enjoyable nostalgia, capturing a sense of life as silly, surprising, regretful and all too fleeting.",
            "It finds a way of proving valuable not just to fans, but to Force agnostics as well.",
            "Elstree 1976 mostly succeeds in its attempt to shed light on the people behind the makeup and masks. Here there is humility and jealousy, gratitude and bemusement, eloquently and touchingly recounted."

            "I found the film most successful when it left its tenant farm setting for a lovely, lyrical boat trip to the big city, the one moment of expansiveness in Olmi's otherwise hermetic narration. ",
            "The film has a tempo as slow as the seasons' turn, but there is something magnificent in its utter commitment and authenticity.",
            "Produces feelings of aching joy and melancholy in equal measure.",
            "What I'm suggesting is that this movie should be viewed for its actual visual content, rather than for its noble pretensions.",
            "A gentle Catholic counterpoint to angry Marxist peasant cinema&#133; acutely aware of harsh economic and social injustices, but devoid of violent revolutionary spirit.",
            "A hypnotic look at a way of life that no longer exists. ",
            "The asceticism of the film accentuates the slowness of a story that is already too prolonged. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "The harmonious unity of Ermanno Olmi's film, despite one or two discordant notes, stems largely from the director's circumspect approach to all its elements. The parts are justly proportioned and nothing is allowed to command undue attention.",
            "Using a non-professional cast it demands patience, but stick with it and its warm, gentle humanism, plus Olmi's affection for his characters, soon become beguiling.",
            "You don't need to have experienced the film's world firsthand to grasp the transparency with which Olmi depicts it, full as it is with simple pleasures, complex emotions, and unadorned heartbreak.",
            "It's easy enough to appreciate...as a painterly near-documentary, shot and edited by a director who got his start in documentary films...or a spacious moral fable about humility and trust in following the righteous path. [Criterion Blu-ray]",
            "Keeps its Marxist message under wraps, and manages never to be either lackluster or thrilling.",
            "An Italian masterpiece that elegantly and effortlessly depicts the natural rhythms of life in a rural community in the nineteenth century. ",
            "The value here is in documenting an example of the small social units and their values that were steps in the evolution to representational government.",
            "Fewer movies have been done with greater sensitivity or integrity than The Tree of Wooden Clogs. Surely no three-hour movie has ever seemed so short and I I've seen some half-this length that have seemed to run twice as long."

            "The chaotic audio and video footage of these altercations generates enormous drama even as it eclipses the issues at hand; though undeniably heroic, the documentary dwells less on its subject than on its own production.",

            "This raw and startling doc isn't about young rape victims in China and the institutions that enable the culprits. Instead, it's about the methods used to silence the activists who draw attention to those problems.",
            "Budding filmmakers can take away a valuable lesson from the documentary \"Hooligan Sparrow\": You don't need fancy camera equipment (or in some instances, even a camera) if you're passionate enough about the story you want to tell.",
            "Hooligan Sparrow must been seen by the widest audience possible.",
            "Wang has bravely crafted an indispensible documentation of how the Chinese government uses threats and intimidation to squash dissension...",
            "To see Wang simply operating the camera is gratifying; a gesture that asserts critical presence in the face of state-orchestrated odds.",
            "Documenting what Ye Haiyan and other protesters are going through in China might not change anything. On the other hand, it might move the cause forward a little bit. Here's to a courageous filmmaker, and some courageous protesters.",
            "It's a scrappy film, one made with significant use of hidden cameras, without title cards (...) and told through Wang's narration that echoes with na\u00efve wonder as she discovers the enormity of her story as she records it.",
            "The shards of surveillance of secret police, of intimidation by plainclothes operatives and the sheer oppressive weight meant to crush resistance are equally horrifying, and captured with kaleidoscopic perseverance. ",
            "Like a heart-pounding thriller set in a paranoid conspiracy, [the activist] inspires [the director] to be even more determined to get her story out to the world.",
            "Although it's structurally uneven, the film shines a thought-provoking spotlight on a courageous woman and offers a worthwhile salute to grassroots activism in the face of oppression.",
            "A whistleblowing documentary made with fearless guerrilla cunning ...",
            "It's miraculous that the film exists at all.",
            "\"Hooligan Sparrow,\" which Ms. Wang also shot and skillfully edited, has the pulse of a mainstream thriller but without the pacifying polish and tidiness.",
            "Other movies have more powerfully exposed the corruption of contemporary China, but few have so articulately confronted how women always seem to be the first citizens to have their wings clipped.",
            "Rather than allowing Hooligan Sparrow to represent [subject Ye Haiyan's] achievement, [director Nanfu] Wang continually highlights her own plight.",
            "[A] tremendous documentary ...",
            "Powerful, poignant and illuminating. It will keep you at the edge of your seat.",

            "Although Hooligan Sparrow is a protest film at heart, it is also a fascinating strategy and survival document. ",
            "This is independent filmmaking at its most courageous. By keeping faith with her subjects, she put herself at risk, which is beyond admirable. "

            "The Dying of the Light isn't so much a massacred film as a dismembered one. What's missing in the theatrical cut, like the missing piece of Lake's ear, is something that might pass unnoticed by many but which nevertheless leaves a hole.",
            "\"Dying of the Light\" is a shrill and bombastic slog, with an all-over-the-map collection of tones that never cohere into a credible or compelling vision.",
            "The rushed and often inchoate execution means there's little in the film that gets the benefit of more than a moment's reflection."

            "With little to grab onto-and despite all that it offers-Railroad Tigers is far slower than a goofy action movie that mostly takes place on a locomotive should ever be.",
            "Beyond Mr. Chan's deft work here, \"Railroad Tigers,\" directed by Ding Sheng, is kind of a mess.",
            "Instead of a grand lark of fast fists and derring-do, we get a lumbering, choppy voyage of minimal excitement.",
            "It's only the first week of January, but it will be hard to beat Hong Kong director Ding Sheng's \"Railroad Tigers\" for the best opening credit sequence of the year.",
            "It takes a special anti-talent to make a movie that's hard to follow out of material this broad.",
            "In the end, I can't sit here and say this is one is a must see new piece of his filmography but it might be cool to watch if comes on one day on cable or something.",
            "These \"Tigers\" claw their way into a frivolous lather but whether or not Chan's latest spectacle deserves a boarding pass to enjoy the same blueprint thrills . . . well, hey . . . would you rather see the sequel \"Skiptrace 2\"? I rest my case . . .",
            "This is a film that shovels a lot of coal and blows a lot more smoke but that doesn't mean it's comfy or worthwhile trip.",
            "To be honest, I never really enjoyed movies with Jackie Chan, but this really won me over.",
            "At times it's a blast but the rest of it is sustained largely by the power of Chan's charm and the grace of the clown prince of kung-fu comedy.",
            "This is a movie that does not want you to think too much, lest you notice all its faults. It is a silly caper with the emphasis on action choreography and big set pieces -- which would be fine if the choreography and CGI were not so lacklustre.",
            "The train heist scenes are carefully choreographed, no doubt to give Chan more leeway and CG boost, and the abundant use of explosives takes time away from real break-a-leg stunts.",
            "Ding has taken one of the darkest chapter's in China's history and created an adventure story that will entertain viewers of all ages.",
            "Chan is economical instead of eruptive, gracefully setting up gags and often sidestepping the frenetic movements of his co-stars (who include his son Jaycee). ",
            "While it's nice to see Jackie Chan return to his familiar role as the scrappy underdog hero, this incoherent action comedy doesn't provide much else besides nostalgic appeal for his fans.",
            "Railroad Tigers is overflowing with absurd comedy. Slapstick and physical comedy take precedence over character development and a coherent story. Railroad Tigers is Jackie Chan's Monument's Men.",
            "The movie is fatally glib in tone.",
            "Railroad Tigers is an old-school, moderately campy adventure movie, something American directors were focused on making in the '90s (think 1995's Jumanji) but audiences have mostly relegated today to the realm of nostalgia.",
            "[Jackie] Chan's familiar blend of action comedy is undercut by a persistent line in wince-inducing pro-China rhetoric.",
            "Railroad Tigers is a treat.",
            "Uneven Jackie Chan action flick has war violence. ",
            "Overall a slapdash and silly movie, Railroad Tigers is still a treat to watch, even when it slips into violence and propaganda.",
            "Railroad Tigers is an action epic that wants to be a comedic goofball, as it fumbles both aspects when trying to meld them together."

            "It may be Hollywood melodrama but it's top of the range, giving Clooney and Roberts every opportunity to demonstrate the value of star power. And it's refreshing to have a studio picture about anti-heroes rather than super-heroes.",
            "Money Monster works better as comedy than thriller - but that's not all it wants to be.",
            "Entertaining but not as intelligent as its conceit would promise, Money Monster is a glossy melodrama good enough to pass the time but ultimately disappointing considering the talent behind the camera.",
            "Fervently cynical film in which bad people can do good things and good people can do bad things and the truth ends up being something we simply have to demand.",

            "Money Monster's skewering of our media-obsessed society will certainly make you think, and it's always fun to watch George Clooney and Julia Roberts banter on the big screen, but overall the film's predictability is a letdown.",
            "As it wears on, it veers too far into allegory and away from the credible, but it's still a worthy and surprising ride, and at a taut 98 minutes, it never outstays its welcome.",

            "Again, feel free to grab another baklava, but the aftertaste of this wedding calls for an immediate annulment from this bouncy, bickering bunch.",
            "There are a couple of genuine chuckles here and there, but what the film ultimately lacks are the endearing qualities and surprisingly funny and heartwarming moments that made the first one such a hit. ",
            "As a comedy, the film is great. None of the jokes will have you rolling in the aisles, but they are funny and easy to digest.",
            "MBFGW2 is like going to a Greek restaurant and ordering a sleeve of unsalted saltines.",
            "I feel pretty certain that, objectively, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 was a very bad movie.",
            "The film has all the charisma of a close relative whose quirks would otherwise been gross and grating had you not lived with him for the past few years.",
            "Virtually every character is back. And the familiar cast appears to be having a wonderful time. The critics who are finding fault with My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 aren't exactly wrong. But, I think they're missing the point.",
            "As an ensemble comedy, it somewhat works. But the jokes could have been more in number. Pass the spanakopita, please.",
            "It's almost ironic that Vardalos' first film dealt with establishing her identity within her family unit, as this film can't find its identity - or provide a hilarious plot.",
            "Fans of the original -- myself included -- are going to be so disappointed because My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 is just awful."

            "Leap! follows a pretty simple formula, but the animation during the ballet scenes is lively and well-done. It's spirited enough to keep the film from feeling too familiar.",
            "The anachronistic pop songs actually work quite nicely with the scenes of classical dancing, and will most likely help hold the attention of the little ones.",
            "The French animated adventure Leap! is at turns stupendous and insufferable, the film never showing enough faith in its audience in order for the lovely little scenario of resilience and fortitude at the heart of things to ever resonate . . .",
            "Though the mix of poppy power anthems and Tchaikovsky isn't seamless and the familiar plot points are less than transporting, there's a beating heart to this tween story to match its exuberant dance sequences.",

            "Beneath the vulgar facade and low-budg sheen lies a very self-safe origin story skeleton, one that lives and breathes by the beats of that whence came before it.",
            "Deadpool has the potential to make previous Marvel superhero movies seem lumbering and ponderously humorless in comparison.",
            "Reynolds makes it work. Sneering superheroes are a new breed, but Reynolds' inherent charm and first-time director Tim Miller's light touch keep the ultra-gory film from veering into gratuitously snarky territory.",
            "The film is, thankfully, hilarious from titles to post-credits, with thick and fast references to worlds real and mutant, and a levity to counterpoint the darkness."

            "Toho's reboot of its most famous kaiju is, amidst intense monster action, a bitter satire on bureaucracy and a cautionary tale about humanity's collective folly."

            "Excepting Perry's performance as Brian, the film is chockablock with terrible actors, and the jokes he gives his inferior cast to work with are stinkers.",
            "Madea remains a distinctive, weirdly compelling character. Maybe someday Perry will make a good comedy for her.",
            "Mr. Perry is ... an eccentric, inspired performer, and his screen-filling antics as the raucous but righteous Madea - a character who runs through Mr. Perry's stage, film and TV work - is the truly pertinent component here.",
            "This comedy is unlikely to win over any new fans, but the devoted will find comfort in the familiarity.",
            "At 103 minutes, this film has way too much dead weight. Scenes are repeated over and over, and some of the acting would not cut it in a school play.",
            "\"A Madea Halloween\" is rare for Perry in that it's one of only two \"Madea\" films not adapted from a stage play, but it sure feels like one, with several scenes ... feeling like a one-act, one-room play that goes on and on and on.",
            "Boo! A Madea Halloween is a movie that shouldn't exist.",
            "The film spirals into supposedly funny, but actually vindictive, violent fantasy. ",
            "Like the trick-or-treating scene, Perry the director doesn't know when to exit.",
            "Boo! feels like a one-note television sketch that runs on and on and never really goes anywhere. This isn't perceptive nor inspired comedy; it's lazy, self-referential, and tired.",
            "It seems with this film that [Perry] is possibly going a different direction with the Madea franchise and I don't like it.",
            " Indeed, Boo! A Madea Halloween screams of being a cruel trick for the mis-TREAT-ment of Perry enthusiasts eagerly willing to embrace this piece of throwaway holiday hokum.",
            "Just another cheap Tyler Perry sitcom film. ",
            "On paper, everything Tyler Perry does is not only smart, but it's also important. At it's best, you have films like 'Madea's Family Reunion', at it's worst, you have this film.",
            "A heavily moralizing comedy that wants to be a horror comedy, but is barely a horror film and only sometimes a comedy.",
            "Though this isn't a well-crafted movie by any means, when it works, and it does so intermittently, it's legitimately funny.",
            "The best of all the Madea films.",
            "No matter how many films Perry writes, directs, produces, and stars in, he's not especially interested in getting better at it.",
            "Instead of running full force with the conceit, Perry's own directorial limitations hinder the finished product.",
            "Isn't a bad movie by any stretch, but it is Tyler Perry's most unfocused and tonally inconsistent.",
            "By removing most of the \"Go with God\" material, the faith-based filmmaker has created his most consistent mainstream comedy to date. ",
            "The fans will probably be pleased, but the most interesting thing about this one is how Perry finesses playing scenes with himself in three different roles.",
            "Boo! is certainly the most watchable Madea movie I've seen in a long time, even though I get the feeling Perry still doesn't know how to direct for the screen.",
            "Dropping Madea into a comic Halloween adventure should have been a recipe for fun. Dropping her into one that recycles jokes and celebrates the virtues of beating children proves to be the exact opposite of fun."

            "Miracles from Heaven is manipulative, blunt, super-Christian propaganda that's dignified and deeply moving in its own way.",
            "To have it suddenly blatantly preach to the converted and to the converted alone is a missed opportunity of massive proportions, making watching Miracles from Heaven at all a serious waste of time.",
            "Miracles From Heaven aims for faith-based audiences, and its narrow focus keeps the film's message of possibility and positivity from wider viewers.",
            "What a strange film.",
            "No heathen is going to be persuaded by a film that holds back its revelations until all but the already-convinced have left. ",
            "By and large, the film is drippy kitsch, alternating between sub-Terrence Malick&#8203; images of everyday \"miracles\" and forced, feeble attempts at comic relief.",
            "The kind of film that will affirm the faith of believers yet even non-churchgoers will find much to love here.",
            "Powerful, emotionally satisfying and uplifting, you'll leave the theatre with a smile on your heart and a belief in Miracles From Heaven.",
            "The thing that impressed me about this film was how subtle it was compared to other faith-based films.",
            "We care for the girl's suffering, the mother's struggle, and hope all the medical science available to the doctor is enough, even though we know a miracle from heaven is directly around the corner",
            "Miracles from Heaven will satisfy its intended audience and do absolutely nothing for anyone else.",
            "Though the title guarantees uplift, this gruelling drama spends an hour dragging you into a well of depression.",
            "While I'm happy that Anna and her family are doing well, it's too bad that the movie that's based on their lives seems less than miraculous.",
            "Believers and fans of uplifting, unashamedly emotional stories will enjoy this. Non-believers will struggle with the message and tone.",
            "Engaging performances certainly broaden its appeal, especially from the younger members of the cast. But as you might guess from the title, it's totally preaching to the converted.",
            "Though unquestionably a film of faith, Miracles from Heaven doesn't ram its religiosity down your throat quite as much as many others of its kind do. Not until a horribly over-fluffy finale, that is.",
            "Those of a wobbly disposition may find themselves momentarily lifted up, but they should be prepared to come back to earth with a bump.",
            "A profound story with round characters turn this film into a powerful drama. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "There is no dramatic tension to this film - the entire premise is already summarised in the title.",
            "It's far from the worst of its genre.",
            "A cheap soap opera episode that tries to be manipulate as it can be. [Full review in Spanish]",

            "The religious thrust - that life is tough to get through and being a Christian makes it a bit easier - is weak, and the film is disturbingly anti-scientific at its core."

            "A funny, charming, satirical, feminist tale that shows both director Feng Xiaogang and actress Fan Bingbing at their best. How this film was NOT considered as a submission for the Foreign Language Film Oscar is baffling beyond belief.",
