            "The insubstantiality of the film isn't due to the infinite yet flimsy malleability of C.G.I. gimmickry but, instead, to the dispersion of its drama throughout the many cinematic installations set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",
            "This chaotic but surprisingly nimble instalment, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, brings together an eye-popping ensemble cast of A-listers (imagine the table read!) and pushes them into playful new configurations.",
            "Never has the \"Marvel Cinematic Universe\" seemed like more of a universe, in ways both good and bad. Infinity War-the title is almost too apt-is far from a perfect movie, but it is probably close to the best movie it could have been. ",

            "Josh Brolin does a fantastic job at bringing Thanos to life via motion capture without drowning under the motion capture. He's a brutal and unapologetic villain and is given an emotional backstory with Gamora that drives this story.",
            "Go see one of the best super-hero films ever made and see it on the biggest screen you can afford.",
            "Expect gasps at the haunting lack of closure. I dug the daring finale. It's every bit as entertaining as it is shocking and refreshing from a franchise that is predictable no more.",
            "For most parts, Avengers: Infinity War largely works and has a lot to offer and take in, but it's not without sacrificial trade-offs and mixed emotions.",
            "Whenever it needs a moment of escalation, it can crank up the score, deliver a big hero money shot and then just allow a decade of storytelling to do the leg-work.",
            "[I]n this age of franchise filmmaking, how am I supposed to accept any consequences when several more movies have already been announced?",
            "A lot is happening at the same time in different parts of the Galaxy, so the story moves quite fast, but attention is key.",
            "Marvel Studios managed to turn dreams into reality. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "More than any other Marvel movie in their ten-year history, this film carries a legitimate edge of peril most don't have. ",
            "It's stuffed full of characters and plotlines and information, and it could've easily become a jumbled mess of over-stimulation. Yet the Russo Brothers ... keep everything moving, interesting and, most importantly, coherent.",
            "Avengers: Infinity Wars, which may well be conceived as the MCU's new testament, the before and after, because, apparently, it starts with the formula to deviate in unsuspected directions. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Infinity War marks a new level of storytelling maturation for the production company: it has gone beyond the laughs and even beyond the ideas - it has stripped the armour and produced the tears. ",
            "A great deal of the movie works remarkably well and sets up a version of the unknown that this shared universe simply hasn't dealt with to this degree.",
            "Infinity War makes good on a decade of character development and plot to deliver a crushing gut punch that will have fans reeling until the second, currently unnamed entry hits theaters in a year. ",
            "They did a pretty good job.",
            "It did have a greater emotional range than a lot of other superhero movies. Because it had those actual consequences, it made it that much more exciting.",
            "The film seems to worship at the altar of tech and a form of awe at the literal manifestations of power.",
            "Even with the two hour and 40 minute running time, it still leaves you wanting more, which, of course, you'll have to wait a year for. "

            "An extremely mixed bag, but for me, the good outweighed the bad. Two hours spent in the Potter universe is always going to be preferable to just about anything else I could be doing.",
            "A bounty of information that seems important even if we're not sure why, where plot turns seem to occur just to keep things exciting, and far fewer fantastic beasts are present than the title implies.",

            "A fantastic reason to see something else this weekend, The Crimes of Grindelwald is a massive disappointment and the prospect of having to sit through three more movies before this story is completed is downright depressing.",

            "The overriding themes of the film are never broadly stated but are subtly revealed, and the horror and reality of war are quietly played out on both the human and panoramic levels with disturbing effect.",

            "Subtlety isn't this movie's strong suit and it's often needlessly chary about drawing the parallel between sexism and racism. But it's got a worthwhile story to tell.",
            "On the Basis of Sex may be rather safe and old fashioned in terms of its filmmaking style. However, it is still a wonderfully accessible biopic.",
            "Felicity Jones, so credible as Jane Hawking in \"The Theory of Everything,\" brings similar credence to the role of Ruth Bader Ginsberg.",
            "It is a film that is quite rightly very proud of the remarkable woman at its focus, and it sometimes feels a little overwhelmed by the occasion. ",

            "Though it has the feel of a TV film, On the Basis of Sex is worth paying to see for Jones' portrayal of Ginsburg's iron will.",
            "One wishes that director Mimi Leder and screenwriter Daniel Stiepleman took a few more chances in their approach to such an incredibly brave and smart woman whose super power was her cogent ability to state her arguments.",

            "Sadly, On the Basis of Sex is just the latest example of remarkable, tough and historically important people being the subject of unremarkable, soft-as-porridge movies designed to placate the elderly and preach to the converted. ",
            "This film did a persuasive and compelling job of painting a portrait of a woman who truly was a path breaker. ",
            "Inspiring film, but this scripted feature does not live up to the RBG documentary. ",
            "Seamlessly shifts between relationship and courtroom drama, but is perhaps so tightly focused that we don't really learn a lot about the woman herself, just the outdatedness of American legislation, some of which still persists today.",

            "Felicity Jones is excellent as the small-statured spitfire that took on numerous males all the way up to the Supreme Court."

            "Kumar is such an amiable lead, and the feminist credentials of his real-life counterpart so rock-solid, that the movie rises above its limitations.",
            "Proves quite the entertaining, daresay absorbing, movie.",
            "The film has the emotional heft of sandpaper.",
            "It's easy to dismiss Pad Man for the same reasons as Toilet: Ek Prem Katha. Both are glorified PSAs with a superstar making a profit out of playing the savior of womanhood...",
            "It's a film that cares about women and their bodies and seeks to normalize conversations that are unnecessarily stigmatized. And in 2018, that's exactly the type of movie we all need to watch.",
            "A well-meaning picture that tackles taboo issues.",
            "Pad Man is an example of how good causes may not always make great cinema.",
            "Padman is sanitised and sweet, and its message is not just to encourage the use of sanitary pads, but that with the right motivation, imagination and a whole lot of patience you can solve problems with ingenuity.",
            "Separately, Kumar's charisma and Muruganantham's saga are remarkable ingredients for any film. Together though, they are Padman's failing and its strength...There is a lot I liked about Padman, but a lot that bothered me about it too.",
            "PadMan left me conflicted because I kept struggling to find the film buried under the heavy-handed messaging, especially in the repetitive first half.",
            "Akshay Kumar's film is well-made, the writing is generally neat. PadMan is by no means a bad film, hiding behind the cloak of social relevance.",
            "The first step for his audience is to acknowledge and shed inhibitions...That itself makes it a worthy cause to watch it, purely for the social message.",
            "The most radical aspect of Pad Man is the fact that the movie exists in the first place. It is rare, indeed unthinkable, to imagine an A-list Bollywood production about a subject like menstruation. ",
            "For all its flaws, Padman, much like its protagonist, puts in a sincere effort. It takes a subject that most Indians are reluctant to talk about and puts it on the marquee, and that alone is worth the applause.",
            "It's Kumar and Apte's show all the way as they take one for the women's team. Make sure to watch this inspirational film this weekend.",
            "Known for making films that work towards bridging the age and gender gap, Balki's Padman is an empowering film that gives you the wings, despite the odds.",
            "The film tackles the \"shame\" that our society insists on imposing on periods, head on. "

            "Padmaavat's sumptuous palace interiors and classically inspired music lend elegance to the film without overpowering it - a welcome shift in tone from the director of the lavish but uneven Devdas and Saawariya. ",

            "Magnificent but overly manufactured.",

            "An extravagant, often gorgeous bore.",
            "Ranveer Singh shines in his portrayal of Bhansali's Khilji as a heartless beast. He is menacing, brutal, passionate, unpredictable and exciting to watch.",
            "While all the actors were earnest in their roles, it's the reductive and predictable plot that lets them down.",
            "No character reaches out; no moment is able to move you. Padmaavat may well be Bhansali's most sterile and insipid outing since Saawariya and Guzaarish. It manages to wear down and exhaust rather than engage.",
            "Padmaavat is spectacular: no one can do spectacle like Bhansali. You can easily delight in it while the going is good. But nearly three hours of it, and looping rhetoric around what constitutes Rajput valour can and does become tiresome.",
            "Padmaavat's disturbing ideology - misogynistic, communal and homophobic - is bad enough. The final nail in the coffin is the lack of chemistry between Deepika Padukone and Shahid Kapoor.",
            "Without the policing and the comprises, Padmavati would've been a lot better film. But Padmaavat isn't anything less. This film is rich in detail, still tells a compelling story with grit and gumption.",
            "Khilji is depraved, crazed, perverted and violent, and yet he is the most interesting character in the film. Credit for that goes to Ranveer Singh, who gives in to Khilji's unhinged personality and makes it his own. ",
            "Granted, it could do with a tauter screenplay and shorter run-time but Padmaavat is an entertaining, large canvas experience, brought to life with Sanjay Leela Bhansali's stroke of visual brilliance."

            "The storytelling ... feels like a rushed, hollow imitation, starring a character whose personality and philosophy are constantly overshadowed by the plot."

            "Despite some close ups that linger on their subjects too long and a timeline that some will find confusing, this is a film that deserves serious consideration. "

            "For every chase or cat-and-mouse sequence, there's another simply about the cold, mundane procedures that make up the lives of the patients, or the uncaring bureaucracy overseeing them. And the latter scenes are just as scary, if not more so.",
            "Sorry, but seeing every freckle in [Claire] Foy's face doesn't make any of this clich\u00e9d portrayal of mental care seem even remotely realistic.",

            "A wickedly clever genre exercise that adds enough twists to a familiar story to keep us guessing.",
            "Is she crazy? Is she not? These questions drive the audience to keep watching the unique imperfect style that was used to tell the story. Claire Foy's performance is astounding!",

            "Fortunately for Kapoor, the performances manage to keep things afloat, taking the emotions to a crescendo matching nature's wrath.",
            "In a film which features flash floods, it's the love story that becomes the disaster. Kedarnath, is indeed a calamity.",
            "The second half has so much stuffed into into it that little makes an impact - including the flood. The narrative races choppily from one disconnected scene to another.",
            "There are many such noble, sensible, contemporary and contentious issues that Kedarnath tries to raise but they somehow get buried in a wishy-washy script that hurtles towards a clumsy, protracted climax. ",
            "What gives Kedarnath a further edge is the solid cast, toplined by the aching chemistry between the lead pair. ",
            "Given the current climate, these inclinations aren't surprising. After all, you know a film is on shaky ground when it's a natural disaster that must rescue it from being a man-made disaster. ",
            "The disaster that strikes the eponymous Himalayan town and an interfaith couple in Abhishek Kapoor's Kedarnath does not spare the film either. ",
            "Kedarnath is a pointless, entirely forgettable film, but some may remember the girl fondly - which may well be the film's only task.",
            "Despite the brisk storytelling and nicely braided scenes that give a vivid sense of the locations, Kedarnath never achieves the emotional peak that is a requirement of the disaster movie.",
            "For a film that ebbs and flows, the leads thankfully keep it afloat and steady. Rajput is wonderful as Mansoor, using his eyes and body language to convincingly convey his character's emotions. But the true revelation is Khan.",
            "Kedarnath dazzles you with its scenic imagery and it's fresh pairing. But it's also a case of missed chances.",
            "Kedarnath is perfectly stormy and is good for a one-time watch.",
            "In trying to please everyone, the film loses edge, and leads to a tepid cop-out. It's a weepie minus the tears.",
            "The clever use of CGI mixed with live-action shots to depict moments like cloudburst and the pilgrim city submerging underwater creates an authentic impact. The execution in these areas, along with a memorable debut by Sara, is what keeps the film afloat."

            "Portuguese action director Jos\u00e9 Padilha (Elite Squad) generates a hurtling momentum, especially as the raid takes shape, but his dialogue scenes are indifferently staged.",
            "The most discernible terror comes not from the hostages huddled in the terminal, who are little more than extras, but from the sense of a director too paralysed by the fear of causing offence to take a perspective.",
            "The film's determination to remain politically even-handed robs much of the drama of any sense of urgency or purpose.",
            "Like the hijacking itself, you can't help feeling it was all for nothing.",
            "It's a film which stays glumly on the tarmac.",
            "How do you tell a thrice-told story a fourth time and keep it fresh? Possibly you don't and can't.",
            "A very average film about a rather remarkable episode in history.",
            "The filmmakers seem committed to sticking to the facts, without exaggerating the drama in any way, which works incredibly well with this particular story.",
            "The only question is, why would anyone pay good money to remake a Charles Bronson TV movie from the 1970s, and do it so badly at that? For that, I have no answers.",
            "Brazilian Director Jos\u00e9 Padilha creates, with meticulous detail, the tension and fear of the terrorists as well as the passengers, but his intention to humanize both doesn't completely connect.",
            "7 Days in Entebbe is absorbing for much of its running time, maintaining interest as it cuts back and forth between the terrorists, the hostages, and the government suits. It's only during the home stretch that the picture largely falls apart.",
            "While stylish in places, the film flops in every conceivable way in tackling weighty philosophical elements against one of the most divisive political situations of the last century.",
            "I think the movie did a good job informing me... However, it can seriously drag and a choice to involve interpretative dance did not work at all.",
            "Fails to capture the emotional and physical toil that seven days in that pressure cooker would do to a person -- this feels more like an intense couple of hours than a protracted siege.",
            "The only unique element that Padilha brings to this workmanlike thriller is an unexpected obsession with politically charged interpretive dance.",
            "On paper this has it all - a plane hijacking, an ideological conflict and a sprinkling of Idi Amin for good measure - but this action drama almost skips over the action and is lacking the drama.",
            "[Entebbe] misses an opportunity to supplement its vision with a voice. ",
            "...high production values and a great cast...",
            "Of the \"seven days\" in the title, days 1 and 7 are considerably more exciting than 2 through 6.",
            "Admirably attempts to tell an important and complex historical event in the context of an accessible thriller.",
            "[The film] is superficial in every aspect... [Full review in Spanish]",
            "I'm sure some will accuse it of making excuses for terrorism or going easy on the hijackers, but that misses the point. It's a heartfelt plea for a peaceful settlement to a seemingly intractable situation. ",
            "Helped by both the screenplay and his fine cast, Padilha has established already that his version is going to be deliberately thought-provoking.",
            "The war-room negotiations are tautly realised. Bruhl and Pike are excellent, as ever... Still, it's hard to see who the film is for. "

            "Not only is there not enough storytelling in A Man of His Word, but the film is also quick to shy away from controversy.",
            "Intended by Wenders to be a personal journey with the Pope, this documentary is more about what the man says that it is about who he is.",
            "Nobody can get angry with the Pope and his message, but the sobering audiovisual form that this work acquires irritates even the most believing of the spectators. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "In the end, Pope Francis - A Man of His Word will turn out to be an enlightening documentary for laymen... but perhaps more conventional for all those familiar with the words and the work of this revolutionary spiritual guide. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Wim Wenders gets close to the Pope by pontificating through discourse. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Only ever remains skin deep; the filmic equivalent of reading from the prayer book and listening to the sermon, rather than interrogating and internalising the words contained within.",
            "It is foolishly unrealistic to expect Wenders to have made any kind of critical or challenging work. The issue is Wenders' inexplicable lack of interest in enriching or expanding the narrative we have come to learn of Pope Francis so far.",
            "You do not have to be Christian, or even religious, to appreciate the man that is Pope Francis.",
            "If you are in any doubt as to the impetus behind the project then look to its title. No film called A Man of his Word is going to draw much blood from the subject.",
            "It's a gentle, generous-spirited tribute to the 266th supreme pontiff that captures much of the warmth and magnetism that have allowed him to bring his message of mercy to migrants and misfits everywhere.",

            "Luca Guadagnino's remake of Italian maestro Dario Argento's surreal 1970s classic is a cauldron of heady ideas and images - but unlike the spine-tingling original, it's just too full to come to the boil.",

            "In creating its own curious mix of history, supernaturalism, queerness and style, the film deserves to be celebrated as an original, truly fearless piece of cinema.",
            "Yet, despite the fantastical, nightmare images, this remake ultimately seems to be more of an exercise in filmmaking than storytelling.",

            "I think the film has loads of potential, but is too bloated as of now.",
            "It's dark, tense, and oozes of evil. "

            "It is not an easy thing to place us into the lives of people we've never had real-life contact with, but this is the stuff that fuels Granik's creativity, and Leave No Trace is a fresh reminder of her talent.",
            "[Granik] strikes a keen balance of examining the characters like an anthropologist would study another culture, but she never becomes too detached.",
            "Leave No Trace is a brilliant examination of family, sacrifice and the price a parent is willing to pay so his child can lead a better life. ",
            "Leave No Trace is a deeply affecting but ultimately universal tale of children leaving home to embark on an independent life. Letting go may be painful, but it's a necessary process.",
            "Delivers something so full of strength and sadness that anyone who calls it slow should have to take a 100-level course in humanity.",
            "Granik has drawn yet another deeply affecting portrait of families who live on the margins - sometimes by choice, often because of circumstance. Her images of poverty are warmly generous, yet free of condescension or romanticisation.",
            "Script, direction, and acting all work together to deliver a story that clearly communicates what is at stake for its characters and what they represent with a rare subtle intelligence.",
            "Leave No Trace will undoubtedly leave many impressions, as it is a beautiful and expertly made film that shouldn't be overlooked.",
            "What I most appreciate about Granik's approach is how she eschews exposition and trusts her leads -- in this case, a terrific Ben Foster in a rare contemplative role, and knock-out New Zealand newcomer Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie.",
            "The simple story touches on themes of trauma and loss, belonging and technology. But it does so effortlessly by focusing on a relationship between a father and daughter.",
            "A father and daughter story of haunting beauty.",
            "Leave No Trace finds its tension in the growing gap between father and daughter as Tom's worldview widens while Will's closes in.",

            "Yet, despite the best intentions of... Gerhard Richter, the director's screenplay has a mini-series superficiality that's reflected in Caleb Deschanel's prettified images of life in Nazi Dresden, Communist East Germany and post-Berlin Wall Dusseldorf.",
            "Watching all three hours of it is like binging a particularly compelling miniseries.",

            "It sounds like a rote rote cop [movie], but the way that Karyn Kusama puts a spin on it: [Destroyer] is really about a woman who cannot deal with her own mistakes... I thought that this film had a real heaviness to it. ",
            "[Kidman's] collaboration with Karyn Kusama, who directed this film, is another example of her willingness to back a filmmaker still to peak.",
            "This uneven and downbeat film will play to small audiences - but that it exists is kind of wonderful.",
            "The film may be flawed and uneven but it provides a platform for its ever-versatile star to give one of her strongest and least characteristic performances.",
            "Destroyer's grim and grubby vision of Los Angeles is a decent enough cover version of the fractured metropolis iconised by Michael Mann in modern noir classics such as Heat and Collateral.",
            "Grunge feminism laid on with a shovel.",
            "Destroyer should have been satisfyingly better than what we got. It deserved more based on Kusama's previous record of Jennifer's Body and The Invitation. Kidman keeps the interest levels high enough, but it's not sufficient to save it in a mix-bag affair",
            "The breadcrumbs never really feel like they're adding up to anything and the mystery, such as there is one, is largely unengaging. ",
            "Nicole Kidman may well be the first performer to deserve Oscars for both Best Actress and Best Supporting actress - for the same role in the same movie.",
            "Is it hollow? Maybe a little. Uneven? Sure. But it's also hypnotic, and it's ultimately worth the wait.",
            "The best crime films find the current of humanity that runs beneath the surface of the action and the gritty atmosphere, and that's where Destroyer delivers.",
            "It suffers from the conventions of cop films. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Nicole Kidman goes through the procedural motions in a bad wig. Gritty, well executed, but nothing else there.",
            "Los Angeles - especially its crumbling eastern sprawl - serves as an evocative backdrop, with cinematographer Julie Kirkwood capturing its shades of pink and beige as the sun hits the sand and concrete.",
            "A largely thrilling endeavor that'll play well in television reruns, but may never find a stronger audience than that.",
            "Interesting, intriguing and different, Destroyer has mystery, action and incredible acting.",
            "\"You look terrible,\" her ex-boss tactlessly informs LAPD detective Erin Bell (Nicole Kidman). He's not wrong.",
            "It is a conventional thriller, that progressively provides nuances of intense existential drama due to the chameleonic interpretation of Nicole Kidman in the role of Erin Bell. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "When you look outside Kidman's performance, what's left is a semi-interesting story made stale by a hackneyed screenplay.",
            "A perfect performance enclosed in a script that's just too sober. This should have been more than a Nicole Kidman vehicle. [Full review in Spanish].",
            "Destroyer mostly successfully channels the crime and cop dramas that come before it... But as the film tries to wind down, it somehow takes itself far too seriously.",
            "Destroyer is a taut, expertly plotted thriller with a career-defining performance from Kidman in her most fearless outing yet",
            "Destroyer brings nothing new to the genre, but the solid job of a nearly unrecognisable Nicole Kidman makes this introspective journey worth it. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "For all its grim, portentous atmosphere, it never achieves the level of self-reflection or genre deconstructionism that it seems to be reaching for."

            "It's acted with naturalistic brio and the script, by Diggs and Casal, is full of pungent dialogue and nuanced reflections on Collin's struggle to avoid becoming a stereotypically angry young black man.",
            "Try and take your electrified eyes off it. It's practically 2018: The Movie.",
            "The film's spell grows and grows, perhaps because we're not sure exactly what the writers and first-time director Carlos L\u00f3pez Estrada are preaching or promoting.",
            "Racism, gentrification, police brutality, start-up culture, corporate branding, social media, the justice system ... Blindspotting is eager to take them all on with style and wit, and it succeeds more often than not.",
            "Wildly energetic, stylish, with an enormous bass-thumping soundtrack and a lot to say about everyday racial relations today...",
            "Dynamic debut director Carlos L\u00f3pez Estrada shows impressive control right from the opening credits, a symbolic series of split screens juxtaposing gritty bodegas on the left with gentrified Whole Foods on the right.",
            "Diggs plays the part refreshingly straight, providing most of the film's resonance.",
            "Diggs and Casal are such a perfect comedy team that I'm going to have to insist that they make a series of road movies together over the next 10 years or so.",
            "What Paul Haggis tried to do with CRASH, BLINDSPOTTING does, putting the Best Picture winner to shame while doing it.",
            "Blindspotting is 95 minutes long, with tight storytelling of a truly compelling narrative that is made all the more intense with the pace it is told at. It's one of reasons it was my favourite film of 2018.",
            "The issues of living in an American city circa 2018-from the justice system to gentrification-tied up with a little poetry, a little anxiety, and a whole lot of Oakland flavor.",
            "Intense performances shine the spotlight on race, poverty, police shootings, guns, education and more current issues in a well paced, well placed, dark comedy capped with a stunning climactic rap poetry slam. ",
            "What feels like the most slept-on film of 2018, Blindspotting is, above all else, a magnificent performance piece.",
            " Blindspotting is enjoyable and entertaining while offering a sober look at some of the things facing our young, black male population, especially in urban settings. ",
            "Brash, funny and sharp",
            " The film sizzles whenever Diggs and Casal share the screen. It's not the kind of film that demands a sequel, but when the end credits come we want a second or third film about the adventures of Collin and Miles.",
            "Blindspotting explores and articulates numerous issues which feel particularly relevant in today's sociopolitical climate, while also serving as a love letter to Diggs and Casal's native Oakland.",
            "Blindspotting opens your eyes to social issues in a way that hasn't been done on screen since Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing. It's slick, funny, and sincere, and one of the year's very best.",
            "An undeniably important movie, Blindspotting steers away from the safe zone and delivers an impressively executed script. [Full review in Spanish].",
            "Blindspotting is a near faultless film - bravely engaging with topical issues while providing a frank, often funny, look at those caught in the mess.",
            "This is a powerful, well-acted film with memorable characters. Director Carlos L\u00f3pez Estrada makes good use of imagery, poetry, drama and humor to illustrate what it is like to live as a troubled black man in a racially divided city.",
            "Has the high-energy crackle and syncopated rhythms of a rap battle, with its buddy comedy format sharing the stage and trading rhymes and times with its deeper societal commentary element to nimble effect."

            "The movie isn't terrible, but it's not especially good either. If the goal was to give Bobby's side of events: flawless victory.",
            "Lifetime's Whitney Houston biopic was confusingly bland, and we're not happy about it.",
            "Here's the thing, as far as standard Lifetime movies go, this was a decent film. But the question is, does Whitney Houston deserve just 'decent,' or does she deserve an HBO miniseries, or a Hollywood film?",
            "A disappointing story that feels superficial and unfinished.",

            "With so much of this family's lives on display, including that of the couple's only child, Bobbi Kristina, it's hard to really buy into the story writer Shem Bitterman is selling.",
            "A successful directorial debut for Angela Bassett.",
            "So \"Whitney\" is an odd mix. The love feels real, and you begrudge them none of it. Yet the problems are just as real, and it's hard to see what could have averted them.",
            "This story is limited in range, refuses to test any boundaries and is content to remain in a safe middle range without ever soaring to heights that might thrill. And because of that, not even the most devoted Whitney Houston fan will always love this."

            "A flawed triumph, emotionally resonant and terrifically acted even when it's biting off more than it can chew.",
            "With Lean On Pete, the director shifts style, totally embracing American colors and practices without losing dramatic effectiveness.",

            "Vox Lux is undone by its self- righteousness.",
            "Despite some unneeded narration by Willem Dafoe that gives the film some slight pretension, Vox Lux still manages to be an ambitious masterpiece.",

            "Corbet abandons the nuanced development of Celeste for a Lady Gaga-Katy Perry mashup, by way of Jersey Shore.",
            "Trauma is the new ennui. That may sound cynical, but Vox Lux is too amoral to be cynical. It's cold and cruel -- maybe even bitter -- but not cynical.",

            "It's all a bit of a mess, but that's part of the point: tragedy and entertainment are intertwined, and the media ruthlessly exploits suffering for eye-grabbing headlines.",

            "...there is much to congratulate Brady Corbet's second feature on. These varying grand ambitions, however, never quite harmonise to full effect, leaving VOX LUX feeling more diminuendo than crescendo as it progresses.",

            "It's a delightful, charming slice of British quirk, helped over the line by Bill Nighy in full national treasure mode.",
            "This quirky film, which takes place in suburban England, won't appeal to everyone, but viewers who enjoy Sometimes Always Never will probably like the film more for the actors' performances than for the movie's somewhat thin plot.",

            "Fundamentally, it's a character piece about Chloe. Aparicio's placid, yet expressive face sometimes recalls Ren\u00e9e Falconetti in The Passion of Joan of Arc. Hers is a brilliant, unmannered performance.",

            "Creed II is almost a match for its predecessor in most respects, and in one its superior.",
            "Jordan is the best thing about the film; vulnerable mouth and defiant, boyish attitude voice (\"I'm dangerous!\" he insists, voice cracking) telegraphing insecurity and impostor syndrome that feels lived in.",
            "Ryan Coogler, having gone on to bigger and bigger things, steps aside and lets relative newcomer Steven Caple, Jr. do the job of mixing the beats of Rocky III and Rocky IV into a smooth groove for the son of Apollo Creed (Michael B. Jordan).",

            "\"Creed II\" not only does the franchise justice, it's further proof of Stallone's lasting creation. I predict at least one more \"Creed,\" then possibly a \"Million Dollar Baby\" style spinoff series with Adonis' daughter Amara to keep the franchise running.",

            "This could be a fascinating look at the franchise's own cyclicality, but Stallone and Taylor don't inject much of any self-awareness in their script. They rely on formula.",
            "Creed II, like the second Rocky film, is a comeback story. It's the tale of a rematch. Unfortunately for the audience, the trajectory of Creed II so closely resembles Rocky II that the film becomes painfully predictable. ",
            "Not quite living up to its predecessor, the Rocky hardcore fan base will still get a major kick at this nostalgic fight back. More Rocky 7 than Creed 2, the first half missed the brilliance of Coogler, but it came back fighting in the second half.",
            "It is a routine sequel weighed down by the most hackneyed components of the genre. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Creed II works best as a story about fathers and sons, and the legacies we are either blessed or cursed with at birth. ",
            "Creed II is hit and miss, but it's a mostly worthy successor to a film so strong, it would almost be impossible to match. Due largely to a cast that brings more to the film than the screenplay can sustain, the movie delivers in most of the right places.",
            "Since it has borrowed from its parent franchise, Creed II's plot devices are pure sports movie pedigree, but, like its predecessor, the direction and performances raise it to a higher level.",
            "reed 2 film doesn't reach the dizzying heights of the original but is still a quasi-satisfying chapter in the Rocky franchise.",
            "Scripted by Stallone and Juel Taylor, Creed II deserves a cheer. ",
            "Stallone has never been one to phone it in, and his script, as silly as it can be, is vintage Rocky. The performances are fantastic as well. ",
            "Overall, Michael B. Jordan knocks it out of the park (or the ring?) again, providing a strong emotional backbone to the movie.",
            "I almost found myself rooting for Viktor Drago to win the final fight, not because of any anti-American sentiment, but because it's always fun to see the actual underdog win.",
            "Creed II is like the best parts of Rocky II-V hot glued together.",

            "The intimate documentary \"Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda\" finds the accomplished composer in a deeply introspective place in both his life and career.",

            "Although it's not on a par with the best of Pixar-Disney, this Warner Bros. release recalls the golden age of Looney Tunes in its energy, inventiveness, and subversive humor.",
            "The songs are a bum note, but the film does raise thoughtful questions about dogma, fake news and the identity crises that might occur once a community's core beliefs are challenged.",
            "It's mostly didactic, tuneless and dull. ",
            "Smallfoot may not be on the level of the best Pixar and Dreamworks efforts but it will make passable half-term viewing for family audiences.",
            "The conceit is nicely done, and the film's unexpectedly heartfelt message about empathy and looking at the world through someone else's eyes just about makes up for its bland animation, smart-arsed script and generic clappy-blah songs.",
            "Beneath the easy slapstick, there's a timely moral too: Don't fear the unknown, embrace it. Just try not to squish it.",
            "You must 'sas-watch' this (sorry).",
            "Smallfoot ends up as a messy mix of socio-theological allegory and straightforward fluff with a narrative that's too often frozen in its tracks.",
            "More than just jesting comedy aimed at younger audiences; it has a deeper message dressed up in woolly warmth and detail. It's delightfully filled with family fun that will leave you feeling warm and fuzzy.",
            "Most of the voice actors are fun and chipper, but it feels like a work that's spending too much effort pandering to younger audience members. ",
            "Smallfoot believes in a community's ability to choose its destiny, as opposed to be kept in the dark for its own good. Good on you, movie.",
            "Overall the movie was cute, but it was not an amazing piece of film-making that we've come to expect from Pixar. It also wasn't a ton of silly jokes like we get from the Illumination Entertainment team but it's a good step forward for WAG after Storks.",
            "[The film's] simplistic binary between faith and science dangerously obscures the more nuanced reality.",
            "Small Foot will also provoke controversy, especially from religious groups. Depending on one's viewpoint, Small Foot can make the argument either for or against organized religion.",
            "though there's not enough of the Wile E. Coyote-style slapstick, it's a lot of amiable fun for the kids",
            "Packed with enough charm and goodwill to entertain all children of all ages. ",
            "When we've all been spoiled prior with clever animation that mixes wit and whimsy with such ease, a product like Smallfoot can't help but feel a little ordinary.",
            "This is a fun film that the whole family can enjoy.",
            "It's sort of weird but it was creative.",
            "This is a fun, although imperfect, kids movie that actually has something to say about the way we treat those we see as \"other\". That alone makes it worth the ticket, but there's also a hip-hop opus by Common that's too good to miss.",
            "It may not become a classic but it is still a fun watch.",
            "Mediocre, but alert adults will at least appreciate the message about the need to reject \"alternative facts\" spouted by fear-mongering leaders.",
            "The progressive message elevates this kid-friendly entertainment into something far more meaningful. ",
            "The central joke in Smallfoot is a bit corny, but if you can get past it, you'll find a fairly charming little family picture."

            "It doesn't try to be funny, it just effortless is. It's a heartfelt joy with a commendable stab at social commentary. A roller coaster of a ride this is one sequel and superhero movie that beats the enemy with graceful joy.",
            "This is a by-the-numbers redux of the first Incredibles movie - it's fun to watch, but it's too predictable to be truly gripping.",
            "It's nice to see that the fourteen year wait was worth it.",
            "It turns out that there not only is a place for such a richly animated work like Incredibles 2, but that it seems almost imperative that it exists to remind us that it's not impossible for these films to have a beating heart behind the chest emblem.",

            "On a whole, it's still fun and cute.",
            "Incredibles 2 might be a cash grab for NYSE:DIS, but, thankfully, not the artists behind the project. Here's a rare sequel that matches the original by narrowing its focus.",
            "Incredibles 2 gets an easy pass on character strength alone.",
            "While original, witty and super entertaining, this 14-year sequel also poses as a cautionary tale for future Pixar \"family films.\" Disappointing in that regard",
            "It's a genuine crowd pleaser that rewards viewing on the big screen, which is what a summer movie is all about.",
            "The plot is compelling, there are plenty of laughs and the message is contemporary.",

            "A grim example of the worst impulses of Hollywood filmmaking in the 2000s given unfettered room to flourish.",
            "For the second half of the film, it's all chase and chase and chase some more, with little audience involvement in how it turns out.",
            "The Island is very much a Michael Bay film, with all of the stylistic touches that entails.",

            "Even though Mrs. Hyde loses the trees for the forest, any movie starring Huppert is radiant, and it should be evident that tossing in a special effect or a message will be superfluous.",
            "The setup is laborious, but the payoff made me roar.",
            "Maybe it's only fitting that a Jekyll-and-Hyde tale would be of two minds. Unfortunately, neither of them is completely satisfying.",
            "Mrs. Hyde has its keen moments, but it lacks a thesis. If it were a term paper, any conscientious teacher would send it back for a rewrite.",
            "Whenever the movie tries to say something insightful about racial integration - or education, or any number of issues - it backs off or bogs down. It's so tonally and ideologically unfocused that its ideas just slip away.",
            "Mrs. Hyde is a social commentary that packs a punch wrapped in a screwball comedy form. Highly recommended. ",
            "Although Mrs. Hyde leaves a lot to be desired, its storytelling wobbly, not for an instant did I feel that Huppert, now 65, was repeating herself.",
            "Madame Hyde is a film that has many virtues, not the least of which is its willingness to go against the current. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Bozon has always been fond of the vivacity of classic cinema - he development of a film of sparkling calligraphy, where treasonous camera movements top off some scenes with the kinetic energy of a slapstick's own slip. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Bozon's film does what other films believe and do not really do: It gives an account the passing of time, of the prevailing tedium, of the frustrations and desires of a mature woman. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "[The film's writerst] are not afraid to mix genres...That singularity makes Madame Hyde refreshing despite rekindling such vague concepts as Stevenson's novel about duality or the French subgenre of suburban educational dramas. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Bozon delivers another example of his highly distinctive universe, and allows Huppert free reign, who seems to revel in playing a character who veers from neutralized to, well, radioactive.",
            "There are problems with Mrs. Hyde that have nothing whatsoever to do with Bozon's puzzling creative choices, though for perspective's sake, the problems are dwarfed by the choices. ",
            "A strange, ingenious film.",
            "Perhaps its greatest lesson isn't within the movie, but rather the fact of it: rather than revise a stale genre, burn it anew.",
            "Bozon...seems perversely committed to frustrating not just conventional audience expectations but also any hope whatsoever that one might have for narrative and/or thematic coherence.",
            "As in Stevenson's story, the unleashing of Marie's latent furies inevitably veers toward horror, infusing Bozon's sociological satire with bitter ironies about the forces of order and the uses of disorder.",

            "As a movie about teaching, though, Madam Hyde works wonderfully. In contrast, the supernatural aspects of the film often feel tacked on and out of place. ",
            " It's refreshing to watch Isabelle Huppert's madcap dash of a performance, playing a character constantly at war with herself and who she wants to be in life. ",
            "The film's segregated world hints at a town's (and country's) racial tensions without actually examining them."

            "In the right hands, this might have been great.",
            "The film is charming, even with the usual Disney paw prints on the themes. Forster handles the comedy with skill and the sentiment with restraint.",
            "A better title for this entry, the first of the Disney Poohs to be live action (although neither word in that phrase is an apt descriptor), would be Winnie the Pooh and the Unfilled Zoloft Prescription.",
            "It's a delicious movie to see in these last, lazy days of August, when summer has slowed not quite to nothingness but at least to the bliss of a warm day that begins with a bird's song and ends without a worry as to what work has not been done by dusk.",
            "A gently sweet film which, without realising its early melancholic promise, aims a little higher than the bear necessities required of a Disney merchandising cash cow.",
            "It's difficult to know who this downbeat film is for exactly.",
            "An endearing movie for the whole family.",
            "It's a film that will mostly make you long for a more traditional Pooh tale.",
            "Sometimes you go into a remake skeptically thinking \"Why bother?\" and exit so pleasantly surprised that you do your best impression of the honey bear, \"Oh, bother.\"",
            "The script is more Frankenstein's monster than cuddly, and its flaws are the most fascinating parts about it.",
            "Beautifully shot, the story, however, lacks any remarkable originality. It doesn't offer anything new and quite frankly, we have all seen this before.",
            "The film is harmless, full of thoughtful questions about what it is to be a grown up, and a bit of fun when all is said and done. ",
            "For the kid in all of us, this nostalgic look good, feel good film reminds the world to slow down and appreciate the little things.",
            "The acting and voice acting are equally enjoyable. Not only can you believe these characters are who they're telling us they are, but the performances have the ability to convince you you're close or can relate. ",
            "Mostly, this film works as ideal family entertainment, a genre that grows rarer and rarer at the Cineplex. It wears its heart on its sleeve and in this cynical world, that's as sweet as honey.",
            "It's to Christopher Robin's credit that instead of sighing at the predictability of such an ending, I just wished it was true that all it took to lift the fog and make the sun shine again was a hug and a few kind words from a sentient plush. It's sweet.",
            "As a movie, Christopher Robin works pretty decently overall.",
            "As any artist or creator will attest, along with Pooh, it is often the 'unproductive' spaces and 'irrelevant' explorations that lead to the best things.",
            "Hitting all the heartwarming Disney buttons, Christopher Robin rediscovers his inner child, and you may too.",
            "You don't want to miss the innocence and warmth of this story.",
            "The problem is that it does not offer anything special to be remembered or simply recommended. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "It feels admirable rather than excellent, and once every so often it feels like an absolute delight.",
            "An engrossing film for the children we were. It is melancholy, magical and might be a little too much for kids wanting a fun filled Winnie the Pooh adventure. ",
            "There's something hauntingly elegiac about Christopher Robin, almost if it is somehow as much about putting aside childish things as it is about recapturing one's childhood."

            "Even for viewers who aren't particularly religious, the soul of Perlman's music will make the documentary a spiritually uplifting experience.",
            "The moments during which Perlman is performing are breathtaking. Seeing his emotions as he plays and the bond he shares with his violin is wondrous.",
            "If you thought musical genius, by definition, would be intimidating, the documentary Itzhak should go a long way toward changing your mind.",

            "Chernick and her quartet of cinematographers and her probably overworked seamstress, editor Helen Yum, have created an entertaining, crowd-pleasing salute to a virtuoso whose life is truly inspirational.",
            "Watch it, listen to the music, and experience the joy of Perlman's genius.",
            "Watching [Itzhak Perlman] onscreen removed from his art and yet still so connected to it becomes our education and ultimately inspiration.",
            "The PBS-styled doc doesn't exactly explore Itzhak Perlman's hidden depths, but heck, that's what the music is for.",
            "Fine and joyful documentary.",
            "Chernick has made an engaging film about an ordinary guy who happens to also be an extraordinary musician. ",
            "It feels intimate in a way that so many documentaries about a specific person often do not.",
            "The film occasionally touches upon dark subjects - we're told so many Jewish people played the violin during the Holocaust because was it was the easiest instrument to pick up and run away with - but Itzhak's primary modality is joy."

            "There have been several Denzel Washington films over the years that were worthy of sequels and the seasoned actor surely considered the merits of each one. That's what makes his choice of the utterly disposable The Equalizer 2 such a mystery.",

            "While the child actors are often excellent, they don't get much to say, and it's asking a lot for boys of primary-school age to express soulful depths through glances alone.",
            "It is a thing of beauty: too beautiful perhaps, running a real danger of prettifying poverty.",
            "This movie is so gorgeous, it even makes drone footage look ethereal rather than pedestrian.",
            "The conclusion is certain enough to be practically foregone, and if what leads up to it is aggressively arty, it's also artful and frank, a rare combination.",
            "Zagar builds a world that is simultaneously deeply authentic and dreamlike - the perfect combination to express a child's deeply felt but inherently distorted view of the universe he inhabits.",
            "One of the best of the year so far.",
            "Jeremiah Zagar's debut fiction feature is a frequently striking, feverish pre-adolescent snapshot, though without much narrative meat on its bones.",
            "It's a strange ride, but in the best possible way.",
            "It resorts to manipulation and trite condescension to eagerly reiterate a politically correct discourse. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Director Jeremiah Zagar (with co-screenwriter Daniel Kitrosser) creates a child's vision of a world filled with beauty and sheer terror.",
            "...a beautifully realised film that owes a great debt to a number of cinematic forebears. Although this may prevent it from becoming a cultural touchstone for others, it is nevertheless a rhythmic story that sweeps you into its coming-of-age tale.",
            "Without a trace of luridness, We the Animals manages to be heartbreaking and harrowing. What saves it from being depressing is the exhilaration of Zagar's direction, and the unbridled energy and unstudied authenticity of the cast.",
            "Rarely does a first film reach the strength and emotional weight that [director Jeremiah] Zagar has achieved in this debut. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Beautiful coming-of-age drama is slightly undermined by its own artistic tendencies.",
            "A work that acutely grasps the emotional dissonance borne of family ties.",
            "A heartbreaking lyrical coming-of-age drama.",
            "But for anyone who saw and liked the indie likes of Mud, Mid90s and in particular The Florida Project, this is well worth checking out.",
            "A gay coming-of-age drama set in a poor household and presented in a humid, impressionistic style, Jeremiah Zagar's film risks being a box-ticking example of a trendy indie.",
            "One of the discoveries of the year so far.",
            "It deals with difficult subject matter with extreme grace.",
            "The joys and fears of childhood are wonderfully evoked in this intense and painterly drama from Jeremiah Zagar.",
            "The movie lacks the book's ferocious impact (best not to read it before watching) but, shot on 16mm film, it has a dreamy, lyrical beauty.",
            "Working with writer Daniel Kitrosser, Zagar achieves something magical with an adaptation that's akin to films like Moonlight, Mustang and The Florida Project.",
            "We the Animals is beautiful in a visceral way - more guts than heart."

            "Westwood's more recent collections are amply displayed, and her style hasn't changed much in 40 years; aside from a few smart suits, most of her outfits are loud, vainglorious political statements.",
            "Fashion, for all its seeming frivolity, is a grimly serious business. [Vivienne] Westwood showed an endearing grace, sowing the seeds of future national treasure status.",
            "Lorna Tucker's documentary portrait focuses equally on what happened afterwards, painting its subject as a committed activist, an artist with no time for convention or false modesty, and a personality worth spending time with.",
            "The film is a fair and, I think, a well-meaning attempt to cover her life in all its dizzying variety - hence the scattiness.",
            "Westwood's loyalties feel torn and the fashion house is plunged into drama. It makes this the perfect film to double bill 'Phantom Thread' with. ",
            "The best anecdote is saved for the closing credits, for some reason. ",
            "The doco arguably dwells a bit too long on Westwood's role in London punk rock culture wars of the 1970s, but never bores for a moment.",
            "Westwood: Punk, Icon, Activist reveals a plethora of contradictions in its subject, and that makes the whole piece all the more intriguing and mysterious. ",
            "If you're a free spirit, you'll enjoy this spirited backward glance at a great British designer, provocateur, businesswoman, whose smash-the-box approach continues to inspire in these dull gray days of our despair.",
            "Westwood: Punk, Icon, Activist is a documentary that is fairly well-round about a fantastic lady of fashion who is also a passionate activist and punk rock as can be. ",
            "Westwood may be intriguing for fashion types, punk-rockers and fans of septuagenarian women with potty mouths and trophy husbands, but it may be a harder sell for cinephiles who like their docs with a little more revelation.",
            "Amusing gloss on a punk fashion icon who never gave up the safety pins. ",
            "It's a nice little documentary that doesn't dare to dig too deep, mostly covering the varying of chapters of Westwood's life quickly while avoiding any and all controversy.",
            "There's plenty of interesting archival footage, as well as great contextualising commentary from the people around the dame.",
            "Obviously, Westwood is a great talent, and her career stands for itself. But the Westwood who sits for director Lorna Tucker's camera doesn't seem to want to be there and tells her story - barely - with no excitement.",
            "Lorna Tucker's study of Vivienne Westwood is amiable enough but has its detractors.",
            "This smartly paced, good-looking doco celebrates her often cantankerous and very unique approach to getting things done...",
            "Where the film does comes alive though is in the behind-the-scenes footage of her critquing her own collection, or how it is being portrayed.",
            "Director Lorna Tucker's profile of the designer is intermittently inspired by its subject's world-weary attitude, but, hewing close to a familiar fashion doc template, it often makes Westwood's life and work seem more ordinary than edgy.",
            "Filmmaker and former model Lorna Tucker presents an intriguing portrait of the artist that captures the poles of her personality. ",
            "Westwood is proof that fashion and political audacity have no age limit.",
            "\"Westwood\" is definitely better than mediocre, though you wish there were a bit more to it.",
            "We get a pointed view into the difficulties Westwood faced in gaining acceptance in her home country and how her persistence and vision won out in the end. It's damn inspiring.",
            "Less comprehensive biography than grumpy, captivating depth charge. "

            "All said and done, Motwane breaks into new territories with his innovative take on superhero films. Bhavesh Joshi Superhero has its heart in the right place and its tone is totally indigenous.",
            "The film's flaw is that it's trying to say too much and doing so at such a painful pace that much of a good intention is lost in execution.",
            "There is much to like here - the atmospherics, Painyuli's performance that is notches above Kapoor's, and Motwane's feel for noir, but his home-grown hero still falls short. Hopefully this will be a franchise...",
            "The problem with Vikramaditya Motwane's fourth directorial venture isn't that it soars too high. Its problem is that it simply doesn't get off the ground. And this is definitely not for want of trying.",
            "In the film the issue feels too flat and tame. Somewhere Motwane gets too self-aware and conscious-be it the genre of superhero cinema he is playing with or the issue of corruption itself. The point gets belaboured and the film too protracted.",
            "The over-stretched thriller is also a stark reminder of the troubled times we live with mob justice and digital warriors shaping public opinion.",
            "It doesn't entirely succeed, but Vikramaditya Motwane's take on the superhero genre is worth a look.",
            "Bhavesh Joshi Superhero works beautifully until the interval point before gradually losing its way to laboured plotting, implausible twists and banal moralising.",
            "The film flirted with the concept of a common man being influenced by graphic novels and superhero movies to become a vigilante...it makes a case for a proper superhero origins film."

            "Scattered and self-indulgent, a career retrospective in search of a coherent theme.",
            "Greenfield's titillating survey of America's grossest obsessions, from plastic surgery to porn, only flirts with economic and social context, mainly limiting itself to observation and personalization.",
            "\"Generation Wealth\" feels like it's all over the place, and that, if most of its subjects are lacking in depth, the movie itself is open to the same criticism.",
            "If \"Generation Wealth\" has a message that empty acquisitiveness is bad, it delivers it, like the rest of her work, by showing, not telling.",
            "It could read as smug, holier-than-thou hand-wringing but, interestingly, Greenfield chooses also to implicate herself.",
            "I wouldn't avoid this documentary like the plague, but I would save it for home viewing when you think about investing money with a mysterious stock broker.",
            "The result is something of an indulgent, catch-all mess.",
            "Despite the film's tired observations and lack of self-awareness, it's really just a giant ad for Greenfield herself.",
            "It's slightly indulgent, but most of the great autobiographies are, and the end result manages -- almost against the odds -- to blend the personal and the professional in ways I didn't think were possible. ",
            "Generation Wealth is an unsatisfyingly superficial crash course in that enduring idea, a kind of omnibus of the photographer's fixations coalesced into one top-heavy, meandering production.",
            "What happens when those who live fast don't die young.",
            "It is not about the today's truly wealthy, which is a missed opportunity.",
            "Despite its focus on materialism, Generation Wealth ends up as a tribute to loved ones, who bring richness to life that money cannot.",
            "Greenfield's takeaway -- money doesn't buy happiness, family is important, status is illusory -- feels too pat. It also ignores a larger point: The people here who claim not to want money are the people who've had it and lost it.",
            "Whilst it suffers from a lack of focus at times, it's a well-made and thought-provoking insight into our strange new world.",
            "By being both sprawling and personal, Greenfield forces us to look at how we are all complicit in this culture that prizes wealth. ",
            "Maybe society is just so afflicted with its wealth sickness that looking at all the symptoms of the illness makes it impossible to craft a compelling diagnosis of how the infection started and spread.",
            "What we get is a film that is most fun when observing the cautionary lifestyles of the once-rich and adjacent-to-famous, but most insightful when it pulls outs of the fast lane and Greenfield's eye turns inward on her own life.",
            "The degree of difficulty here is off the charts, and the wildly uneven results only make the achievement of Kirsten Johnson's Cameraperson all the more impressive.",
            "The film is not so much a documentary about how greed and money are destroying society as it is an autobiographical look at Greenfield's obsession with the lifestyles of the rich and the famous. ",
            "But as in so much of this sprawling meditation-an odd mix where the heinously crass often outweighs the authentically beautiful-deep analysis is lacking.",
            "Greenfield's film is all over the place, and is more stream of consciousness than informative or even entertaining.",
            "Generation Wealth falls victim to the very thing that it is attempting to critique, namely excess. Quite simply, there is too much stuff in here."

            "No words are spoken towards the end, just a text followed by a seamless shot at dusk, and it's perfect.",
            "Mosellle isn't breaking that much new ground here. But what is fresh and different is that she never judges, punishes or, most importantly, exploits her character's behavior.",
            "It transcends the common boundaries of Hollywood filmmaking and becomes a living spiritual entity, encompassing the essence and tone of youth.",
            "A fantastically evocative low-key tale of a teenage girl's coming of age within the skate subculture of New York City.",
            "Like executing a gravity-defying trick, you can't overthink things ... This film, unfortunately, doesn't land the trick. Nor does it fall too hard, though.",
            "The view Moselle gives us of this subculture is intimate and occasionally a little strange, but every second is captivating.",
            "Skate Kitchen is a highly realistic and believable narrative feature, populated with non-professional actors playing versions of themselves. Not much happens. What does happen is natural and relevant. And the film is terrific.",
            "Forget those glossy dystopias studios force on younger audiences. American indies are going directly to the source to portray adolescents.",
            "The quasi-documentary from The Wolfpack director Crystal Moselle will grind its way into your heart. ",
            "They are non-professional actors playing versions of themselves, and the naturalism of their conversations--and of their gliding excursions through the streets of Manhattan--is wonderful. ",
            "On a skateboard, there's no room for thinking. It's just feeling and doing, which is what makes it such a symbol of emancipation in Crystal Moselle's joyful and wise new film.",
            "There's a sweet nostalgia and important moments, those magical, too brief weeks of summer vacation and the bliss of finally finding a place you belong.",
            "A minor-key coming-of-age triumph that manages to simultaneously be relatable and wildly distinctive. Will almost certainly have lapsed, adult skateboarders (unwisely) dusting down their decks.",
            "Thanks to Moselle's unfussy direction, which really captures the feeling of drifting along through youthful summer days, and the strong work of the young, mostly little-known cast, Skate Kitchen is certainly worth your time.",
            "A film that addresses teen sexuality, gender identity, drug use and more in ways that feel neither prurient nor exploitative; just raw and honest.",
            "Authentic and dreamily shot - yet smartly edited - Skate Kitchen is the kind of movie you feel infinitely more hip just for watching."

            "\"Dark Money\" exposes the dangers of unbridled, anonymous political spending so expertly that it will make you fume with anger, practically quake with distress.",
            "The film's basic problem is that it jumps around too much... Still, Reed and her team have boiled down their presentation to a manageable 99 minutes that's fascinating, absorbing, and mind-altering. ",
            "The undue influence of money on elections is not exactly news, but the ways in which that influence can now be secured, given the current state of the law, certainly is. ",
            "\"Dark Money\" takes a detailed look at an unexpectedly complex situation that is at the heart of political action today.",
            "Activist in tone, and paced like a thriller, Reed's movie painstakingly details how an election can be brusquely seized and swayed by unseen forces.",
            "Engrossing, lucid, and unsettling...",
            "Dark Money should be required viewing.",
            "The movie is expertly researched and informative and provides a clear timeline and path toward the destruction of our democracy if these practices remain unchecked. It may not be your idea of the perfect summer movie, but it's a powerful documentary.",
            "Director Kimberly Reed has made one of the most important films in years.",
            "This Sundance-heralded doc is at times a lot of fun, but it never lets us forget that the joke could be on us.",
            "However, where Dark Money succeeds is where so many other political docs fail: it offers a buffet of solutions to the problem at heart, and all seem feasible enough to inspire action from even the most skeptical political cynics. ",
            "Director Kimberly Reed smartly grabs our attention by using the gorgeous and thinly populated state of Montana as a microcosm for the ongoing corruption of the election process.",
            "Using the serene beauty of the Montana mountains as a backdrop for the pulsing thriller, Adams acts as the film's heartbeat...",
            "Reed does a masterful job pulling this all together, letting the people in Montana speak, and allowing the audience to draw their own conclusions about the national problem. ",
            "Excellent political docu has infrequent profanity. ",
            "There's a lot of information, but it's all given proper context with which to comprehend its explosive ramifications.",
            "A refreshing reminder that Montana has never lost the anti-corporate ethos that enabled it to pass a law in 1912 banning Koch brothers type campaign funding.",
            "Though it's uneven in its execution, its informative narrative however has an impact and is worth seeing.",
            "The film does a great job in explaining and reminding the audience how dark money works in different scenarios, throughout the unfolding of the film's journeys",
            "Bone chilling and eye opening.",
            "An expose of how political campaigns are being funded with little or no disclosure of where the money is coming from.",

            "Dark Money does succeed in presenting a strong case for campaign finance reform.",
            "Reed's investigation becomes an inadvertent sequel to Merchants of Doubt, which emphasizes how corporate big money has influenced politics through lobbying groups."

            "I'm not entirely sure why the film works. Its a blithe disinterest in telling a conventional story will leave some viewers, even discerning ones, feeling unsatisfied.",
            "At 69 minutes, \"Claire's Camera\"...is among Hong's shortest movies. But it feels complete, just the right amount of time to spend part of a weekend at Cannes with some charmingly dysfunctional people.",
            "The actors are all terrific. Jung makes So so self-aware that you can, at least for a time, abide his abject selfishness. Nam is complex; she's difficult to like at first, but she has reasons for her behavior.",
            "\"Claire's Camera\" runs 68 minutes and is as slender and unassuming, in its own way, as a Polaroid. But you may emerge from it not feeling like quite the same person, either.",
            "Hong is an acute observer of the subtleties at play in each interaction, of the tiny power shifts that can take place over the course of a conversation.",
            "Claire's Camera is, like many of Hong's best comedies before it, amusing without necessarily being laugh-out-loud funny.",
            "With no desire to camouflage his apparent lack of concern for the technical part of the production, the director is sane but aseptic narrating his story in images. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "A fish-out-of-water comedy that finds gentle humor in misunderstandings and barriers of language.",
            "\"Claire's Camera\" is a film that fans of the director will definitely enjoy. However, at times it got me thinking what was its point, considering that this is the third production of a director who shoots similar films, in one year",
            "The story is a sly, whimsical tale about affairs, communication and jealousy, all tied together by the charming presence of Claire (Huppert).",
            "Claire's Camera is not among the director's best efforts and yet, has the power to captivate us with its lightness, effortless spontaneity, and instinctive charm.",
            "[Director Hong Sang-soo] allows the audience to think, to see the films through their own lens and give the work a different perspective -- just as Claire can be seen forming her own impression of her new friends in Claire's Camera.",
            "Claire's Camera is the cinematic equivalent of milk ice tea. It doesn't really add up to much substantially. But it's sweet, looks nice and it goes down smooth. Kim Min-hee singing children's songs is worth the price of admission.",
            "What, at first, seems like a compact comedy of errors or a tangential riff on spontaneous relationships and ephemeral existences becomes a more fruitful study in finding the hidden meanings of life within the workaday.",
            "Isabelle Huppert is so natural. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "In Claire's Camera, what [Director Hong Sang-soo] does is establish co-existence, without leaving the diegetic limits, [of] frozen representation and the temporal flow that continues over it. [Full review in Spanishi]",
            "Perfect. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "Only Hong Sang-soo could notice the naturalness of a place as contrived as Cannes during the festival. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "Reluctant to film the great work, Sangsoo continues to explore the fusion of film and life camouflaging the complexity of lightness. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "[Director] Hong Sang-soo presents the best cinephile route via Cannes. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "As for his style, Hong loves to linger. If he feels his actors are riffing on each other, he'll just let the camera roll. ",
            "Watching Claire's Camera feels like watching a film being made right in front of you.",
            "Enjoyable and charming.",
            "Though [Isabelle] Huppert's billing is sure to garner the most attention, the film belongs to Kim as much as Hong's On the Beach at Night Alone. "

            "A dazzling, endearing story that will appeal to classic film buffs and history aficionados. It's light and breezy in contrast to other documentaries and that's just fine.",
            "I get that many Americans are captivated by the celebrity mystique, but many of the hotel's customers are anonymous billionaires. At least I can finally sleep at night knowing that they're always comfortable at the Carlyle.",

            "So it's mostly about the staff, as well as the caf\u00e9 and lounge and other tony accommodations you'll never experience, making Always at the Carlyle celebrity-lifestyle porn.",

            "[I]t remains a powerful story with a rousing finale, thanks in no small part to Morgan Kibby's score, and the gorgeous, sunlight-in-dust cinematography.",
            "On paper, Girls of the Sun boasts about as badass and culturally relevant of a premise that one is likely to find, but in practice Husson's adaptation of the story is rather limp.",
            "Despite excellently-staged action, Husson tries to juggle one too many character arcs, which ends up blurring our focus of the bigger picture at hand.",

            "The high wire work of Malek and the thrilling concerts sequences will make you fall in love with Queen all over again. While far from perfect, Bohemian Rhapsody was a blast.",
            "Thanks to the film's aesthetically pleasing musical sequences and Rami Malek's commanding leading performance, it still serves as an adequate reminder of both the band's musical genius and Freddie's one of a kind stage presence.",
            "The film never really strikes an original note, choosing instead to tap into all the biopic high notes.",
            "Rami Malek is the movie and the only reason why it stands out, not much beyond his acting. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "The film clearly has its flaws, rolling out more like a \"Greatest Hits\" compilation than a creative concept album, but the experience is so nostalgically infectious as to be irresistible. Forget the mixed reviews; they're just radio gaga.",
            "The film is either scared of alienating its audience or can't bring itself to paint Mercury in a light that isn't totally mainstream, but either way, it's shallow.",
            "More bubblegum pop than gritty heartbreaking drama, Bohemian Rhapsody may have a few flaws but it is, without a doubt, made for its hardcore fan base. It's engaging, foot-tapping and one all-around rocking respectful party.",
            "Mercury's deeply flawed personality is brilliantly brought out in all its contradictions by Malek.",
            "Bohemian Rhapsody was made to pay tribute to Freddie, not to explore his personal life. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "There are a great number of problems with Bohemian Rhapsody, but the passion for and behind the band is front and center, and that occasionally makes it a great deal of fun.",
            "It is brutally long, rushing to tell the hectic life of Freddie Mercury with very awkward creative decisions and conventional mechanics that make the journey hasty, pointless and with little time for cohesion. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "As a biopic, Bohemian Rhapsody falls short, failing to adequately examine Mercury's life and the people in it. Malek, who put so much effort into bringing Mercury to life, and who gives such a brilliant performance, deserves better, as does the audience.",
            "Overall, this is nothing new. Neither good nor bad, but if you approach it from the right angle, it's a lot of fun. ",
            "Bohemian Rhapsody dives into the struggles that Freddie Mercury went through. Whether you are a Queen fan or not, it makes for a great drama (with awesome music!).",
            "This is record label-approved hagiography, and those doing the approving seem to see Mercury's sexual orientation as a character flaw he must overcome.",

            "Bohemian Rhapsody is an expensive cosplay. It is plotted with the passion of a Wikipedia summary article. It hums along inoffensively for 2 hours. "

            "If Asante's idea is that Nazi ideology poisoned bright young minds into viewing their fellow citizens as less than human, the lovey-dovey bond she's pushing as the main event seems even more implausible.",

            "In the end it feels like a school play, and not a very good one.",
            "Where Hands Touch is a coming of age story, a saga of war, and a heart-rending love story about a forbidden romance that defied the odds against survival in a living hell.",
            "Asante usually excels at sharing stories audiences haven't seen before, so it's unfortunate that this one feels so dully familiar.",
            "A gut-wrenching misfire.",
            "Where Hands Touch still manages to be a well-acted historical drama that depicts World War II from a different point of view. It also retains the same theme of finding your identity that Amma Asante has demonstrated in her previous work.",
            "It is Leyna's relationship with her mother (and her own identity) that is perhaps the most moving aspect of the film. Amandla Stenberg gives a fantastic performance here as a young woman who is struggling to find her place in the world.",
            "Possibly with a different screenwriter, or even a different cast, Where Hands Touch might have been something truly great. Unfortunately, as it is, it's very middle ground fare that neither moves, engages, or informs - it simply exists.",
            "While Where Hands Touch has its tender moments, and manages to draw some teary eyes, its central romance becomes more outlandish as the film progresses, becoming borderline distasteful.",
            "Where Hands Touch certainly doesn't deserve its viral meme infamy - it's a far more nuanced movie than that suggests - but it also will not join the pantheon of its director's finest moments.",
            "I found myself looking at it and liking certain parts, but I didn't get emotionally swept up...but it great that the film happened, in itself there's a sense of relief and triumph there... ",
            "In a disappointing turn from Asante, an important and vital narrative is lost in a bizarre and over-dramatic love story.",
            "A frustratingly wasted opportunity.",
            "It's a fascinating take on the horrors of World War II and one that confirms [Amandla] Stenberg as one of the most accomplished rising stars of her generation. ",
            "Where Hands Touch is ultimately let down by a deeply contrived narrative and tone-deaf melodramatic style which only serves to diminish the importance and urgency of the real life stories behind Assante's screenplay.",
            "Patchy acting, questionable accents and a clunky screenplay that tamely wends its way down a lazy river of fawning predictability, further hamper a film that screams for the authenticity and inventiveness of Asante's previous directorial outings.",
            "Dramatically it's a mixed bag, but Where Hands Touch does offer some moments of magic.",
            "Casting Amandla Stenberg as Leyna in the starring role was an excellent choice.",
            "It isn't the implausibility of the script which causes this film's failure, it's the inability to create complex or practical characters from these fragments of reality. ",
            "While Asante's earlier films were grounded in reality and successfully linked the problems facing their protagonists to contemporary aspects of racism, Where Hands Touch seems unduly contrived.",
            "The performances are affecting, particularly George MacKay... deft direction...",
            "With such a film as Where Hands Touch, and with the times we are living in, with the alt-right being validated by our current president, the film would have made a much stronger point if it focused on biracial Germans without a Nazi love interest. ",
            "While not hitting the heights it could have, Where Hands Touch is a reminder that there are plenty of stories from this era that have yet to be told."

            "In a landscape often coldly desaturated by the camera, the plot is secondary to the gripping performances. The scene where an angry, grieving Moosa goes to a factory to confront someone he blames is a scarifying tour-de-force.",

            "Despite the compelling chemistry between Winstead and Common, the film drags when it fixates on their relationship and the contrived obstacles that befall it.",
            "A major strength of the film is the ensemble work of Winstead and Common, who together have a believable, warm chemistry.",
            "What is fresh about the film is that rather than be a set up for a climactic biographical confession, it so carefully paints the toxic environment women have to negotiate that her anger doesn't really feel like it needs explanation.",
            "What could have been a portrait of female fame and notoriety in 2018 ends up as just a tiresome, played-for-shocks romance.",
            "Eva Vives has made an important and powerful film, against some odds. She's a woman and Hispanic. She refused to make Nina \"nicer.\" It isn't surprising that funding was hard to come by. ",

            "... suffers from contrivances along the way, but generates genuine sympathy for Nina beneath her fragile yet abrasive exterior.",

            "\"Chef Flynn\" seems more suited for an hour-long show on the Food Network. Its 82-minute running time, although short for a feature film, seems too bloated for this story.",
            "Whether hitting a curveball or creating haute cuisine, there is something fascinating about watching a precocious talent at work.",

            "Because we only follow Flynn into his mid teens, we don't get to see how all this turns out, but what we do get is a portrait of a young man at a critical stage in his career, and a glimpse of the drive it takes to realise a childhood dream.",
            "The viewer is handed carefully curated highlights, and while there's plenty here for foodies to marvel over, there's not a sophisticated portrait of Flynn and his internal drive.",

            "It's somewhat difficult in 2018 to find rooting interest in the story of a straight white male born into a wealthy household who manages to achieve his dream at an early age.",
            "Some salty talk in easygoing docu about talented young chef. ",
            "Such family dynamics makes director Cameron Yates' film something of a failure as a conventional food documentary. But it's that very tension that makes the material work as nonfiction drama.",
            "What sets this lively, engaging doc apart is that we see Flynn become a culinary star through the eyes of his mother.",
            "... acknowledges its subject's talent while keeping the material honest rather than hagiographic.",
            "At times, Cameron Yates appears to be too protective of his subjects, which somewhat neuters the drama of the narrative. ",

            "The result is a doc that probably made the McGarry family very happy, while proving frustrating to anyone who understands how documentaries are made and how restaurants work.",
            "Chef Flynn is a remarkable story of Flynn McGarry. I don't know that I would want my child to follow in Flynn's footsteps and experience his experiences. But at the end, you can't help but admire the man McGarry becomes."

            " Winogrand's verite style is jaw-dropping. So is his perceptiveness in chronicling an America undergoing a social metamorphosis in the 1960s. His mixture of blacks and whites in black and white are stark, haunting and revealing.",
            "A sumptuous collection of Garry Winogrand's iconic photos do the storytelling.",
            "Garry Winogrand: All Things Are Photographable is an elegant, tender ode to Winogrand, but it's no hagiography.",

            "While you'll salute Golden Exits for never going full-on Fatal Attraction, it ends up feeling cagey, trapped in the realm of the theoretical and too hip to raise its tensions above a simmer.",
            "The movie seems to be slowly pushing a needle into the lives that it scrutinizes, as if to draw a blood sample and learn what ails the characters.",
            "These narcissists declaim their insecurities and grievances in the language of personal essays. What they're saying may be petty and small, but the rhetoric and imagery are transfixing.",
            "Think early Whit Stillman without the archness, or Woody Allen without the schtick, self-seriousness or need for post-screening steel-wool shower, and you're almost there.",
            "A modest, introspective, and quietly poetic exploration of familial ennui.",
            "Emotionally parched, Golden Exits is a film of misconceptions based upon choices, behaviors, and romantic frustrations.",
            "Unfortunately, the women in Golden Exits don't have much to do other than brood, stew, and complain about the men in their lives.",
            "The last shot of Golden Exits... seems to suggest that walking to the golden vanishing point is, although unrealizable in metaphorical terms, as therapeutic as an act in itself. [Full review in Spanish]",

            "[A] decidedly unmelodious yet resoundingly affectionate Brooklyn saga.",
            "Golden Exits is a post love, post-passion and pro anti-depressant film. It is expressing its own curiosity at what it feels to be the inevitable conclusion of youth and living like there's no tomorrow.",

            "I may be an old curmudgeon, but one with a better outlook on life and people than the characters in Alex Ross Perry's latest film.",
            "Don't let the indulgent chatter fool you. Here, Perry has nothing to say that's worth listening to.",
            "...boasts a terrific ensemble demonstrating the unhappiness and self doubt revealed when their routines are nudged off tilt by one lone outsider.",
            "But to what end? Bergman, Cassavetes, and Allen excavated this material decades ago, and there are no new insights uncovered amid the interior lives of these husbands and wives.",
            "The steadfast refusal to follow through on the premise condemns the film to a state of dramatic constipation.",
            "I saw only performers who, with one conspicuous exception, were working hard to ignite a glum drama that declined to combust.",

            "Mr. Perry is such a good filmmaker that he can make the embarrassing and the unbearable insistently, fascinatingly engrossing (and often funny)."

            "Senso is lush, broadly emotional and beautifully photographed.",
            "Senso is an elegant, expensively-produced, period love story, set back in the Italian 1860s, and a stylist delight.",
            "Like other Visconti melodramas, [Senso is] sumptuous in its Technicolor expressionism.",
            "It is an obvious, rudimentary operatic approach to amour and an illustration of history that is likely to be fuzzy to anyone but a student of Garibaldi's 1866 campaign in and around Venice and Verona.",

            "Every minute of this film is absolutely mesmerizing.",
            "Superbly acted and confidently shot, \"Who We Are Now\" delivers substantial dramatic pleasures while posing pertinent questions.",
            "Once again, [Newton] refuses to pretend that lives in disarray can be magically repaired by good intentions, while simultaneously avoiding the defeatist attitude that insists there's consequently no point in even trying.",
            "While Nicholson's onscreen, it's impossible to pay heed to anything but her. She scorches the film with her barely bottled ferocity and vulnerability.",
            "Who We Are Now just ticks too many cliched boxes, particularly in the dialogue department.",
            "Who We Are Now is a poignant, touching, perfectly acted work that makes me immediately eager to see what Newton does next. Seek this one out.",
            "What a treat it is to see a character actor find a great a lead role and dive into it.",
            "Most Hollywood movies spoon-feed the viewer with easily digestible details of character and plot. This bracing indie movie insists we sit up and pay attention.",
            "\"Who We Are Now\" remains electric as the director once again brings the abstract into laser-like focus and creates a dramatically satisfying narrative out of issues involving class, family and gender without ever reducing their complexity.",
            "There is nothing fanciful or odd in Newton's story. The self-acceptance and courage of the two main characters make them admirable women.",
            "The power of Newton's film comes from the way he digs into Beth's vulnerability, depicting her inability to help herself. ",
            "Julianne Nicholson is so compelling as an ex-convict juggling her need for a job that pays enough for her to reclaim her small son that we in the audience can see her nomination possibilities as the awards season approaches.",
            "Warm, wise and thoroughly engrossing. Julianne Nicholson gives a mesmerizing, powerful performance. If there were any justice, she would be nominated for Best Actress this awards season. ",
            "Sometimes feels unfocused, and perhaps too ambitious, yet amid the slightly manipulative structure are some intriguing character dynamics and moments of powerful authenticity.",
            "Fused together by Nicholson's can't-look-away performance, Who We Are Know transcends any directorial quirks. ",
            "Newton carved out a raw and unsentimental journey for his protagonists that neither completely absolves them of their mistakes, nor robs them of the agency to make them. ",
            "Richly written and sensitively acted, and if some of the big monologues are a touch theatrical, well, these actors really move the merchandise, so that doesn't much matter.",
            "Who We Are Now benefits from the inclusion of several undeniably powerful sequences...",
            "Told with the full texture of real life, Nicholson's second collaboration with \"From Nowhere\" filmmaker Matthew Newton is a close-up character study that explores notions of forgiveness and self-worth with surgical precision.",
            "Newton has made a beautiful little film about sacrifice and redemption, and he earns it one tiny brushstroke at a time.",
            "Newton's storytelling is skittish and a bit too on the nose at times, but his palpable generosity toward his cast is rewarded with committed, passionate turns from the ensemble."

            "an effective emotional rollercoaster that explores the dark side of human nature, and its concise, pessimistic view of the American Dream is still admired today.",

            "Unfortunately it drops off badly, descending into tedium well before the end is reached, but some of the imagery is hard to forget."

            "Like its characters, Duck Butter is imperfect, but unlike human objects of our affection, it's attractive despite its flaws rather than because of them.",
            "The film starts to get more interesting as the cracks begin to appear.",
            "While some might be expecting shock, the unique Duck Butter ends up being honest and relatable, stripping bare the excess of what we often fear about ourselves and those we are with.",

            "Berman's film is beautifully photographed and whilst it has no great revelations or big payoffs, it's an intriguing slice of small town alternative American life, dressed up in Alien and government conspiracy tales...",
            "The film uses synthesizer music, odd camera angles, and foggy lens effects to create a sense of mystery, but there are also times in which Berman seems to be inviting viewers to gawk at the interviewees.",

            "Notes on an Appearance relays a narrative teeming with incident - death, disappearance - through an elusive yet methodical style.",
            "Outwardly the film comes off as a fussy exercise, holding emotion as well as spectacle at bay. Within the academic approach, however, is a desire for purity which has its apocalyptic side.",
            "This tale of a young man who goes missing in Brooklyn has some intriguing moments and a unique visual style, but it proves far too elliptical to be of much more than academic interest.",
            "By emphasizing the banality of everyday life, even when events are extreme, D'Ambrose achieves the paradoxical feat of making an hour-long film .. both slow and action-packed.",

            "D'Ambrose is clearly a filmmaker to watch, whose ideas and musings, much like Bresson's, are inexorably tied to film form in such a way that finds emotional truth through stylistic distance",
            "We're in deep, art house territory, but not without a sense of humor.",

            "\"Notes on an Appearance\" feels constructed like a maze with no exit.",
            "Zero-budget experimental minimalist thriller.",
            "A small, curiously enticing movie with the aspect of a game about it, a deceptively simple looking game with only a few moving pieces, though you'll have to muddle through without the instruction book",
            "This is a feature debut that proceeds with a forthright intelligence, moving in the exact thrilling and wonderfully bewildering manner that D'Ambrose wishes.",
            "With an apparent budgetary austerity, [director Ricky] D'Ambrose squeezes every ounce of everything he has to generate a complex story, well assembled and with disturbing visual power. [Full review in Spanish]"

            "Kore-eda marshals his considerable talents to tell what initially appears to be another story of family love and perseverance in the margins of society.",
            "This kind of subtle richness is not new for Kore-Eda, though it's as satisfying here as it's ever been.",
            "Kore-eda is at his best when he's suppressing his sentimentality, not when he's indulging it, but like his characters, fans of this inspired filmmaker must learn to take the good with the bad.",
            "It's all beautifully done, if seemingly aimless; for most of its two-hour runtime, the joy of the movie lies mostly in watching these fine actors build their beautifully flawed and lived-in characters.",
            "Director/writer Hirokazu Kore-eda handles the film with a pragmatic yet empathetic eye and as a result, crafts together one of the year's best movies that clutches the heartstrings by the time the credits roll.",
            "For the underprivileged, the concept of family can be as extended as necessity mandates [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Shoplifters tells a story about love, family, crime, and truth. It's life itself without the morality cloak. One of the best movies of 2018. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Shoplifters shows us that family is simply a concept, a social construct that has little to do with genetics and instead springs from love and sacrifice.",
            "Kore-eda offers an intimate view of a poverty-stricken Japanese family from ground level, where the ground is continually cut from underneath their feet. ",
            "This is a harrowing, elegant, and graceful piece of art that is easily one of the best offerings of the year.",
            "The film supposes another master work in the filmography of the Japanese director, full of periodic emotions and dramatic moments of great intensity of which I leave moved to the guts when I witness a family. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "[SHOPLIFTERS] is top-notch Kore-eda with a Farhadi-esque moral dilemma and fantastic, nuanced filmmaking that never spoon-feeds the audience and presents its story in graceful, absorbing ways.",
            "While this has the potential of becoming a bleak melodrama, Kore-eda ensures the story retains a sense of poignancy and emotionality. ",
            "With Shoplifters, Koreeda embarks on an ambitious philosophical journey to explore the fundamentals of family. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "\"Shoplifters\" is a genuine Koreeda film, a masterful family drama, and of his best latest works, which definitely says something considering the quality of all of his films. ",
            "It's accessible, fluently told and packs an unexpected punch.",
            "Filled with a compassionate, profound and intelligent narrative that never leaves you for a second, Shoplifters is the best film of the year and a perfect swan song to Kirin Kiki who literally gets buried in a Kore-eda household.",
            "Despite the hiding, the brokenness, and the stealing, this family in Shoplifters is a small snapshot of joy, and one that shines a sorely needed light.",
            "This film is perhaps the most unusual heartwarming movie we've seen and it's magical in its own way.",
            "Kore-eda is less interested in judging this family for their thievery ... than he is in examining their humanity and empathizing with their working-class plight.",
            "It's funny and emotional, uplifting and heartbreaking, it's one of the best movies of the year.",
            "There's a musicality to absolutely everything in the film, from petty thieving at corner stores to conversations around a crowded dinner table. "

            "12 Strong is a thinking-person's war story, one in which deductive and clever reasoning wins the day as often as who has the most bullets and air support. This is something quite different couched in a familiar cloak, and the results are impressive.",
            "From its hokey moments of \"character building\" to its sharply shot, but distinctly un-cinematic action sequences, 12 Strong feels very much like one long video game cut-scene.",

            "The story is compelling, and the movie overall was entertaining to watch, but to me, it wasn't as memorable as previous war films...",
            "While 12 Strong is based on true events, it never feels real due to how they cut corners when developing the film. What should be an interesting and unique story is instead a long slog through dull set pieces and canned dialogue...",

            "The film is all about clever writing, top-notch execution, and hard-hitting social commentary - but it is also a triumph of casting, and an ode to actors.",
            "As the chain of events unfold, the wit is very nicely interspersed with hard-hitting moments of greed and deceit providing a shock-and-awe effect that leaves you wondering how vulnerable can a common man be.",
            "You have to hand it to director Raghavan for not giving us perfectly sealed endings. He never wraps things up neatly and allows or expects the viewers to do the crazy math.",
            "Watch Andhadhun for it's zig zag storyline and spot on acting by the entire cast. It's one of those mysteries which you'll like to go back to despite knowing the ending.",
            "There's murder, betrayal, sex and a mountain of lies. In short, you can't look away. But as it happens too often in Hindi cinema, the energy takes a beating post-interval. ",
            "All the darkness comes laced with humour. Raghavan takes you to the edge of the seat with the pulse racing, makes you keep guessing even as you are chuckling.",
            "With a trimmer running length, the movie would have been perfect. Even at its current run-time of 139 minutes, Andhadhun slides into place as smoothly as one of Akash's piano pieces.",
            "This is the film we deserve.",
            "It all counts...every minute, second and millisecond of the unpredictable, crazy ride that follows.",
            "It's Tabu who runs away with the show. Raghavan's greatest misdirection was to make us believe that this film was about anything or anyone else.",
            "This phenomenal new thriller from Sriram Raghavan pulls off its tricks in plain sight. Everybody knows how a mystery should work, but Raghavan knows how all the mysteries work.",
            "Watch Andhadhun with your ears, eyes and minds open. You will come away with your senses heightened.",
            "Tabu is marvelous, Sriram Raghavan finally having created a fitting role for this uber-talented actress, whom we really should be seeing much more of.",
            "Open to various interpretations and unpredictable from beginning to end, AndhaDhun is an engaging thriller that keeps you on your toes and leaves you guessing all the way.",
            "Bollywood doesn't make too many thrillers and when it does, they don't always measure up. Andhadhun ticks all the right boxes. This one should be savoured."

            "A fluid dynamic that ensures this narrative of endurance is never difficult for the viewer to endure, while also drip-feeding information about the couple and their individual histories in just the right order to keep us both engaged and distracted.",
            "I didn't expect much going in Adrift. Maybe an escapist thriller with a decent lead performance. I ended up getting a lot out of it.",
            "Woodley is an absolute blast to watch in the film's most adventurous scenes.",
            "The longer we're at sea, we the audience begin to drift, craving the danger of \"Open Water\" or the imagination of \"Life of Pi.\" ",
            "A one-woman crewed voyage of grit and determination, one that frequently gets lost in its convoluted storyline.",
            "There are two stories playing out almost simultaneously -- each independently intriguing, but seemingly completely separate from each other.",
            "Director Baltasar Korm\u00e1kur . . . exacerbates manners by approaching the film with the same pace throughout, making sequences indiscernible from each other in rhythm and beats.",
            "If you're feeling adventurous and looking for another kind of superhero in a crowded field, this might be for you.",
            "A movie with the structure of Adrift has to live and die by the quality/believability of both its action and setting, and right off the bat it's clear that both will be handled well. ",
            "A film just as much about the freewheeling Kerouac-ian liberation of travel as a romance. The predictable plot machinations are hardly a detriment. ",
            "Adrift is a solid, midrange picture of the type that is increasingly rare. It's star-driven, suspenseful, and just plain gorgeous to look at. ",
            "Unfortunately, the film's survival aspect is not as compelling as other films of the same nature.",
            "The production could have fallen into the trap of being another run-of-the-mill feature about a love story... But, Icelandic director Baltasar Korm\u00e1kur shook things up a bit with more of an indie art-house style.",
            "[Shailene Woodley] gives an intrepid performance in a physically demanding role that places her onscreen the entire 1 hour and 36-minute runtime.",
            "If it's not quite as exciting as watching Blake Lively square off against a particularly pesky shark in The Shallows from two summers ago, there's still enough of interest to keep the new nautical drama Adrift afloat.",
            "It is solved in a tricky and incoherent way. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "Compelling and life-affirming, Adrift is a real-life survival story...Emotional and draining it will make you wonder what you have been doing with your life.",
            "In the efficient opening scene of Adrift's true story, a young woman, her face bloodied, awakens from unconsciousness to find herself alone on a partly submerged yacht with no land in sight.",
            "A stirring tale, well told with two lead performances that carry the audience through the narrative ebbs and flows. Woodley, as always, is the MVP."

            "Aardman has always done this layering of humour, so that adults can enjoy their stories as much as children, but this one pushes the volume up to 11. The glee runneth over from the first shot.",
            "The story is thin, allowing little room for imaginative engagement, and the comedy uninspired. Early Man contains a nice anti-sexism message, but delivers it half-heartedly.",
            "Early Man is not so much a return to form as it is a long overdue comeback -- and a welcome one at that.",
            "Aardman is a haven for creatures that hail from other species but match us or even outstrip us in proficiency and grace. Early Man, though, is stuffed with men and women...whereas the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air are reduced to extras.",
            "At least there's director Nick Park's playful Silly Putty visual imagination to take your mind off just how thin the story is.",
            "Mostly, \"Early Man\" plays like an overstuffed episode of \"The Flintstones,\" riffing on caveman accessories, as well as soccer fandom and hooliganism.",
            "An adventure that holds little in the way of surprises but is still a fun, sweet and enjoyable ride through Aardman's prehistoric valley.",
            "Light-hearted humour frequently falls on deaf ears giving an air of a rush job to get this completed, Bland runs through its defence and lands a spectacular free kick.",
            "With characters that are unappealing both emotionally and visually, this 89-minute movie -- which is only 79 minutes excluding credits -- turns out to be [Aardman's] own Cars 2.",
            "Early Man is loads of fun, plain and simple, geared toward a younger audience but still completely accessible to parents and other older folks.",
            "Early Man is guaranteed fun for all the family and a big welcome back to stop-motion animation at its finest.",
            "A fantastic and friendly comedy with soccer as a central element. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "It is charming, it has an adorable simplicity, a magnetism that is hard to describe, and it's superior to practically all the current animated cinema. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "It's refreshingly tactile, but ultimately comes up short when compared to the usually high Aardman standard.",
            "A fine movie for kids that will bore older audiences who are looking for something that has depth.",
            "Aardman takes us to the plasticine Pleistocene age with this joyous stop-motion animation.",
            "Serves as a reminder that Aardman is always out there creating worlds just as distinctive in their tone and overall aesthetic as anything Disney or Pixar were producing in their '50s or '90s heydays.",
            "A successful and welcome return to directing for the inimitable Nick Park...Despite failing to match the originality of his previous work, Early Man nonetheless shines on its own, bizarre, terms.",
            "I just didn't think it was funny and I didn't think that it was engaging as a sports movie.",
            "It's got that wonderful stop-motion look, a dynamite voice cast and the signature cheekily innocent wit that has become a hallmark of [Nick] Park's work.",
            "These characters are so adorably goofy and charming that you'll want to reach into the screen just so you can pinch their pudgy little cheeks. ",
            "The film finds its largest success in its beautifully British disposition and its singular animation style. ",
            "Amiable fun, though it's a slight story. The football references were easily understandable even to me, though they were, of course, only the ones I understood. Who knows how many went over my head, like a misjudged shot at goal.",
            "Apart from some song choices, it's is about as charmingly old-school as a Western animated feature has been in a long time."
