            "\"Star Wars\" is not \"Breaking Bad,\" and the same narrative tricks that worked for the latter feel jarringly out of place in the former.",
            "Star Wars: The Last Jedi may not be perfect, but the need to accept imperfection and keep going becomes one of the movie's themes...It's about mentorship that's invigorating rather than smothering.",
            "What's most interesting to me about The Last Jedi is Luke's return as the mentor rather than the student, grappling with his failure in this new role, and later aspiring to be the wise and patient teacher.",
            "With Johnson at the helm, the torch-along with the lightsaber-is safely passed to a new generation.",
            "A film that will make you want to watch it again and again and again. ",
            "The Star Wars universe is vast with so many potential stories to tell. The Last Jedi met my expectations because it was an attempt for the franchise to do something different that most blockbuster films struggle with.",
            "In terms of directing, The Last Jedi shines. In terms of storytelling, it meshes together a lot of elements that have so much potential, but that potential is left untapped.",
            "Rian Johnson has given us a breathtaking visual spectacle to go along with his plot, one which respects the viewer's intelligence and doesn't just hand-feed you. It's not just the characters that get a dose of expansion, but the saga as a whole.",
            "The Last Jedi attempts to use the past merely as a stepping-stone to build its own identity.",
            "In Which the Force, Having Awakened, Gets Some Badly Needed Coffee",

            " The Last Jedi isn't perfect but is easily everything a Star Wars fan could want that expands the SW universe into bold new realms while deftly invoking the films we love and remember from a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.",
            "Writer-director Rian Johnson has done a remarkable job making The Last Jedi a film that somehow both stands on its own and fits wonderfully into an ongoing journey.",
            "This felt much more like a kid's movie to me.",
            "This felt like paint by numbers.",
            "...fueled by joy, curiosity, awe, and even a little sadness. God, I love this movie.",
            "Go see it on the biggest screen possible and let the little kid in you enjoy every moment of it. ",
            "Overall, this is a profoundly satisfying episode without apparent weak spots (it's a notch disjointed, but nothing unbearable): You'll laugh, cry and be in awe...",
            "It is the most visually stunning of the eight Star Wars films, the characters speak with the elegance and wit... and the acting is often outstanding. It is exciting, funny, cute, tense, melancholy, smart, goofy, unexpected, and occasionally profound.",
            "The structure, at times, is similar to 30-minute episodes of a miniseries event that we're binge watching. And while some of the visual effects and cinematography are stunning, something is lacking overall. ",
            "Johnson unleashed one of the most spectacular visual feats within the Star Wars universe.",
            "Its heart is in the right place, more so than any of the other sequel films, but the conviction is lacking."

            "It Comes at Night is a powerful, slow-burning horror, a distressing and nihilistic examination of human nature that lingers in the mind long after the shocking denouement.",
            "The movie has its flaws. But one of Shults's main triumphs is to get us to believe in the danger of the outside world as fiercely as his characters do.",
            "Shults's adoption of a more vicious mode sharpens his already discomfiting take on families in states of extreme duress in his debut feature Krisha.",
            "It's a simple exercise in terror that avoids too much explicit violence, and a quietly impressive little movie.",
            "The characters' behaviour rings true, the tension is strong and the oily darkness of it all looks good.",
            "The \"It\" of the title refers to the contagious disease that has devastated the outside world (a world that, like much in this beautifully minimalist film, we never see), but it also denotes something even more virulent and destructive: human fear.",
            "This isn't to say that It Comes At Night is a bad film, but it is a disappointing one.",
            "Ends in such a way that will satisfy some and devastatingly disappoint others. ",
            "An unrelenting apocalyptic mood piece about how people cope with the end of the world.",
            "Deep and complex, filled with subtext and commentary on today's Fear Thy Neighbor mentality ... one of the most frightening films to come along in a while.",
            "Shults has taken a very personal story of loss from his own life and turned it into a source of suspense and fear that feels natural and honest, making it into the smartest and scariest horror film of the year. ",
            "It Comes at Night couldn't be less interested in playing into [horror] tropes... instead choosing to use our knowledge and expectations of the form to keep us asking the right questions while wondering if we even want the answers.",
            "The performances are excellent across the board, with one truly impressive standout. As the 17-year-old Travis, Kelvin Harrison Jr. is the audience identification character.",
            "Like many of the current crop of art horror films, director Trey Edward Shults's film has a strong social subtext. Like most zombie movies, it's about what happens when society fails and it's every man and woman for themselves.",
            "It Comes At Night is a riveting, emotional affair whose frustrating nature mirrors the frustrations of the human condition.",
            "A perfectly crafted thriller that uses an extreme circumstance to enclose us in a very humane conflict. [Full review in Spanish].",
            "Like an art-house M. Night Shyamalan, Shults commands sterling production value and a stellar sense of mise-en-scene, but more aggressive auds won't find much to sharpen their teeth on with this allegorical wisp masquerading as nightmare fuel.",
            "Horrifically mesmerizing with one hell of an effective score, the main flaw It Comes at Night seems to have is that its 90-minute duration goes by entirely too quickly.",
            "As a night drama cracked by tension and deception, the movie, directed by Trey Edward Shults, works. [Full review in Spanish] ",
            "... if you're looking for a suspenseful tale of a family in death defying dire straights, then give It Comes In The Night a shot.",
            "This is a morality play at its finest. There are no heros and no villains. There are simply humans in a house.",
            "It Comes at Night celebrates paranoia while making our collective extinction seem quietly inevitable. ",
            "The film never offers easy answers; perhaps we're only seeking a few moments of pleasure, because nobody gets out alive. ",
            "In the dark corners of Shults' bleak vision, we have nowhere to hide when the monster is actually us."

            "The film is not unsuccessful, as it's mostly entertaining enough, and if the gender politics seem oversimplified, there are reminders of some real-life commentaries.",
            "A light, funny, blissfully entertaining flick about heavy, sadly still relevant themes.",
            "This dramatisation revisits those carnivalesque events in splendidly springy fashion, achieving the quadruple grand slam feat of being emotionally engaging, politically intriguing, dramatically gripping and frequently very funny.",

            "A crowd-pleaser thanks to the dynamic performances by Emma Stone and Steve Carell...",
            "[I]t never replicates the agency or daringness of its protagonist, refusing its multiple opportunities for more effective drama or satire regarding institutionalized misogyny.",
            "A shame that it doesn't really get to grips with the motivations of the characters or gives enough context about the feminist movement of the time. Ultimately; great performances, shame about the script. Worth it for Andrea Riseborough alone.",
            "Although Battle of the Sexes takes place in 1973, its themes feel unfortunately modern.",
            "Battle of the Sexes is a glorious live-action cartoon of a movie that should score both at the box office and awards season.",
            "Unspooled in a straight-forward biography style by Dayton and Faris, Battle of the Sexes is an easy watch that provides a smattering of insight and a transportive amount of love for the decade.",

            "I found this movie to be completely blah.",
            "For a story that's just as depressingly relevant in 2017*** as it was in 1973, this film should be a lot more than simply pleasant.",
            "The film is effortless in its mainstream appeal however as it tackles a worthy subject without beating it over the head of its audience.",
            "Adding balance are the finely nuanced performances of both Emma Stone as King and Steve Carell as Riggs.",
            "Battle of the Sexes is a well crafted film that feels timely, fun, and occasionally even poignant",
            "Overall, Battle of the Sexes effectively addresses the issue of equality and with such as a strong lead performance from [Emma] Stone, it is hard to ignore.",
            "It captures time and place, offers a diverting two hours, and asks us to consider how much or little things have changed for women in our own time.",
            "It is an entertaining and illuminating film that shines a light on the emergence of the feminist movement and changes in attitude towards sexuality.",
            "With an impressive, extensive cast list, Battle of the Sexes is a timely story of the fight for gender equality.",

            "Kong: Skull Island is just good enough-the sharp allusions, the moments of wit and warmth supplied by Reilly's long-abandoned airman-to make one wish it were better.",
            "I've got no quarrel with a good, goofy monster movie - I'm the guy who liked 'The Great Wall.' But that film at least felt bound by a singular vision, by a director and his personality. 'Kong: Skull Island' is spare parts, held together with Scotch tape.",
            "Rebooted to coincide with the shared monsters universe set by Godzilla back in 2014, Kong: Skull Island certainly delivers on the excitement but is let down by other factors.",
            "Kong: Skull Island is a magnificent and impressive giant monster epic, that also feels very small and personal at the same time.",
            "If you want to see King Kong kick ass, this movie is for you. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Individual moments are incredibly fun and exhilarating, and the giant monsters are precisely as giant and monstrous as you can hope. But too many others are tedious and painfully dull. ",

            "This movie is a mess in so many ways.",
            "More Asian monster movie than American giant-animal attack film, this movie is rich and unfiltered entertainment.",
            "This is a movie which is all about fun and spectacle. And it delivers. What more could you want?",
            "Tom Hiddleston is supremely confident, and Brie Larson wants to take an unforgettable picture. Everybody is fine.",
            "Loud, violent, and just ridiculous enough to warrant a return to Skull Island as soon as the credits finish rolling, ladies and gentlemen, for your utter delight and pleasure, Vogt-Roberts presents: Kong: Skull Island.",
            "Kong: Skull Island is a ton of fun...however, I don't think upgrading to 3D is necessary-I saw it in 2D and was still blown away.",
            "A lot of stuff happens on Skull Island, but none of it makes much sense, so there's no emotional movement. ",
            "Podcast review",
            "As for the movie itself, it's a pretty mess, full of clich\u00e9d, overly explanatory, blockbustery action dialogue.",
            "Overall, Kong: Skull Island is a worthy popcorn flick where you can easily cheer for both human and creature.",
            "No one's taking any real risks with Kong: Skull Island except to promise the return of more monster mash-ups.",
            "It's well directed by Vogt-Roberts, well scripted and shot.",
            "Setting the benchmark for 2017's blockbusters, Kong: Skull Island is visually stunning, thrilling from start to finish and a triumphant big screen return for King Kong. Be sure to stay after the credits! "

            "Before I Fall examines what it means to ultimately be a good person and the effects of bullying in a time-loop story that has a bit more depth than the average young adult adaptation. ",
            "We care about these people, even though they be of rather ostentatious privilege, and are fully involved in their struggle to improve.",
            "There's much to ponder in the premise, but films rise and fall on the rapport we have with either the characters or the performers, and with \"Before I Fall,\" try as I might, I never fell under the sway of Samantha or Deutch.",

            "Rex is war lite, but as a film about trust, it hits the mark, staying just the right side of schmaltz.",
            "An uplifting story about companionship, devotion, and the lifelong friendship that develops from a mutual respect between a human and her animal.",
            "This is a stirring portrait of both war heroes.",
            "Genuinely heartwarming biopic despite its shortcoming of cliches. ",
            "It delves deeply and beautifully into the unbreakable bond between a soldier and her dog. Real life can sometimes be like a movie, and this is a prime example of that.",
            "The bottom line is that Megan Leavey is a riveting, inspiring and heart wrenching story, a fitting tribute to our female and four-legged military superheroes.",
            "It's a formulaic tale, but one for the shelf of contemporary films that are tracking our changing relationship to combat veterans, both human and canine.",
            "Often captivating largely in part due to a fantastic performance from Kate Mara; she is able to portray everything from a drifting loner personality to PTSD after an intense battle situation",
            "If your eyes aren't watering by the final frame, you're watching the wrong film or you simply don't have a heart.",

            "It all looks magnifique, thanks to [C\u00e9dric] Klapisch's stylish \u00e9lan and Alexis Kavyrchine's sun-dappled cinematography, which just revels in the Burgundy landscape. ",

            "Satisfying, eye-pleasing French drama about three thirty-something siblings forced by circumstance to reunite on the family's wine-producing homestead to decide its fate."

            "War for the Planet of the Apes is a great film, and it's the end of one of the best science fiction trilogies made in years.",

            "This is the third sequel all franchises should aim to have in their filmography. War for the Planet of the Apes is one of the most sincere and one of the most human films to experience from 2017. Andy Serkis is a monkey god among men.",

            "Both writer and director set out in search of a heroine. They're so intent on crafting a legend, they leave out the uncomfortable bits. They do her and us a disservice in that respect.",
            "Maud's life was constricted, but her gaze was expansive. And so is her movie.",
            "Maudie is a sad film about poor people, but it could scarcely be more open to benevolence and quiet humanism.",
            "Walsh's film feels jarringly at odds with contemporary sensibilities. A bully is a bully, no matter how cheerfully he is painted.",
            "A difficult and highly mannered performance from Sally Hawkins coupled with a repugnant and profoundly unappealing character played by Ethan Hawke sink this curious, and curiously saccharine, biopic.",
            "[Maudie] fulfils all our narrative expectations and you'll almost certainly exit the cinema happy, so long as you can leave it there.",
            "A beautifully crafted bio-pic of the 20th-century Canadian folk artist Maud Lewis.",
            "Maudie is a remarkable and utterly unique film that I still can't believe someone actually made, but much like Maud's paintings, someone saw a quality in her story that they recognized as worthy of attention, admiration, and beauty.",
            "Oscillating between moments of pain and ones of inspiring artistic expression, Maudie captures the nuance of Maud Lewis's life and her unexpected success as an artist. ",
            "Hawkins and Hawke, both award-winning actors, turn in great performances, but is is Hawkins as Maude who will be hard to overlook at Oscar season this year.",
            "Sally Hawkins received a Best Actress Oscar nomination for \"The Shape of Water\", but she was better in \"Maudie\". ",
            "Every now and then you come across a performance so extraordinary that it transcends its film and becomes a force of nature all its own. Sally Hawkins' towering work in Aisling Walsh's Maudie is one such performance.",
            "Maudie is an inspiring, heart-warming true-story film that most audiences will find hard to resist.",
            "A terrific performance from Sally Hawkins carries this biopic about an artist that has physical limitations and her unique marriage.",
            "The film, if observed too closely, is not quite to scale here and slightly out of kilter there, but who cares? Art isn't science. It doesn't have answers. It doesn't have to have the answers. Not when it's beautiful.",
            "Hawke tries hard but never quite convinced me to buy him as Everett as much as Hawkins does as Maud. Still, the two leads do have a nice rapport that makes the relationship feel organic and honest.",
            "Hawkins grabs and holds the scenes, not with overdramatics, but with humour and delectable gestures. ",
            "Maudie is a riveting and brilliantly acted insight into what is to most of us the life of a little known to us folk artist, though beloved in Canada, who against all the odds triumphed over her surroundings. ",
            "Who would have known that behind the gentle, smiling face and diminutive frame lay years of pain and struggle? And yet, in spite of it all, she dipped her brushes in colourful paints and gave us nostalgic visions of bright-eyed innocence.",
            "The two lead actors, and the careful direction by Aisling Walsh are what make this film work. ",
            "An intimate portrait of a complex life, the film delivers rewards for its unusual circumstances, much like Maud Lewis herself.",
            "Hawke has more of a mountain to climb when it comes to being convincing as an ordinary Nova Scotia bod, but even he comes good by the end.",
            "As Maud, Sally Hawkins gives an outstanding physical performance matched by a quiet resolve and a somewhat mischievous sense of humour.",
            "Maudie ultimately just seems like a quaint exercise, more like visiting a history museum than watching a woman who truly lived."

            "Amityville: The Awakening has a good cast, and, if viewed by a group of rowdy friends late at night, may certainly do its due diligence in periodically startling you for 87 minutes",
            "Feels half baked and woefully under developed.",
            "Khalfoun tries to be a little bit clever with the effort, frosting the endeavor with self-awareness, but what he really needs are effective frights and less predictability in this, the latest chapter in a weirdly enduring franchise."

            "The only redemption is seeing Elton John as Poppy's piano-bashing, singing, F-word-dropping hostage, but even he becomes tiresome before too long. If there's a Kingsman 3, I'll defect to Statesmen. At least they have whisky.",
            "What a mess it is.",

            "The key to a strong punch is the force and willingness to follow through, but Birth of the Dragon is so limp that it crumples on impact.",
            "Alas, this inspired-by-fact tale does little to inspire or enlighten and only very occasionally enlivens. A squandered opportunity.",
            "Overall, while Birth of a Dragon showcases Ng and Yu's talents and great action scenes that are sure to win over martial arts fans, having a Caucasian drive a story about two Asian martial artists just feels like a cinematic cop-out.",

            "Birth of the Dragon seems like nothing so much as a missed opportunity. ",
            "Sadly, Birth of the Dragon does not shed any considerable revelations on the aura of Bruce Lee . There is simply no excuse for any full feature vehicle that aims to echo the magnetism of the boisterous Bruce Lee to come off as flat and flavorless",
            "So, our main character in the \"Bruce Lee Origin Movie\" (really!) is... some fictional guy named Steve.",
            "This cheaply produced and oddly unfocused drama is underwhelming in the extreme.",
            "Has enough energy and spark to hold the audience's interest. But the script's focus on a caucasian character throws the central story off balance. ",
            "Not only does Birth of the Dragon struggle to correctly handle its main character, Lee is also often positioned as a mere supporting character in an overplayed, overdone romance between McKee and Jingjing Qu's Xiulan.",
            "I sometimes felt more like I was watching the pilot episode of a 1980s TV show -- a cheap action-adventure series in which the cheerful kung-fu teacher Bruce Lee would come to the aid of someone pestered by bad guys.",
            "The film comes alive during the energetic fight sequences.",
            "The film's lively inventions pay off, however, when we reach the epic showdown and Lee's fists of fury come up against Wong's serene Shaolin artistry. Even if this isn't how things happened, it is certainly rousing on screen.",
            "What could have been a fascinating insight into street versus classical martial arts instead becomes a generic fight flick, with a script so heavy-handed it feels like it was bashed out with knuckle-dusters.",
            "In the end, I walked out of this movie thinking I paid full price for a made-for-TV movie.",
            "Birth of the Dragon is not a complete mess; but given its subject of choice it should have been nothing short of sensational.",
            "It isn't even about Bruce Lee, really.",
            "Philip Ng as Bruce Lee is well cast. The early swagger and the transformation later are portrayed quite well."

            "At least an Agneepath or a Brothers merited a takedown for bastardizing or 'dumbing down' famous films. I don't think OK Jaanu even tried enough to warrant that.",
            "The thing that works most in OK Jaanu's favour is its screenplay, kept intact from its Tamil predecessor. It is a scene-for-scene remake and capitalizes on great moments from the original film.",
            "It's disappointing to see a man of Mani Ratnam's calibre pen a story that loses its plot as it keeps presenting the same thing over and over again in slightly different settings.",
            "There is something to be said for a film that takes a tired romantic trope and turns it into a tale that will bring a smile to your face.",
            "Do yourself a favour and watch the Tamil version with subtitles, because the Hindi version is a pale imitation.",
            "Ali has all the elements in place for a breezy ode to young love, but his mechanical approach and miscasting ensure that OK Jaanu is not exactly an okay remake.",
            "AR Rahman's music and Gulzar's pen add to the charismatic, positive vibe of the movie -- while the music keeps it peppy and new-age, Gulzar's dialogues ensure that melodrama does not overpower the film."

            "I expected a dark period drama - but the film went way past that. This is no Jane Austen piece. Get ready for a truly psychological thriller.",

            "This is Neeson's hour in virtually every humor-less frame, which lends the material the requisite ambience it needs. At the same time, Felt himself now seems like a footnote of the era, which relegates the film to a certain peripheral undertaking.",

            "Some of the detail about Felt's private life feels like a distraction but this is mostly a solid, absorbing political drama.",
            "The story's accidental timeliness may generate some interest, but the film kills it pretty swiftly.",
            "Sadly the film's long-winded title is emblematic of a rather convoluted endeavour, albeit entertaining.",
            "A solidly absorbing drama held together by Neeson's stern, steely performance.",
            "Any effort to compare scandals past and present fly by in this wastefully curtailed re-enactment of an impactful historical moment.",

            "Until the final 15 minutes of its deceptively short hour-and-a-half running time, Hero is a marvel, one of the best films to be released in the United States this year. It concludes, however, on a note both emotionally unsatisfying and morally idiotic.",
            "As they move through the martial-arts sequences, the performers leave the impression that the laws of gravity are subject to amendment. The rules of love and war -- all's fair -- are, Hero makes clear, immutable.",
            "The result is not so much a historical epic as a kind of highly determined ballet: dreamy with bloodless violence, relying less on shades of character than on magnificence of gesture.",
            "The austerity of Hero makes you realize how cluttered other action movies are.",
            "The result is both thrilling and thoughtful, offering imaginative action sequences as it considers questions of loyalty and the individual's role in history.",
            "As a technical achievement, Hero finds Zhang at the height of his powers, effortlessly expanding into complex genre filmmaking without losing his command. But in light of his earlier work, the film continues a sharp decline in urgency.",
            "One of the best Chinese movies of all time. And one of the best wuxia films of all time. Simply gorgeous. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "It is entirely possible that this is the single most beautiful film of the 2000s.",
            "An acceptable adventure that features some breathtaking action sequences and exquisite cinematography. ",
            "If it were merely lovely and silly, that would be fine, but Hero wants to be more than merely kung fu fun. It has a message.",
            "What makes Hero special is that it has so much more going for it than just the superb fight sequences. There are a satisfyingly complex plot, passionate romance, cool special effects and strong performances.",
            "Sumptuous and breath-catching, Hero blends the elegance of fine visual art with the more familiar cinematic jollies of attractive people engaged in crunching punch-ups.",
            "Zhang Yimou's Hero is a true martial arts epic -- a spectacle of movement, color and sound that will leave you awe-struck.",
            "Intoxicatingly beautiful, structurally enigmatic and decidedly brief.",
            "Gorgeous martial arts movie for older kids.",
            "Zhang weaves a complex and interesting story but the ultimate strength of Hero is its poetic beauty.",
            "When we are not left agog by the pristine production design and costuming, we marvel at the various staged conflicts, each one bringing a new level of proficiency and polish to an already overripe genre.",
            "A visually stunning martial arts epic in the wuxia tradition.",
            "Without the clarity of story, we begin to lose connection with the martial action, and it starts to seem repetitive.",
            "This intriguing, intoxicating martial-arts epic about the unification of China during the third century B.C. is a visual masterpiece.",
            "... one of the best films of its kind and one of the most beautiful films ever made.",
            "In what may be the movie's most spectacular set piece ... Zhang pits the sword against the pen and fends off war with knowledge and non-violence.",
            "Better experienced than discussed -- and better seen two or more times."

            "Bening is extraordinary and ordinary, deftly balancing the complexities of Gloria's personality, and as with many Hollywood stars we aren't ever sure if they became legends despite or because of them.",
            "Thankfully, Bening and Bell seem to know more about their respective characters (and their unusual supportive bond) than those at the creative controls of this middling movie.",
            "While there could be more that goes into a Gloria Grahame film, as a May-December Hollywood weepie, Film Stars Die in Liverpool earns its Kleenex.",

            "Entirely fresh, as the hip JR creates monumental photo portraits of some of the hardworking citizens the collaborators meet while the elfin Varda (now 90) reconciles the memories of her vibrant past with the realities of failing eyesight and curling feet.",
            "Eye-opening and hilarious, this photographic road trip through France with Agnes Varda and artist JR delights in their partnership without shying away from the tensions. Varda's old friend Jean-Luc Godard looms large through his confusing absence.",
            "At once a youthful cine-collage and a road movie mapped out like origami folding out in all directions and then back in on itself in search of something new and old at once, Faces, Places is a masterwork of sublime simplicity.",

            "I just can't recommend you rush to the theater to see it. This movie feels like a practice run. Hopefully the next collaboration between Dillard and Blumhouse - a \"survival horror\" called Sweetheart - will be better.",
            "Sleight's payoff and take home messages are good enough to mostly forgive its glaring flaws.",
            "Sleight is a strong feature debut for Dillard with great moments that tend to pick up the more humdrum bulk of the film. It's definitely uneven, but the glorious, jaw-dropping climax is worth the price of admission alone.",
            "Director by J.D. Dillard brings this under-the-radar drama close to genre cliches but deftly avoids them with his strong characters, fine storytelling, and vivid atmosphere. ",
            "Overly familiar drug-dealer-wants-to-get-out plot saddled with a scientifically insupportable gimmick as its solution. ",
            " For a film at least partially about magic (and, \"science-magic\"), it lacks a decided bit of that necessary misdirection, and the proceedings are often predictable. Sleight is, well, slight.",
            "A street magician with a magnetic personality baffles spectators in a reasonably entertaining naturalistic drama.",
            "If Sleight wasn't so entertaining, one might be tempted to define it as a social drama in which we are witnesses to the lack of opportunities young black men are provided.",
            "A creative twist on the urban thriller.",
            "Too slow out of the starting gate and too thin with conflicts, struggling hard to find its position as either something incredible or something sincere.",
            "Dillard's feature debut squanders its high concept ... and serves up a low-rent, Nickelodeon-lite version of that story, blowing his chance with corny acting, paint-by-numbers plotting, and a dippy score."

            "While it is certainly ambitious, and undeniably beautiful, its style often feels divorced from its narrative, losing itself stargazing when the story required something more personal.",

            "I can understand where there is value in showing this film to younger children because the message, albeit sanitized, will resonate.",
            "It sometimes over-plays its hand but, anchored by a terrific Jacob Tremblay, Wonder is a warm persuasive argument for tolerance.",
            "It's a little mawkish, but Chbosky, a YA institution himself, has a gift for understanding young people and the nuances of their relationships.",
            "If in the end the film feels a little too tidy, a little too contrived in the way the plot elements are neatly sewn together, this is perhaps a small price to pay for a film with its heart firmly in the right place.",
            "Kudos to Stephen Chbosky for stepping back and allowing Julia Roberts to breathe life into the role of Isabel.",

            "It knows that kids are aware of the adult world -- or at least how they perceive it -- and how pop culture influences their conversations and actions.",
            "Sometimes you're simply powerless to resist being emotionally manipulated by truly good film about compassion.",
            "A conventional story at its core, but one heavy on heart all the same, Wonder utilises its assets and winds up being a far stronger film than one may be expecting",
            "You will shed a tear or two, as this inspirational story tugs at all the right heartstrings.",
            "This is a good holiday film for the family. ",
            "A faithful adaption of an excellent book delivered with a welcome gentle restraint.",

            "The fragmented narrative providing several points of view of the same event helps to approach different sensations. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "This could easily have been a cloying and sappy film, but it is a testament to Chbosky's skill as a director and screenwriter that it isn't.",
            "Wonder is one of those movies that's supposed to make you cry and feel good, but it lets you get there organically instead of being too heavy-handed.",
            "Charming and eye-opening to how difficult it is for adolescents who are different feel as they go throughout their lives.",
            "In the end, the film was just too vanilla with a plucky kid that was more self-absorbed than wonderful.",
            "While there are certainly clich\u00e9s on view, you just can't argue with such a feel-good movie and its mission to spread a little more kindness, tolerance and love.",
            "[Wonder] is a heartfelt and thoughtful movie, a fantastic parable for any kid who has struggled with what it means to be different. The performances are spot-on, the sentiments are sincere and the emotions generated are genuine.",

            "So while providing some enlightening insight into the 36th President (\"a sensitive man with an enormous ego,\" as this film's JFK puts it), LBJ never truly engrosses.",
            "This early-days biopic isn't quite as good as the Bryan Cranston film All the Way but, along with Tom Wilkinson's performance in Selma, it continues Hollywood's crusade of recasting LBJ's public image.",

            "...LBJ moves at a fast, highly entertaining clip...",
            "When the film isn't cracking jokes the film explores Johnson's desire to be liked by the public and fears of rejection but doesn't go far enough to ensure compelling results",

            "Woody Harrelson delivers a powerhouse performance in this straightforward, solid political drama.",

            "Though we may not all live in the same community as its characters, the sheer love, commitment, and vulnerability involved are human qualities we can identify with. Let the film shine its gentle light on you and allow you to blossom.",
            "For a film that focuses on parent-child relations in the wake of a tragic death, Menashe remarkably eschews sentimentality or lazy conjecture.",
            "An undeniably impressive work guided by an auteur-like Weinstein, Menashe is simultaneously entrancing and beguilingly underdeveloped.",
            "The scant 82 minute runtime manages to pack a shocking amount of heart.",
            "There are welcome insights in to a culture largely ignored by society; unfortunately, they are married in to a domestic drama that slowly loses steam and never manages to overcome how boringly familiar its central scenario is.",
            "Menashe has a tenderness to it that is hard to decry, and because it's shorter than your average film, it doesn't have the time to go off the rails and become something it's not.",
            "Weinstein walks a tightrope similar to the one of his main character, and though Menashe may occasionally falter, this director impressively does not in his first feature.",
            "This a touching film that depicts the father/son relationship in a manner that feels as authentic as its setting. ",
            "Writer/director Joshua Z Weinstein is a documentary maker and this is his first feature but it has a very verit\u00e9, naturalistic feel.",

            "Refreshingly, Sim\u00f3n's take on the \"summer that changed everything\" movie is delicate and unsentimental, earning an emotional response simply by exploring how a child interprets loss from the child's perspective and at the child's pace.",
            "...a wonderfully honest and gracefully directed insight into the world of children.",
            "Frida's gaze governs everything, taking you back to the mysteries, the insecurities - and the joys - of being six.",
            "Summer 1993 is, at its core, a sad, potentially tragic tale of emotional survival. It meanders. It ends almost randomly. But the truth of its emotions sticks in the mind.",
            "A deeply personal child's-eye view of loss, Summer 1993 is an utterly beguiling debut feature from Spanish writer-director Carla Sim\u00f3n.",
            "In its subtlety, richness and warmth it is entirely beguiling - complex and simple at the same time. It is also very moving.",
            "Throughout the film's 96 minutes, Sim\u00f3n approaches the material from a perspective that is entirely from Frida's perspective, but her viewpoint remains equally retrospective.",
            "Carefully put together and wonderfully acted, Summer 1993 is a beautiful film not only to reflect on the fearful period of 90s and the generation it affected but also highlights unconditional love of the tight-knit family overcoming tragedy.",
            "Its magic and sensibility are conquering spectators from all over the world. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "Whisked by night from her Barcelona home to a cosy country house, six-year-old Frida is a downcast observer of her unwanted new world. Her parents are dead and she must now find a new way forward with her uncle and his family.",
            "A naturally beautiful and uninhibited work, more a filmed photo album of precious memories than a story with a beginning, middle or end.",
            "Its depiction of Frida as being at the mercy of powerful emotions she cannot yet comprehend, and how childhood itself is often bittersweet, is universal and timeless.",
            "Summer 1993 is such a delicately crafted and deeply moving memoir it is astonishing that this film is Simon Pip\u00f3's debut. ",
            "Featuring fantastic performances from its cast, sensitive and illuminating direction from director Carla Simon and an assuredly humanistic look on the mindset of a child, Summer 1993 is one of 2018's best films.",
            "Rather, Summer 1993 is less family melodrama and more a love letter to childhood and to the parents who shape it.",
            "Here, we get a nuanced and heartbreaking picture of a child displaced to her Aunt and Uncle. However, the film needs to have more insights to sustain itself. ",
            "Summer 1993 is a quiet, tender character study focused on its young protagonist, her youthful existence in a state of flux following the death of her mother.",
            "Sim\u00f3n's loving replication of the past is anchored in a bevy of lush greens and warm tans, with the sounds of domestic and outdoor life coming through with a keen vitality.",
            "In one form or another, we can all relate to some childhood experience shared by the film's two young protagonists. An ingenious portrait of family, heartbreak, and belonging.",
            "The four actors did extended improvisations as a family before the film shoot began and the chemistry they developed shows; they have a convincing intimacy together.",
            "[Summer 1993] avoids simplification and develops its complexity from the internal labyrinth that Frida lives in. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "It is spellbinding and whimsical with a strong, beating heart and that is down to the central performances of the child actors...",
            " In the most generous of ways, Sim\u00f3n's sun-kissed drama respects a child's complex emotional experience without compromising its poetic simplicity.",
            "This is a slow, quiet film of gentle revelation. Come to see the debut feature of a promising filmmaker, armed with patience, a sense of discovery, and, if possible, your own inner child."

            "It's a film that just keeps getting stronger as it goes, unfolding almost imperceptibly and becoming deeper with each scene.",

            "Whatever pickle he gets himself in, we can't help but root for Menashe.",
            "It is small and specific, admittedly, but it also tells a universal story about a father's struggle to hold on to the son he loves, and it tells this story tenderly, thoughtfully, beautifully.",
            "Seeing single fatherhood examined in the context of another culture that exists alongside other more commonly conveyed American cultures is a unique experience film-goers are not often afforded.",
            "Menashe is an easygoing, heartfelt comedy held together by a thread of tenderness.",
            "Spoken entirely in Yiddish, Menashe is a sort of Kramer vs. Kramer of the Hasidic community in Borough Park, Brooklyn. Played by Menashe Lustig, the titular character proves immediately lovable, if not a mensch.",
            "Moving and occasionally rather heartbreaking.",
            "This sensibly directed, melancholic little film prizes sincerity instead of overblown melodrama.",
            "It is a sometimes emotional, eye-opening treatise showing the tough, gray area decisions religious people like Menashe have to deal with in today's world.",
            "Though we may not all live in the same community as its characters, the sheer love, commitment, and vulnerability involved are human qualities we can identify with. Let the film shine its gentle light on you and allow you to blossom.",
            "For a film that focuses on parent-child relations in the wake of a tragic death, Menashe remarkably eschews sentimentality or lazy conjecture.",
            "An undeniably impressive work guided by an auteur-like Weinstein, Menashe is simultaneously entrancing and beguilingly underdeveloped.",
            "The scant 82 minute runtime manages to pack a shocking amount of heart.",
            "There are welcome insights in to a culture largely ignored by society; unfortunately, they are married in to a domestic drama that slowly loses steam and never manages to overcome how boringly familiar its central scenario is.",
            "Menashe has a tenderness to it that is hard to decry, and because it's shorter than your average film, it doesn't have the time to go off the rails and become something it's not.",
            "Weinstein walks a tightrope similar to the one of his main character, and though Menashe may occasionally falter, this director impressively does not in his first feature.",
            "This a touching film that depicts the father/son relationship in a manner that feels as authentic as its setting. ",
            "Writer/director Joshua Z Weinstein is a documentary maker and this is his first feature but it has a very verit\u00e9, naturalistic feel.",
            "It's a touching and nuanced film, and so skillfully made that you quickly get over the novelty of the fact that its characters are speaking Yiddish and get right into the story.",
            "Weinstein's ability to notch up the dramatic side of the story without bringing manipulative tricks into play is praiseworthy. His work serves up a tart platter that gives you food for thought.",
            "An engaging family drama, performed entirely in Yiddish and set within Brooklyn's ultra-orthodox Jewish community of Borough Park."

            "What a bland and sugary texture there is to this very conservative, undemanding oldster roadtrip.",

            "For all its seeming modesty, this is a mature, contemplative and mostly rewarding experiment: no awards-season bruiser, but a worthwhile B-side for Ashby's venerable American classic.",
            "When I drove home from Last Flag Flying, I felt good. Great movies always put me in a good mood.",
            "Though Last Flag Flying lacks much of the subtlety of its source material, it remains an engaging and entertaining trip with a group of charming characters.",
            "One of Richard Linklater's greatest strengths, as both a writer and a director, is revealing deeper truths about his characters through their interactions with one another.",
            "Richard Linklater fans will appreciate the sense that this still-young master has recovered the wit and inventive style he possessed back in the 90s.",
            "Last Flag Flying isn't unwatchable, but mere hours after seeing it, I'd already stopping thinking about it, which is rare for me when it comes to Linklater's work.",
            "I didn't know what to expect from Last Flag Flying but it's a really great film that hopefully won't be lost in the all the big releases this fall.",
            "[Last Flag Flying] is laced with buddy friendship and humor as well as so much sadness. ",

            "Last Flag Flying will certainly stir memories of the 1973 Jack Nicholson vehicle The Last Detail, and that's no accident.",
            "It is an uneven film, that succeeds best when it focuses on the spiritual journey of its young protagonist. ",
            "The pacing and motivation is so off-kilter that we never connect to the players in the first place.",
            "Linklater's latest entry, Last Flag Flying, while not quite as strong, continues this tradition and is a beautiful depiction of male friendship in America.",
            "It's good fun and has a warm heart, but there's nothing of real substance on offer in Last Flag Flying. Cranston is still immensely watchable, however, in one of his best film roles to date.",
            "For most of its duration, Last Flag Flying felt more like a banal film rather than a Linklater's film.",
            "A touching riff on friendship, loss, and bonding through grief. It's incredibly sad, but it's also achingly beautiful. ",
            "LAST FLAG FLYING tackles what goes on the minds of not-so-happy veterans without serving the jingoistic conservatism that so many military films find themselves worshipping."

            "Human Flow is not an easy film to watch. It feels like an accusation, a condemnation. ",

            "Geoffrey Rush so excels at playing real-life figures... that one welcomes the very idea of him as sculptor and painter Alberto Giacometti.",
            "Stop me if you've heard this one before (no, seriously. stop me). A depraved creative genius is on a quest to find artistic value in living, treating everyone around 'him' like sh*t in the process.",
            "It's always interesting to ask artists how they know their work is finished. Whatever else goes on this \"Final Portrait,\" Tucci captures that struggle perfectly.",
            "But the magic of the film lies in [Stanley] Tucci's eye for a sense of place - Paris in the Sixties - and while the scenes in Giacometti's studio are all blacks and grays, there are shining moments of color that sparkle. ",
            "Working from his own screenplay, Stanley Tucci (best known as an actor) delivers a character study that's low on character development.",
            "This movie is, literally, about watching paint dry - but Tucci and the cast find a world of detail and nuance.",
            "Final Portrait leaves the viewer with the feeling that he or she might as well have caught it on TV. And for a movie about a great painter and sculptor, this is not a recommendation.",
            "Final Portrait is enlightening, amusing, thrilling and sometimes touching, with Rush and Hammer forming the perfect artistic odd couple.",
            "The public is able to discover the chaotic, complicated, strange and fascinating lifestyle of the artist. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "Final Portrait is a slow burn and slow study, slightly inaccessible to those uninitiated with Giacometti at first, but rewarding if stuck with as the characters take hold.",
            "Writer-director Stanley Tucci clearly had a vision and the skills necessary to tell this story, along with actors who are completely captivating as they give their all. But without something to say, the result is about as interesting as a blank canvas.",
            "Tucci's ideas, together with Rush's acting abilities, were enough to minimally shape the artist, but this biographical drama has no place among the best I've seen lately. ",
            "Under the watchful eye of director Stanley Tucci, Final Portrait is filled with an undercurrent of humor throughout -- crisply paced, allowing its two lead actors the chance to really sink into their respective roles.",
            "The actors are wonderful.",
            "The film is a complicated one, but the script is relatively sparse and meandering. As such, the pacing feels very slow.",
            "Subverts the tortured artist narrative just enough to remain urgent, mostly because the two leads continuously challenge each other. ",
            "A portrait of the poignant and strange mysteries of the creative process. ",
            "There is no doubt that Geoffrey Rush, winner of an Oscar for embodying another genius... is the perfect actor to give life to Giacometti. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Tucci steps up to the task and challenge fastidiously and with obvious fascination for its chosen topic.",
            "Final Portrait is quiet, patient, thoughtful and at times really funny, with a meditative quality that the engaging actors slip into effortlessly. ",
            "An intimate, actor-friendly film focused on the creative process, with a story ultimately resolved by performance and deception.",
            "Rush gives one of his best-ever performances, which is saying a lot.",
            "The Agony of Making Art",
            "Final Portrait may not plunge you into the miracle of artistic expression-go see an Andy Goldsworthy movie for that-but it offers a lively glimpse at the process from the outside looking in."

            "Not even Jackie Chan can save this ill-advised mash-up.",
            "Once in a while I see a film that is hypnotic in its awfulness; which means it's so bad that you can't look away. Kung Fu Yoga is one such film.",
            "Kung-Fu Yoga scratches fans' itch for no-nonsense, no-pretense Chan fare - in which he isn't second-banana to a Western star, or married to a director who thinks VFX are required to make Chan's stunts more impressive.",
            "A movie that combines kinetic stunts with exotic locations on a very grand scale.",
            "So miscalculated that it briefly made me forget why I love Jackie Chan films.",
            "[A] harmless romp ...",
            "Kung Fu Yoga is a massive disappointment for fans of Jackie Chan, fans of cinema, Indian fans, Indian people in general and is just a complete embarrassment for all involved.",
            "Kung-Fu Yoga works because of the numerous scenes of fantastic hand-to-hand combat that are often punctuated with a comedic tone. ",
            "... the film is a mess, split between a bunch of characters and jumping genres at every cut, with a juvenile humor clearly aimed at younger audiences.",
            "If you're going for the Kung Fu, chances are you'll end up in a meditative state instead.",
            "With a generous runtime of almost 2.5 hours, Kung-fu Yoga does outstay its welcome.",
            "... the mediocre storyline and routine fighting bored me after a while, but the beautiful cinematography saves it all.",
            "Gleefully helping itself to whatever seems fun at the time, Kung Fu Yoga captures the matinee spirit perfectly.",
            "The pace is snappy, the sets and colors are always eye-popping, and the whole thing has a good, fun spirit. ",
            "If you have grown up watching Jackie Chan movies and loved him more for his comic timing and endearing goofiness or his expert kung fu, Kung Fu Yoga will leave you with a feeling of sadness.",
            "The fast-paced plotting, and typically silly action-comedy sight gags ensure that the 103-minute running time breezes by, but there is little here that hasn't been seen before, or that Chan hasn't done better.",
            "The slapstick fight scenes and action set-pieces - particularly a car chase in Dubai punctuated by a languid lion's presence - elevate the film somewhat, but Kung Fu Yoga's broadness is not so much engaging as merely ticking the many boxes.",
            "By the time it all culminates in a Chan-led classic Bollywood production number, the cuteness factor may have been pushed to its limit, but good luck trying to stop that goofy smile from spreading across your face.",
            "Tong embraces garish, conspicuous kitsch.",
            "The globetrotting adventure yarn extensively, and energetically, riffs on Indiana Jones's signature moments. You'll wish that its storytelling polish matched its enthusiasm.",
            "A joyous Bollywood dance extravaganza aptly wraps up the proceedings. It might not be part of Chinese tradition, but it is celebratory.",
            "Chan remains an icon of cinema, and he's helped elevate Kung Fu Yoga above the run-of-the-mill. ",
            "An amiable, average-at-best caper-like quest remains just that, even with recognisable talent, and even more so when its combination of elements is clearly stretched."

            "It's a reminder that, even for world-famous icons, it's pointless to reduce people to a single piece of notoriety.",
            "Bombshell suffers from some common complaints of modern documentary -- too much music; unnecessary, if perfectly decent, animated sequences -- but it does remind us of a class of personality that doesn't exist anymore.",
            "Dean explores a fascinating life full of contradictions.",
            "Lamarr was an enigma: a great brain trapped in a silly, spurious image of glamour, while her real talent was allowed to wither. A sad but fascinating story.",
            "Another story of a smart woman whose talent was unrecognized sufficiently during her lifetime [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Athough a string of famous talking heads - from Mel Brooks to Diane Kruger - pop up here to celebrate Lamarr's remarkable achievements, the sense of wasted gifts gives director Alexandra Dean's film an underlying sadness.",
            "Bombshell suggests that Lamarr was largely wasted by the film industry, which could make little use of her personality and intellect. \"",
            "Director Alexandra Dean gets the most out of a peculiar mix of on-camera interviews, archival footage and recently discovered audiotapes of Lamarr explaining herself posthumously.",
            "By coloring Lamarr's life story in with shades of gray rather than distilling it to the black and white of \"film star\" or \"inventor\" or the like, a full picture of the woman-inquisitive, talented, flawed-comes into focus.",
            "The documentary is informative and thoroughly engaging with its narrative fluidity.",
            "A witty, fascinating and sometimes melancholic biography of a clever, complex and beautiful woman. It rattles along at an impressive pace, with a drive and verve of which inventor and Hollywood actress Hedy would surely have approved.",
            "This is a terrific introduction to a fascinating life. ",
            "The film succeeds in the more basic sense by surveying a complicated woman's existence. It also does so without diminishing the intimate details that help audiences relate to Lamarr's complexity not just as an icon, but as a human being.",
            "This documentary of actress and inventor Hedy Lamarr is engaging and poignant, expanding the view (and our understanding) of the famously beautiful Hollywood star.",
            "With a central thesis unable to fully grapple with her beauty and her intelligence, it ultimately fails to fully create a narrative of a woman who was more than her beauty, and more than brains-despite-her-beauty.",
            "A recently discovered set of 1990 interview tapes with this amazing woman fills out a detailed and revealing portrait.",
            "This film is packed with emotional kicks.",
            "The real tragedy against humanity uncovered by Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story is the millions of ideas that never came to light because society refused to listen to women.",
            "The movie star who inspired Snow White's face had bad luck in Hollywood, but she was a drop-dead beauty who saved countless lives.",
            "Alexandra Dean's documentary will fill you in on Lamarr's remarkable, if troubled, life. ",
            "A timely and emotional documentary on the former 40s and 50s Hollywood star Hedy Lamarr.",
            "Director Alexandra Dean's Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story doesn't shortchange Lamarr's career but also focuses on other aspects of Lamarr's fascinating, often tumultuous life."

            "Baahubali is a delight for all those who enjoy cinema as a visual medium... there is not much else, though."

            "It's a striking, if slightly silly, curio from the writer-director Hafsteinn Gunnar Sigurdsson: 85 minutes of Bergman-lite topped off with five minutes of Tarantino. ",
            "Opts for Grand Guignol over subtle nuance, but entertaining nonetheless.",

            "At a time where catharsis increasingly takes precedent over progress, Under the Tree has become essential. ",
            "The movie's humor is cooked at low temperature, discreetly, with small explosions of cruelty. ",
            "A deliciously dark satire that examines the fragile nature of civility in a suburban setting, where it can take very little to provoke savagery and the collapse of a delicate social order.",
            "Like something from Fargo, you'll laugh, feel bad for laughing, and then laugh again, with the crisp but stylish cinematography and direction also bringing to mind the same Coen classic.",

            "One of the most revealing films about mental health - and mental health bureaucracies - ever made.",
            "One might say the film is illuminating in its opacity: one comes to it expecting bold insights into mental illness but leaves with a new appreciation of how invisible such illness can be.",
            "12 Days ends with a lingering shot of a tree-lined street enveloped in thick fog. It's an obvious yet effective metaphor ... for the patients' mental conditions.",
            "Depardon's documentary does the key things: you learn about something you did not know and it is interesting.",
            "Depardon's fly-on-the-wall approach suggests Frederick Wiseman with fewer cutaways and a more limited focus. The film is fascinating, but leaves us with many questions unanswered.",
            "I found 12 Days to be a powerful film, but I also felt uncomfortably complicit watching these people reveal the intimate details of their lives before the camera. ",
            "Sane or insane, prisoners or protected, this simple set of interviews demands the viewer decide.",
            "Depardon attends. Depardon observes... gentle, yet impressively textured. Such simplicity, such directness, such compassion, such rapt attention to questions of power and class and the abrupt loss of agency in contemporary society. ",
            "Textured and troubled, rich in pointillist details, anything but a manifesto.",
            "Depardon's approach is patient, observant, unobtrusive ... but beneath this calm one feels the faint tremble of an anger held in check, a bottled-up scream.",
            "Psychiatric patients argue for their freedom in a challenging documentary from French director Raymond Depardon.",
            "For the most part Raymond Depardon's documentary is an engaging exploration into the lives of people at the very edge of society, filmed with warmth, humour and humanity.",
            "As Depardon's proudly humane film makes all too clear, there, but for the grace of God, go we all.",
            "The filmmaker maintains his lucidity regarding his institutional look, but his cinema seems to lose some of its strong internal coherence. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "The result is far from being the director's best film, but its human and sociological interest is more than remarkable. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Should be shown on screens large and small wherever quality docs find a home.",
            "It's a quietly devastating film.",
            "Rarely, if only in Urgences or classics like Frederick Wiseman's Titticut Follies or John Huston's Let There Be Light, has a filmmaker been able to document madness in such a direct way ..."

            "Is anything as improbable as a \"feel-good\" movie that actually leaves us feeling terrific? How about two of them in the same series?",
            "The Paddington films preach a message of acceptance that's no less straightforward than that of The Shape of Water, encouraging viewers to share in the hero's tolerant worldview. ",
            "How rare that a sequel improves upon its original, and rarer still is a perfect film. But Paddington 2 is both, encouraging gentleness, politeness, and decency.",
            "Paddington 2 surprised the hell out of me, and this is coming from somebody who loved the first. This is a sequel that doesn't disappoint.",
            "A dash of Wes Anderson and a sprinkle of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, swirled around with a wonderfully fluid sense of airiness and light. It's mannered, yet carefree, colorful, and evocative. ",

            "Its expert craftsmanship is keenly directed toward warming you with its wit, its unfussy kindness. At the centre of it all is a bear who's the real deal. That he's a CGI creation is at once impressive and enough to make your heart hurt.",
            "Everything from the sweet, precisely melodramatic performances to the King's mile-a-minute setups and payoffs works like a charm. ",
            "A new charming, sensitive and good work, once again under the belt of Paul King, becomes on its own merits one of the best movies of 2017. [Full Review in Spanish] ",

            "It's so rare to find a kids' movie that treats kids like kids, but not like idiots.",

            "Schreiber is outstanding as the title character, but he also has a great supporting cast.",
            "The acting saves Chuck from being just the umpteenth white boxer biopic, but we're fast approaching the copy-of-a-copy-of-a-copy stage of this genre.",

            "So, a reserved endorsement for Chuck. Like its main character, the movie stumbles and lumbers, but manages to survive.",
            "Chuck is a good movie about a noteworthy boxer because it shows his equally, if not more difficult battles out of the ring.",
            "If there's any justice, Schreiber will find himself in next year's Best Actor race for his performance here, as he completely inhabits the role.",

            "Yet you root for this movie the same way you might have rooted for Wepner. It's not a contender by any stretch of the imagination, but it has a certain tough, hard-earned nobility.",
            "Chuck is a more than a worthwhile footnote to the continuing cultural significance still enjoyed by Rocky.",
            "Chuck is a grueling, empathetic portrait of real-life heavyweight boxer Chuck Wepner.",

            "Beach Rats isn't a failure but it never fully lives up to the promise of its presence, as it's apprehensive to fully dive into the nature of toxic masculinity that may cause someone to hide their true selves out of fear of judgment by their friends.",
            "Beach Rats is a new take on a classic coming out story - and it feels thrillingly contemporary. This is undoubtably one of 2017's best LGBT films.",
            "It's unbearably sad. One wishes these stories were a thing of the past. That there was some hope for these guys, that they could live their truth without the fear of being ostracized and abandoned.",
            "Dickinson is breathtaking.",
            "As an exploration of toxic masculinity, a rarely seen side of New York, a teen's uncertainty, Beach Rats works beautifully, up to a point - but you can't take it out of the cultural context in which it appears.",

            "The fact that Clapton survived and eventually found happiness provides an upbeat ending to this story of his often tortured, tormented life.",
            "It's well resourced. It doesn't, however, have anything to take it to a higher plane.",
            "Life In 12 Bars illuminates the relatively short distance been this public and private self...",
            "The Clapton that emerges from Lili Fini Zanuck's excellent film is a highly complex, often generous but not always very nice man ...",
            "An involving look at one of Rock's greatest stories, though it is let down by its omissions and moments of self-indulgence. ",
            "This is a dark and honest heartbreaker, built around a trio of tragedies.",
            "It's a tale as old as time, yet throughout the 131 minutes (could have lost 20) of family videos, archive footage and doodles from the man himself, it's easy to see why he couldn't be held back.",
            "Contemporary fans may be a little disappointed with 12 Bars' shut-up-and-play-the-hits focus on the earlier years. But even agnostics are likely to get caught up in the drama of his painful upbringing and boozy, self-destructive years.",
            "Eric Clapton would became one of the world's greatest blues guitarists. Yet all the success in the world could not take away profound personal insecurity and an inability to trust for much of his life as this masterful film carefully documents.",
            "If you don't already consider 'Clapton is God', as the famous graffiti put it, then you'll be unconverted by this oddly distancing rock doc...Diverting enough, it nonetheless fails to fully delve into its subject."

            "Riffing on the idea of Stockholm Syndrome, in which a captive begins to identify with their kidnapper, Shortland's picture is an old school chiller, but one that is made by a female director with modern sensibilities to match.",

            "The fact that it winds up as empty and cynical as any made-by-a-committee movie is what murders it.",
            "Visually, sure, but even those get lost in the messy, often silly, and entirely uncoupled narrative.",
            "It lacks the definition and a good closure such as its preliminaries promised us. [Full Review in Spanish] ",

            "Focusing on the artist's work up to the creation of Eraserhead in 1977, The Art Life is utterly essential for his many followers. They may be surprised by how much of it makes sense.",
            "Crucial for serious fans of Lynch, even if it may baffle newcomers.",
            "Fans will make connections with Lynch's personal anecdotes and the images they know from his films, but watching the artist explain his work is never as interesting as the art itself.",
            "I didn't find the anecdotes especially revealing and was unimpressed by much of the art.",
            "What is so extraordinary about this film is that it doesn't show Lynch as the cinephile or the movie brat or even someone with any great interest in art history.",
            "Typically dreamlike, and occasionally unnerving, this biographical documentary is a must for David Lynch completists, and a fascinating curio for everyone else.",
            "Delicate and vital. Calm yet enthralling.",
            "The filmmakers do a great job keeping things simple, and let their subject be the one to muddy the artistic waters as only he can.",
            "This film... with its vivid biographical details, characteristically offbeat humor, and ponderous sequences of studio activity, seems destined to become an essential piece of Lynchelia.",
            "It is for committed fans, as his most famous films bar Eraserhead are not even mentioned, with the same going for his music. But for any long-time fans of the director or even anyone who loves painting, this is a very worthwhile watch.",
            "[Takes] you inside the head of Lynch. That may be a scary place to be, but man is it a treat.",
            "There are no easy answers when it comes to David Lynch. ",
            "Nothing is straight forward in this film, when it ended I felt I knew something about David Lynch, but really know nothing.",
            "The art life is [David Lynch's] religion, and the great thing about this documentary is that you believe it.",
            "How did the youngster who says he came from a \"super happy household\" end up as a cinema prince of darkness? While one cannot promise a clear answer to that, Lynch has some good stories to tell, particularly one about seeing Dylan in concert.",
            "Fortunately, despite this commendable attempt to unravel it, [David Lynch's] genius will remain a mystery. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Burrows deep under your skin 'til you're falling, falling ever more deeply into the subconscious of this haunting documentary's subject.",
            "Fans looking for hints at the meanings of his films will find no obvious ones [here] ... Listen closely to Lynch's stories from his youth, however, and you might be able to draw lines of inspiration to scenes that later manifested in his movies.",
            "To the best of my knowledge this is the first one in which he opens up about his early years, his childhood and college days.",
            "Everything the directors show is set against Lynch's homespun affect, which -- despite his constant cigarette smoking -- has a small-town quality that seems instantly at odds with the images that spring from his mind.",
            "A documentary that doesn't seek to approach David Lynch as a contemporary essential filmmaker, but to capture him as an artist in his day to day life. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "The authors of the film respectfully recorded the peculiar evocative speech, illustrating a vital and inseparable pulse from the artistic fact. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Lynch's elliptical story-telling mode lends the film a hypnotic quality, his measured voiceover complemented by a liberal use of slow-motion.",
            "It feels spontaneous, off-the-cuff, but by the end it's clear that this is a clearly structured, tightly argued tale."

            "Given the emphasis on sincerity and sweetness over argument and insight, maybe \"defense\" [of marriage] is the wrong word. Maybe it should be \"affirmation.\"",
            "If I Do...Until I Don't isn't completely successful, that doesn't mean it still isn't without merit, and in the end becomes the type of small-scale independent comedy I could easily see myself warming up to more and more as time goes by.",
            "I Do... Until I Don't marks a strange turn from the characteristic creativity of Bell's previous efforts. It isn't as painful as breaking up, but it gets close.",
            "The movie's satirical backbone softens and dissolves, and watching it go wrong might make you realize it wasn't that good to begin with - that Bell had been getting by on energy and the audience's goodwill.",
            "As a place for insightful thoughts and feelings about the complexities of marriage, it comes up short. The film's bigger crime is that the dialogue doesn't resemble actual human speech.",
            "The plot is all over the place and soon loses any connection, with everything being neatly tied up at the end and not really making much sense. ",

            "It leaves a lot to be desired and the pace of the movie doesn't help. [Full review in Spanish] ",
            "But the movie is disappointing both because it doesn't say anything new about relationships, and doesn't find a fresh way to say them.",
            "Bell is a generous writer, not keeping juicy lines to herself. I Do . . . Until I Don't fairly drips with them.",
            "It's a good cast, and there are a few bits that generate a laugh or two, but the overall concept seems as dusty as a 1950s sitcom.",
            "Don't say yes to this mess.",
            "Bell's script, which becomes too chaotic and cluttered in weaving together its storylines, features some scattered laughs but not much authenticity or insight into contemporary relationships.",
            "Right down to that insipid, cutesy-poo title, I Do...Until I Don't plays like a succession of bullet-point clich\u00e9s about love and sex and marriage that no one ever bothered to develop, connect together or base in any kind of reality.",
            "One essential detail keeps I Do...Until I Don't on the rails: Bell's eye behind the lens. ",
            "Why would Lake Bell deliver the kind of trite, annoying rom-com the major studios gave up making long ago?",
            "It soon enough settles into a predictable sub-Love Actually ensemble piece in which none of the individual stories are fleshed out enough to be of much interest. To note that this was made by What's the Point Productions is just too easy.",
            "As the writer-director-star of \"In a World ...,\" Lake Bell delivered one of the most underrated comedies of 2013. So expectations are high for her three-hat follow-up, \"I Do ... Until I Don't.\" But the dreaded sophomore slump hits, and hits her hard.",
            "I Do...Until I Don't ... [is] a film that feels as halfhearted as its title.",

            "There is a lot of humor about human nature to \"Dean\" as it meanders along to the hoped for happy ending. It is a light bit of youthful angst tempered by oft funny views of life."

            "This material might've worked better as sketches in an omnibus film.",

            "It ends a sweeter, more meaningful film than it begins.",
            "The lessons that Dean learns are pat and predictable, but this disarmingly winsome film is comfortable in the knowledge that universal truths can be the hardest things for people to discover for themselves.",
            "[Demetri Martin] makes the transition into feature filmmaking as writer, director and star with just the right blend of humor and heartbreak. ",
            "While the direction is capable, the writing isn't nearly as sharp as it needs to be.",
            "If Kevin Kline doesn't break your heart a few times in this film, you might be due for an emotional tune up.",
            "If you ever wondered whatever happened to Demetri Martin, here it is. ",
            "Despite the unevenness, Martin's cinematic exploration of empathy, loss, and father-son relationships makes for compelling viewing. ",
            "A film that lightly handles some very heavy and very important themes. Love, loss and longing all make an appearance -- never weighting the film but elevating it even further as they're all such universal experiences. ",
            "Dean is an entertaining little independent movie.",
            "Dean is a flawed movie that sometimes flubs implementing the same quirky visually stylistic touches that match the personality of the young man himself, but it's also an engaging dramedy with a striking sense of authenticity",
            "Mildly amusing and nicely acted by the supporting players, Dean nonetheless doesn't feel like a big-screen breakthrough for Martin, who doesn't dig deeply enough into the movie's most interesting element: undigested grief.",
            "It may not be the first movie you run off to the theater to see - probably not on a first date, anyway - but its high points are high enough to justify a look.",
            "A touching dramedy about the different styles of grief.",
            "Martin crafts an amusing vehicle for his usual mix of self-deprecation and social awkwardness, while also poking fun at technology, boorish millennials and other absurdities.",
            "Dean's triumph is that it feels very much like a definitive statement of a young artist, much in the way Garden State did for Zach Braff. ",
            "It is a brilliantly accomplished directing debut and never goes for cheap laughs or obvious plot contrivances.",
            "Dean is not, as it purports to be in nearly all of its marketing material, a \"comedy about tragedy.\" It's more like... a middling post-mumblecore dramedy about Demetri Martin wish-fulfilling himself into bed with Gillian Jacobs. Put that on a poster.",
            " Martin's script knows but one thing -- irony. It's his lifeblood, his shtick. But it's also his downfall.",
            "It all plays out in painstakingly milquetoast fashion.",
            "Yes, the story is rooted in grief, but it's too easily forgotten as the rest of Dean's life goes on. Martin may be great at sketches, but it takes more than sewing together a series of them to make a memorable movie.",
            "There is a lot of humor about human nature to \"Dean\" as it meanders along to the hoped for happy ending. It is a light bit of youthful angst tempered by oft funny views of life.",
            "Writer/actor/illustrator/stand-up comic Martin successfully adds \"director\" to his resume with this somewhat familiar but still funny and emotionally truthful dramedy. "

            "Justin Chon's Gook, an admittedly uneven film with a lot on its mind, acts as an ever-present undercurrent to a particular form of racial strife.",
            "The cacophonous result comes a lot closer to recapturing the spirit of Crash than to recapturing the spirit of 1990s independent cinema.",
            "Justin Chon looks at bigotry through the eyes of two Korean brothers in L.A.'s South Central in 1992. The result is hardass yet hypnotically beautiful.",

            "It'll put a smile on your face and provide an urge to write songs to revitalise your failing relationship. Or to get laid. Either way, watch it.",
            "For a film that beautifully illustrates how one can find the music in their every day lives, \"Band Aid\" doesn't miss a beat, but it'll make your heart skip one.",
            "If you've ever had relationship troubles or if you've ever been in a band (or both), there are a number of things to identify with in this profoundly earnest film. ",
            "The film tackles some heavy subject matter and does so in a way that rings true. Emotionally raw while being fun at the same time, Band Aid is a lovely film that explores marital problems in an original way. ",
            "This winning indie comedy-drama splits those two genres as neatly as an atom but gets the most energy out of the comedy side.",

            "Tower is portrayed as a solitary figure who has never recovered from the isolation of his early, formative years.",
            "The film's best achievement may be the way it reminds us that restaurants have become entertainments unto themselves.",

            "Its real revelation is in discovering this coulda-been-Gordon-Ramsay and his restaurants in their heyday, thanks to a surprisingly ample collection of archival footage and the colorful anecdotes.",
            "It's a moody, chilling tale of a respected artist beset by those demons, as well as his own.",
            "Jeremiah Tower: The Last Magnificent does give a haunting portrait of its protagonist whose tormented background gave him a vision of creating a place above the concerns of the ordinary world, buoyed by his culinary creations.",
            "The Tavern footage is terrific stuff - unstaged and unmediated and the closest the camera gets to penetrating the enigmatic yet magnetic chef.",
            "The documentary Jeremiah Tower: The Last Magnificent is as vibrant as its subject, who charms as he deflects the filmmakers' best efforts to plumb his depths.",
            "The sum total of the effort reveals a man who was exquisitely unique, yet every bit the classic artist stereotype: controlling, tormented, driven and lonely. ",

            "Tower's friends and disciples clearly care about this aging rogue, while accusing him of keeping his best secrets buried. The same can be said of the movie, which leaves its tastiest treats under heat lamps too long."

            "Other than in the broadest possible terms, I'm not sure we're given a clear sense of what makes Tower tick... But the movie is still watchable and amusing.",
            "It didn't give me a ton of new insight into the culinary world but was interesting.",
            "In spite of these reservations, if you care about food, and especially if you care about the history of American fine dining, and the evolution of California cuisine, The Last Magnificent is worth watching.",
            "Tower is portrayed as a solitary figure who has never recovered from the isolation of his early, formative years.",
            "The film's best achievement may be the way it reminds us that restaurants have become entertainments unto themselves.",
            "As profiled in Jeremiah Tower: The Last Magnificent, Tower defies easy characterization, a credit to this engrossing documentary.",
            "Its real revelation is in discovering this coulda-been-Gordon-Ramsay and his restaurants in their heyday, thanks to a surprisingly ample collection of archival footage and the colorful anecdotes.",
            "It's a moody, chilling tale of a respected artist beset by those demons, as well as his own.",
            "Jeremiah Tower: The Last Magnificent does give a haunting portrait of its protagonist whose tormented background gave him a vision of creating a place above the concerns of the ordinary world, buoyed by his culinary creations.",
            "The documentary Jeremiah Tower: The Last Magnificent is as vibrant as its subject, who charms as he deflects the filmmakers' best efforts to plumb his depths.",
            "The sum total of the effort reveals a man who was exquisitely unique, yet every bit the classic artist stereotype: controlling, tormented, driven and lonely. ",
            "Luckily, the mercurial Tower, whose legend includes a romantic mysterious disappearance from the restaurant scene, opens up to the camera revealing some secrets. The curious are rewarded.",
            "Tower stands tall and defiant, a survivor of egregious childhood neglect and multiple betrayals who still finds his cool in the warmth of a kitchen. ",
            "Fascinating occasionally unpleasant portrait of America's first celebrity chef.",
            "Tower's friends and disciples clearly care about this aging rogue, while accusing him of keeping his best secrets buried. The same can be said of the movie, which leaves its tastiest treats under heat lamps too long.",
            "Tower's life and career is laid out, with his controversies, successes and failings. But, I felt that the reason for his falling off the earth for so many years...were self imposed and often because of his ego."

            "All of the descriptive commentary is overshadowed by truly dazzling, awe-inspiring cinematography, some of it shown in a 60-Minutes profile of Hamilton but some of it new.",
            "The real draw in Take Every Wave is the many shots of Hamilton and others surfing big waves.",
            "The line between dedication and addiction is a thin one, and ... that line is even thinner for the surfer who's the subject of this involving documentary.",

            "A character study more than anything else.",

            "This slick, entertaining portrait won't provide many surprises for those who've followed the subject's high-profile career - as pretty much anyone interested in surfing has - but should fascinate others for whom he's a less familiar personality."

            "Rieger and Tagar capture the intimacy and competitive sniping of siblings, and they're each stunning in opposite roles.",
            "To Nesher's credit, \"Past Life\" never feels exploitative - a chief danger in mining the Holocaust for drama. But it also never fully coheres.",
            "Nesher has adapted a real-life memoir - Baruch Milch's \"Can Heaven Be Void?\" - into an overly contrived dramatic scenario. It's also something of a tease.",
            "Overstuffed and occasionally overwrought, the film is engrossing nonetheless, with a satisfying pace as Nesher juggles the numerous narrative elements.",
            "...an intelligent, convincing film for the most part, inspired by a true story. It takes place in the late 1970s.",
            "After all is said and done, this 1970s set tale may directly address some sore subjects often neglected in Israeli cinema but eventually curdles into an illogical soup of emotional misnomers. ",
            "Past Life is a polished and haunting drama that keeps the audience hooked with its suspenseful plot, affecting performances led by two strong female leads, and a heart-wrenching true story.",
            "Tagar and Rieger ably carry the film that asks what truth is and finds the answer is \"fluid\".",
            "As Sephi and Nana, actresses Joy Rieger and Nelly Tagar present their characters' contrasting personalities beautifully, sparring like real sisters. A fine supporting cast adds texture as does Yishai Steckler's soundtrack.",
            "A compelling character drama that doesn't need the gimmicks and tricks of a thriller to keep the audience invested.",
            "Muted, not wholly satisfying ghosts-of-the-Holocaust-live-on mystery that benefits from having a fresh direction to approach it from. ",
            "[Sephi] projects a formidable sense of determination... [Nana's] stinging barbs and memorable put-downs make poetry out of something as mundane as sibling rivalry.",
            "A striking and thought-provoking picture.",
            "A sober-minded Israeli film about sibling rivalry, secrets from the past, and the quest to express oneself creatively.",
            "\"Past Life\" is a page-turner that transforms into a clarion call: always compelling, but slightly stifled by noble intentions.",
            "\"Past Life\" is straight-ahead filmmaking heightened by a connection to a pervasive Israeli reality not often found on film.",
            "Threads are occasionally buried under the film's desire to satisfy mystery-thriller requirements, but Nesher allows the complex emotions they inspire to peek through just enough for an inspirational finale to play more effectively than it deserves.",
            "Its improbable story gives breath to the burden of fate on those living with a past unreconciled.",
            "A thoughtful look at the need for forgiveness.",
            "Avi Nesher's brilliant, haunting Past Life may be his best film yet -- and that's saying a lot.",
            "Ultimately, Past Life just doesn't work in any way, shape, or form...",
            "The strong performances ... and Nesher's dedication to the story's themes turn Past Life into a drama that might not be stellar, but is at least worth your time."

            "A captivating story with humour and profound sadness. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "While there's novelty and promise to Nyoni's little-girl-trapped tale, it tumbles into incoherence too early to merit endorsement.",

            "Yes, the leashes that bind these women are imaginary. But they're tied to real-world suffering. ... This is not a fantasy.",
            "For a first film, Ms. Nyoni not only shows intelligence in the way she addresses the topic, but also reinstates hope in the African cinema...",
            "In the debut of newcomer and previously untrained 9-year-old Maggie Mulubwa, the actress carries a sorrow that reads both weary and bone deep. She is compelling to watch and impossible to ignore.",
            "This story of an 8-year-old 'witch' literally tethered into servitude is both political expos\u00e9 and political satire; the sense of sorrow and anger is enhanced by director Rungano Nyoni's artist's appreciation of the absurdity at the root of tragedy. ",
            "Nyoni teases our assumptions of culpability. She paints portraits of implied mysticism with elegance and precision, slowing time and framing the girl as the center of the film's universe-not a witch, but a force to be reckoned with nevertheless.",
            "The filmmaker has crafted a portrait of institutionalized chauvinism that's undeniably on point but so vicious that the laughs are few and far between. In other words, this is not a popcorn moviegoer's satire.",
            "Nyoni's film has narrative ambiguities but it's a striking debut.",
            "If you like things to be spelled out, this is not the film for you.",

            "If you like things to be spelled out, this is not the film for you.",
            "Even if writer-director Rungano Nyoni's film were a lesser achievement - less unsettlingly complicated, less bitterly funny, less bluntly sad - it would still have the witch truck, one of the great cinematic images of this or any other year.",

            "A captivating story with humour and profound sadness. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "While there's novelty and promise to Nyoni's little-girl-trapped tale, it tumbles into incoherence too early to merit endorsement.",
            "Maggie Mulubwa is near expressionless throughout and barely speaks, but this makes all the difference, her wide eyes doing all the talking for her. ",
            "Yes, the leashes that bind these women are imaginary. But they're tied to real-world suffering. ... This is not a fantasy.",
            "For a first film, Ms. Nyoni not only shows intelligence in the way she addresses the topic, but also reinstates hope in the African cinema...",
            "In the debut of newcomer and previously untrained 9-year-old Maggie Mulubwa, the actress carries a sorrow that reads both weary and bone deep. She is compelling to watch and impossible to ignore.",
            "This story of an 8-year-old 'witch' literally tethered into servitude is both political expos\u00e9 and political satire; the sense of sorrow and anger is enhanced by director Rungano Nyoni's artist's appreciation of the absurdity at the root of tragedy. ",
            "The filmmaker has crafted a portrait of institutionalized chauvinism that's undeniably on point but so vicious that the laughs are few and far between. In other words, this is not a popcorn moviegoer's satire.",

            " An impressive debut from Zambian filmmaker Rungano Nyoni who manages to keep the film balanced and entertaining with a heavy dose of satire. ",
            "Nyoni's ability to craft such a multi-layered film and complex film is simply spellbinding.",

            "Not without humor, I Am Not a Witch ultimately rests on Shula's story, which builds toward a mournful and mysterious finale.",
            "I Am Not a Witch is subtly satirical, taking care to underline the performative nature of the witchcraft accusations and banishings.",
            "Packs a subtle gut punch by effortlessly mixing absurdist social critique and magical realism. ",
            "I Am Not a Witch, while suffused with a thread of dark humor, is a furious indictment of the way society continues to treat women and girls who do not fit neatly into the molds prescribed for them.",
            "There is a lot to say about how the world mistreats women-strong women-and Nyoni's approach might seem very flimsy when approaching such a large tapestry, but in the end, her film is invigorating and provocative."

            "The mountain backdrops are stunning, but the movie's real draw is its understanding of how children pick up more from their parents than their skeptical, self-pitying moms and dads ever imagine.",
            "Walking Out has an effect: Bomer is doing something different and he and Wiggins have believable father-son chemistry; the setting is gorgeous and desolate; and the hero's journey narrative is comfortingly familiar. ",
            "A spare but deeply affecting male weepie, in which the intensity of feeling between father and son can find expression only under the most extreme circumstances.",

            "Few movies have evinced such a specifically American understanding of the role that love plays (or doesn't) in becoming a man, or so openly confronted the notion that strength can only be passed down through suffering.",
            "Smith and Smith demand nuanced performances from the central pair which results in a credible story but nothing that hasn't been done before.",
            "While not quite the journey the film aspires to be, Walking Out bares enough sustenance to justify the trip.",
            "Walking Out is a textbook \"boy learning to become a man\" movie, that attempts to make its tropes feel fresh by presenting them as self-seriously as possible.",
            "Both [Matt] Bomer and [Josh] Wiggins do a terrific job of making the panic and fear of an unfamiliar situation seem real, but it's the [Andrew] Smiths who really make the scenario and snow-clad surroundings come alive.",
            "This battle-for-survival-type drama treads familiar territory and offers some warmth but never seems quite as powerful as it should be.",
            "Matt Bomer and Josh Wiggins' performances are moving in a slow-building way, buoyed by a gentle but affecting spirit. The same can be said of the film's direction. ",

            "When it does deliver, you can sense you are in the presence of something special.",
            "Walking Out is a perfectly serviceable, somewhat old-fashioned, robust drama, but not much more.",
            "This low budget film looks like a big budget film. The cinematography by Todd McMullen looks great, despite the fact that much of the shooting must have been done under difficult weather conditions in remote locations (mostly filmed in Montana).",

            "The story's poignancy stems from the knowledge that fathers and sons never really know one another. ",
            "... boasts moments of eerie loveliness, a pair of solid central performances, and enough confidence in the primitive engine of its story to know when to leave things unsaid."

            "His film may be a bit too obviously constructed as it hurtles towards its ambiguous close, but there is no denying the power and remove with which he realizes it.",
            "Harmonium wavers between elegantly composed long shots and flights of magic-realistic fancy. It's a tightly controlled storytelling gambit that pays off.",
            "It shocks us long after we walk out of the theater, not with the short-lived scare of a jump cut or grisly image, but with something darker that lives quietly in the unexamined places of the soul.",
            "This chilly tale of violent secrets and unvoiced misery relies heavily on the skill of actors who seem to know that one false move could tip the whole enterprise into comedy.",
            "By its unforgiving conclusion, Harmonium has plunged headlong into tragedy, but not quite in the way you might imagine.",
            "Just as in the best old-school, Cain-style noir, Fukada's film is eloquent about the fragile privileges of modern urban life and the hidden lies it can be built upon.",
            "Throughout Harmonium, writer-director K\u00f4ji Fukada works in a rapt and lucid hyper-textural style that suggests a merging of the sensibilities of Alfred Hitchcock and Yasujir\u00f4 Ozu.",
            "The softness and straightness of the performances obscure the monstrous melodrama underneath.",
            "Harmonium sees Japanese writer-director Koji Fukada flex his Hitchcock muscle to rather brilliant effect for the delicious first 90 minutes.",
            "Rather than employ Harmonium's setup for humorous or bittersweet insights, Fukada distills the conceit into his most harrowing, tragic parable to date.",
            "Tsutsui's tightly coiled performance is particularly compelling, a fury burning beneath her wearied, accommodating exterior.",
            "Harmonium builds uneasiness masterfully, and midway through a shocking act changes the film's direction entirely.",
            "A quietly tense examination of a family in slow freefall."

            "It's rare that a film makes you feel so acutely in its brief run-time, covering albums and addictions alike, but I Called Him Morgan accomplishes just that. ",
            "In the end, everyone involved in I Called Him Morgan seems sad but not surprised by the tragic turn of events. Which is life, pretty much.",
            "Collin's approach to this incendiary material is both blatant and oblique - a bit like Lee's playing itself. Thankfully, we hear quite a bit of that playing in the film.",
            "Morgan's relationship with Helen was so star-crossed and layered it's a mystery why the story hasn't yet been made into a biopic.",
            "There was no escaping the profound loss experienced on that evening, turning I Called Him Morgan into a musical story of sorrow and regret that plays as if its abrupt, agonizing outcome blindsided everyone, even if it was never really in doubt.",
            "I couldn't have anticipated that Swedish filmmaker Kasper Collin would provide such a personal and moving portrait of the musician, who died at age 33. You don't have to love jazz to be drawn into this remarkable story",
            "Musicians sometimes paraphrase Debussy, or one another, in saying that music is the silence between the notes. I Called Him Morgan has it all -- the notes and the silence, plus the music of spoken language, pitched in rueful tones of recollection.",
            "Using a dazzling blend of cinematic tools, aural as well as visual, Collin recreates both individual lives and an entire world."

            "The film version of My Fair Lady is a ceremonious bore, and the viewer has Cecil Beaton's pompously sedentary, open-casket visual compositions to blame.",
            "Thorough and pleasurable - if lightweight...",
            "Cecil Beaton is one of those names that rings out in any history of 20th century art and culture. This entertaining and candid film explains why.",
            "38 years after his death, Beaton's name is not so much on everyone's lips, and one of the pleasures of this film is to revisit his gifts beyond his best known work, the Oscar-winning production design and costumes for \"My Fair Lady.\"",
            "An unavoidable shortcoming of the documentary is the absence of Beaton's peers. Somewhat making up for that is an even more dazzling lineup of period film clips and vintage photographs.",
            "This documentary tribute is colorful if somewhat frustrating, though that may be inevitable...",
            "Love, Cecil doesn't shy away from Beaton's contradictions or from his being something of a poseur -- at times he almost embraced the double life he was leading -- and that makes the film all the more watchable and substantive. ",
            "Cecil is all here: from his outsize talent to his eagle eye, from his snobbery, class consciousness, and prejudice to his openness to the new, the spontaneous, and the visual knockout.",
            "There's no denying the talent of Cecil Beaton, nor the scale of his influence to this day. But whether you leave the documentary having warmed to him is another question altogether, and is part of what makes Vreeland's film such an intriguing watch.",
            "Vreeland makes a concerted effort to probe beyond the Cecil Beaton the world knows.",
            "Even with incredible access to his output, his personal diaries and his remaining friends, Vreeland is perhaps too respectful of her subject's secrets.",
            "Juicy gossip aside, Vreeland's documentary introduces us to the work of a man who wrote, took pictures, designed and drew -- and did all of these with skill and a well-honed aesthetic.",
            "Love, Cecil isn't necessarily breaking new ground on the man, but director Lisa Immordino Vreeland's documentary is a complete, nuanced, entertaining portrait of an artist who, if alive today, would have an incredible Instagram.",
            "The director doesn't set out to reinvent the wheel, but what her film lacks in inventiveness and creativity, it compensates in a willingness to explore the Renaissance man at its core with clarity and compassion.",
            "Love, Cecil uses Beaton's diaries as a primary source, and doesn't necessarily shy away from his darker side... For all his flaws, Cecil still offered a lot to love.",
            "There are hints of brilliance in how the documentary is constructed... It's unfortunate that the way Love, Cecil is paced, then, means that it's easy for your mind to wander. ",
            "Beaton dismissed a flattering TV documentary about him as \"inconclusive and superficial.\" The same, I'm afraid, could be said about Love, Cecil.",
            "The result is a perfectly pleasant film about a mostly-pleasant subject that ends up expressing little of lasting interest about its subject or the implications of his life.",
            "A test of hagiographic patience that's more interested in Beaton's personality quirks than his career.",

            "This portrait of Oscar winning photographer, and costume and set designer Cecil Beaton is a must see for art lovers.",
            " A visual feast.",

            "A slightly tacky horror picture which makes quite an impact; partly, I suspect, by ingeniously playing off its own limitations.",

            "What's truly remarkable is how, after half a century and an uncountable number of zombie films, novels, comics, TV shows, and video games, you can watch the original Night of the Living Dead and it still feels fresh and terrifying.",
            "Combined with Romero's political commentary is a cinematic aesthetic that arguably outstrips its sequels in both craft and effectiveness.",
            "Night of the Living Dead (1968) is the first genuinely modern horror movie, shot more like a documentary of the apocalypse than the Gothic horrors that defined the sixties, and it bled right into the fabric of the culture.",
            " A landmark of American cinema. Intentional or not, the film's sociopolitical content remains as potent as ever.",
            "All in all, Night of the Living Dead is obviously just as marvellous as it's always been.",
            "Carve[s] open the guts of American culture, using violence and even the horror genre itself as a tool rather than an end.",
            "Director George A Romero redefined the meaning of horror for fear-sated audiences in the 1960s with this seminal classic.",

            "There is a lot of sin to go around in Mudbound, a film whose agrarian setting feels like a sort of Paradise Lost.",
            "The cast is one of the reasons to defend 'Mudbound', since it delivers powerful moments. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "To watch Mudbound is to remember that unfathomably disgusting crimes perpetrated against the black community aren't just stored in paper, film and photographs; they're stored in the actual memories of those still living.",
            "Takes a familiar story and makes it feel fresh, and is the perfect example of why we need more films directed by women and people of color. ",
            "Like the mud, it makes you feel dirty and you cannot wash it off. It's not a comfortable feeling, and it's not meant to be. Instead, Mudbound challenges you to identify with these broken people. And we do.",
            "It's well-made, well-shot and well-cast, just slightly turgid in its approach, which results in turning the viewer off rather than engaging with their emotions and sense of justice throughout.",
            "Mudbound is a modern American tragedy where none of the characters escape unscathed, and no good deed goes unpunished. ",
            "It wears its literary strengths on its sleeve through poetic narration and an emphasis on dialogue. Yet its cinematography and color palette are equally striking; the greens, golds and browns of the WWII-era Mississippi farmland glow with vibrancy."

            "It's a series of fight scenes that build to a climax that is surprisingly unsatisfying in the way it ultimately plays out.",
            "At least it attempts to break every bone introduced, which will appease less discerning action fans.",
            "Hill is definitely not at the top of his game here, though he handles the gun play decently enough and has certainly added a spark to Stallone's performance. ",
            "This was an homage to action movies from the 1980s that didn't do anything to update itself for a modern audience.",
            "Wanton disregard for human life is the point of the whole movie, and when Hill lets his protagonist out to play, \"Bullet to the Head\" is best. The rest of the time, when they try to insert story or character-or any time there are words-problems arise.",
            "Much like its star, it's a film from another era, and at its heart pulses a steely verve that is sorely missing in many modern action films.",
            "Will appeal to certain audiences, and those hoping for silly fun in the vein of throwaway one-liners and axe-fight showdowns will not be disappointed. For others, Stallone's latest is best viewed on smaller screens, if at all.",
            "I can hardly call Bullet to the Head bad; it's just so bland on pretty much every level that there's not much to say but 'meh'.",
            "Although Bullet to the Head comes nowhere near the pantheon of the great buddy movies, and some fans of the original graphic novel might wince at the changes, there's enough fun to be had...",
            "At times it feels as though the whole thing has been scrubbed clean of anything resembling theme.",
            "Bullet to the Head is an adrenaline-fueled, rip-roaring good time that asks little of audiences while still managing to fill their most basic filmgoing needs.",
            "Stallone's dead eyes are betrayed only occasionally by glimmers of humanity: when he spares a would-be victim who happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, or when he takes vengeance upon a particularly bad bad guy.",
            "A worthy callback to Stallone's glory days.",
            "The movie's titled Bullet to the Head, what the heck do you think it's going to be?",
            "It says \"revenge never gets old.\" Yeah, but Sylvester Stallone did. Yikes. ",
            "A big, dumb action film that charges forward believing Stallone is charismatic enough to sell even bad writing. He's not.",
            "Walter Hill's Bullet to the Head is a gritty and tough throwback to times when action films were simple, fun and still considered entertaining and worth the money. ",
            "As unsubtle as its title, this action film is repetitive and packed with silly cliches that should be put to sleep.",
            "Nothing to write home about, but with some decent fight sequences, good stunts, and amusing banter between Stallone and Kang. No need to rush out to the cineplex, although worthwhile to catch on-demand later this year."

            "Doesn't plumb the depths of adolescent emotions and high-school politics so much as skims the surface in a psychedelic dinghy.",
            "Mostly - as that title deserves - it's a funny, imaginative trip down a high-school rabbit hole, in which we're reminded that catastrophic disasters may come and go but what matters in high school is where you fit on the school's social ranking.",

            "My Entire High School Sinking into the Sea is uniquely excellent because it relies heavily on a resource that few other animated features have: a powerful visual grammar that has been finely honed in the trenches of comics storytelling. ",
            "Shaw's mixture of variously textured animations helps create a rather psychedelic palette, jarring wonderfully with a manic score from Rani Sharone.",
            "Succeeds through Shaw's unique visual style, but it rises to another level thanks to the impeccable vocal casting.",
            "A funny, sad, strange, and altogether wonderful film that will speak to anyone who ever felt lost on the stormy and at times disorienting seas of adolescence.",
            "Deadpan to a fault, with monotone line readings that feel unnaturally disconnected, a tone that lacks command and a story that feels feckless and bored.",

            "My Entire High School Sinking into the Sea is good for so many reasons, namely the unique video art and talented cast are the obvious ones, but what really resonated with me was the number of poignant moments happening at the most unexpected times.",
            "Mythologizing one's adolescence has rarely been driven home with such imaginative force.",

            "An antidote to overly elaborate action films, John Wick: Chapter 2 doubles down on both the mythology and the violence of the first film, delivering a great followup that doesn't lose sight of what makes it so damn entertaining.",
            "John Wick: Chapter 2 doesn't radically subvert the genre, but it doesn't intend to. What it does is something so much better: it loves it and celebrates it with charm, skill and devotion.",
            "John Wick: Chapter 2 delivers another full-throttle round of brutal, beautiful violence.",
            "Basically this is a film about nothing, but you could also call it art for art's sake, with some of the most elegant action since the 1980s heyday of Walter Hill.",
            "An adrenaline-pumping blockbuster polished to near perfection, save its sequel-baiting conclusion.",
            "John Wick laid out the basics of its codified criminal community, but Chapter 2 builds from them an intricate world that has the claustrophobic quality of any professional industry.",
            "If you aren't excited for a third chapter when the credits start to roll, check your pulse; you might have died from shock.",
            "A decent film for those seeking nothing more than escapist action devoid of CGI.",
            "The elegance of this action packed sequel is marvelled and celebrated in its brutal 'gun-fu' violence. While it struggles to reach the heights of its surprisingly entertaining predecessor, John Wick: Chapter 2 certainly raises the bar for action films.",
            "There's betrayal, murder, and when John Wick finds out he has a price on his head, he goes revenging and kills...well, everyone. Sound perfect, right?",
            "John Wick: Chapter 2 does what any good sequel should: It ups the action, ups the stakes and keeps the story moving in a forward direction.",
            "As phlegmatic assassin John Wick, Reeve's svelte and photogenic demeanour is paraded with grace and pride. Director Chad Stahelski loves his leading man, understands his appeal and shoots him accordingly as a killer on a catwalk.",
            "The creative team blows open the doors to this secret world and allows viewers inside this dark world where Wick (the appropriately understated Keanu Reeves) made his home... And boy, do they make it fun again.",
            "John Wick: Chapter 2 isn't just a great action movie. It's one of the best action movies ever made, and it stands alongside other classics like The Raid, Mad Max: Fury Road and Hard Boiled.",
            "[Keanu] Reeves's Zen-like cool serves him well here. He's like an athlete resorting to muscle memory, lethal and lightning quick as he automatically falls into what he's done best.",
            "Stahelski's kinetic direction keeps things moving, even if there are way too many shots to the head.",
            "John Wick 2 delivers action, plenty of guns and a hint of class, providing the necessary action and narrative to develop this growing franchise.",
            "Wickedly delicious!",
            "John Wick Chapter 2 escalates and expands on the original in nearly every respect to create one hell of a ride, provided you can suspend your disbelief a tad higher than with the first film.",
            "Director Chad Stahelski has taken his winning formula of the original John Wick and amped up the car chases, gun battles, and the overall body count. ",
            "It can be taken in the same unprejudiced spirit as the savagery of its action scenes or its final delusional, which make us anxiously await for a conclusion of the trilogy. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "It is a lot of plot, complicated connections and underworld characters to carry, which tends weigh down the whole film after awhile. The whole cast is great, but it is a bit like too much of a rich, delicious dessert all at once.",
            "If John Wick: Chapter 2 follows a man trying to work within a corrupted system by following the corrugated rules of that establishment, the finale leaves the door open for an even more fascinating follow-up.",
            "John Wick: Chapter 2 takes the slick, no nonsense action of the original and builds upon the world it inhabits while delivering top notch action scenes."

            "The trouble comes with the script as newcomer writer Stephanie Fabrizi struggles with hollow dialogue and flimsy story and character development."

            "[An] engaging documentary ...",
            "Spettacolo stands as a testament to making art in the face of general indifference and worldly decline, and the belief that a can-do spirit and deep-seated cynicism are not mutually exclusive ideas.",
            "We sense the pride these people take in this work. One of the film's most beautiful passages is a montage of different townsfolk - a teacher, a woman hanging laundry, a clerk behind a desk - practicing their lines as they go about their day.",
            "It feels wrong, almost insulting, to call \"Spettacolo\" charming, even if the movie is often delightful.",

            "Inspiring film about small town villagers working towards a common artistic vision, but an unfortunately rushed climax and a missed opportunity to memorialize their performances.",
            "While it's increasingly saddening in \"Spettacolo\" to consider that a place as unique as this tight-knit community isn't immune to such concerns, to see the amateur dramatists forge ahead is equally if not more invigorating.",
            "A beautiful, melancholic rumination on the struggle to preserve cultural tradition in the face of modern economic forces.",
            "Spettacolo may not have the structural ingenuity of the filmmakers' previous work, but as a contemplation of identity and the value and comfort people find in telling their own stories, it makes for an engaging, entirely absorbing experience.",
            "Beautiful, tragic, but not without joy, Spettacolo is a great film about the search for meaning. Did I dream it? I hope not.",
            "This is not about just any play, it is an 'autodrama,' written and performed by the people of the town about themselves, their hopes, their history, their concerns about the changes happening in their country and in their town.",
            "Malmberg and Shellen carefully and respectfully capture a pivotal moment wherein the townsfolk grapple with the rapid change and gentrification of their small hillside village",

            "Spettacolo is a cultural rumination more than a documentary... It's a grassroots illustration of the instinct to preserve cultural tradition.",
            "Certainly, it will be difficult for many American viewers to resist not only the vacation porn, but the vision of a village so intimately bonded by its years of collective self-expression that it's nearly a social ideal.",
            "A quietly ruminative view of how art and tradition are so often intertwined, and how the rapidly changing modern world affects these two cultural artifacts.",
            "You'll probably never forget this extraordinary town. But the film itself is largely unmemorable.",
            "An evocative but not fully fleshed-out documentary about a theatrical tradition that's lasted for half a century and may be coming to an end in a Tuscany village.",
            "Though some of Spettacolo's tension is superficial, the stuff of any let's-put-on-a-show narrative, its latent anxieties are myriad and profoundly resonant.",
            "As sobering as all this sounds, the movie is not a downer. There's so much to admire in the players' creativity and courage to speak their minds.",

            "If only all of our third acts turned out that way.",
            "He may have begun the years-long project to illustrate Turner's accomplishments, but Korem ended up with a richer profile of a perfectionist who realizes he still has things to learn.",
            "\"Dealt\" achieves the neat trick of giving its main subject a rewarding character arc.",
            "The card magician Richard Turner reveals that he has more than just a few tricks up his sleeve in Luke Korem's captivating documentary \"Dealt.\"",
            "His wife even claims she's caught him practicing during sex. ",
            "[T]he way that it introduces its subject, follows him through a turning point in his life, and conveys it all with a purposeful cinematicity just begs to be unpacked.",
            "A moving account of a family overcoming disability as well as a kind of advocacy piece for the nationwide legalization of gambling.",
            "\"Dealt\" is a documentary of such deep human beauty that the less you know going in, the more fresh your experience will be when you watch the film. ",
            "Beloved and admired, Turner has led a full life, and Dealt is a fitting tribute to his many accomplishments.",
            "A lively and endlessly fascinating documentary that achieves a rewarding intimacy with its subject, Dealt holds all the aces.",
            "Richard Turner is an amazing figure.",
            "If you thought card tricks by sighted people were neat, you ain't seen nothin' yet.",
            "The film's story is deeply moving, and Korem wisely doesn't doll it up with a lot of fancy, stylized cinematic sleight of hand.",
            "The documentary Dealt tells a fascinating and inspirational story about a charming individual, but the movie takes way too long to tell it.",
            "Magicians aren't supposed to reveal their secrets, but this compelling documentary provides plenty of insight.",
            "In Dealt, director Luke Koren masterfully tells the story of a man, who through hard work and discipline overcame his disability. ",
            "It's well shot but never flashy, and it's well cut, making for a generally rounded film that disappears behind the larger than life personality at its core, a height few films manage to reach.",
            "Lively and informative documentary about a brilliant sleight-of-hand magician who has a black belt in karate-and is blind.",
            "The charismatic subject of this doc may be blind, but he's obviously playing with a full deck.",
            "Richard Turner is a charismatic subject who demands more than a conventionally entertaining documentary. ",
            "A polished portrait that should play very well to those with eye disease and to those who support them.",
            "Richard Turner's story is inspirational and makes you think about your life and shortcomings. This is the type of documentary that will make you feel alive while reminding the viewer to always live each day to the fullest."

            "The movie's both haunting and honest, confronting what it's like to see the community that sustains you die right in front of your eyes.",
            "Where another filmmaker might have revelled in Uncertain's poverty and crime statistics, these directors find the sweetness in the saltiest of subjects and majesty in infested waters.",
            "The most interesting of them by far is Wayne... the filmmakers follow him on numerous midnight expeditions to take down a giant beast called Mister Ed, but the real night terror turns out to be Wayne's remorse for the crimes he's committed. ",
            "The film is shot and edited with a wry humour that balances out the darker themes of life on the periphery.",
            "With the support of Daniel Hart's almost elegiac score, the filmmakers distill the coarse poetry in their surroundings, giving voice to the suspended dreams of the locals.",
            "Uncertain is a vivid, pungent ode into a world that is fast disappearing.",
            "It's not just the three subjects that make Uncertain such a wonderful documentary. McNicol and Sandilands find a way to, on a greater scale, give an incredible sense of what it's like to live.",
            "Its achievement is to make you care about these lives and the struggles of a small community on the brink of extinction in a nowhere place that at first seems to be so remote and so alien.",
            "Although the film has a bitter, melancholy feel to it, the narrative reaches a satisfying conclusion and all three men show how powerful hope can be.",
            "[It's] a work that combines personal confessions with sublime beauty and a pending ecological disaster. It's also a film about the kind of people who voted for Trump.",
            "The images come quickly if not furiously, the camera mesmerized by imagery high and low, a succession of jagged-around-the-edges Terrence Malick-type tableaux. The men's stories sear with the force of troubled lives lived rough.",
            "Uncertain is somber and effective work of mood and tone - a study of time and place, biography and geography that offers a slice of life that's perhaps cut a little too thin.",
            "With enormous themes illustrated with the tiniest of creatures, the most characterful of characters, and some stunning photography, Uncertain is a phenomenal debut. ",
            "If someone had invented a place like the city of Uncertain, Texas, for a work of fiction, it would beggar belief.",
            "[A] handsome and heartfelt study of the America neglected by the cosmopolitan elite.",
            "A worthy addition to the genre that includes \"Vernon, Florida\" and \"Pleasures and Plagues of the Salton Sea\".",
            "A fantastic piece of observational filmmaking about a small town on the edge of Texas and three of the men who live there.",
            "A very fine film.",
            "Uncertain is a film content to be small, one that knows that every atom is a universe.",
            "The result is a truly engrossing film, one of the year's best nonfiction portraits of the natural world.",
            "Beautifully photographed by co-director McNicol, the film is a hauntingly evocative portrait of its Southern Gothic-infused milieu.",
            "...a marvelous, absorbing, and somewhat intoxicating whole."

            " Although there is a formulaic quality to the film's structure, smart casting and an impressive restraint shine through, allowing the bittersweetness of Carrie's ever-frustrating quest to let her emotional maturity catch up with her mental prowess.",
            "Watching Carrie Pilby try to navigate her life is often cringeworthy for me in particular, but that desire to cringe and cover my face with embarrassment attests to the strength of the character and of Powley's performance.",
            "Carrie needs a better movie, but Powley finds just enough authenticity amid the minefield of narrative contrivances to make the film worthwhile.",
            "Powley is a good actress, but she plays a protagonist whose motivations flip-flop too conveniently, such that by the end, it is hard not to feel cheated.",

            "The quirky setups, oddball interactions and erratic conflicts ... provide ample doses of amusement and provocation to keep things afloat.",
            "An example of both the compelling passion and polarizing fallibility that can arise when a director works primarily from the heart.",
            "Babak Jalali's dramedy is an affirmation of the trans-cultural aspect of art, but also notes the irresolvable sadness when one no longer resides in the homeland that once fed one's soul.",
            "The laid-back spirits of Jim Jarmusch, Wim Wenders, and Christopher Guest inform Radio Dreams, which follows an amusing batch of characters on a slow journey of (semi-) self-discovery.",
            "Well worth tuning in for.",
            "Not much happens in Babak Jalali's Radio Dreams, but that's all right. This is a comedy of gentle chaos; you just sort of coast along with it, smiling and occasionally chuckling.",
            "Jalali has created something beautiful from not much in this low budget, sometimes whimsical, sometimes moving day in the life. These uncomfortable moments lead us to a better understanding of people with whom we have no common cultural lexicon.",
            "The uneven but amusing script celebrates the unifying powers of art and culture while layering such observations with sociopolitical context.",
            "There are traces of early Wim Wenders in this story of immigrants adrift in a world not their own, trying to make the best of things.",
            "The film examines, with wit and patience, the hard work of community-building - and the toll on someone far from home, doing work that's not his calling.",

            "Thoughtful and amusing.",
            "We want additional time with these characters, and that's a credit to this film: Like Hamid, we yearn for even more.",

            "Emile Hirsch and Zoe Kravitz, as strangers thrown together by a violent incident, enjoy an easy chemistry here, encouraging viewers to forget the menace that starts the story and, with startling violence, will end it.",
            "Genre clich\u00e9s catch up with Schultz just as surely as the past catches up with his characters and the sweet, redemptive possibilities of their relationship gets washed away in the tide of gratuitous bloodshed.",
            "Aspirations matter, and the cast members remain dedicated to their brooding roles as the script admirably reaches for emotions it only sometimes captures.",
            "This uneven rural romance and thriller has echoes of Terrence Malick, Jeff Nichols and Andrew Dominik, but its dueling tones battle with neither side emerging victorious.",
            "Underwhelming and underdeveloped, everything about what should have made this story dark and edgy - the material is all there is no doubt about that - falls disappointingly flat instead.",
            "After flashing some imaginative style and attitude, this ultraviolent crime thriller devolves into a routine tale of outsider romance and revenge.",
            "The magic of Vincent N Roxxy comes from the performances. If there was any justice in the movie world, Zoe Kravitz's work here would propel her onto the A-list.",
            "Two people you'll wish you hadn't met... just an oddly bland would-be romance followed by a long spasm of ultra-violence. ",
            "A good cast and hint of low-down style can't save this drawn-out/bleed-out revenge thriller set in BFE Lousiana. ",
            "Schultz cranks up aggression and ends up suffocating the effort, displaying a callous disregard for tone to go with the feature's overall incompleteness.",
            "Suffers from many of the same shortcomings that plagued tough-talking Tarantino homages in the late '90s but distinguishes itself with a satisfying climax.",
            "As a sophomore feature (for director Gary Michael Schultz) this isn't bad, and it certainly has its moments, but ultimately it's a Thursday night DVD thriller rather than the Saturday night headliner Kravitz's work deserves.",
            "By the end, the point-blank murders might make you queasy, but Kravitz still manages to project composure, even when her face is covered in blood.",
            "Its gory conclusion is presented with an ostentatious grandiosity that the rest of the film simply doesn't justify.",
            "Pity that the bloody finale only makes up for the last third of what's otherwise pretty dreary."

            "[For Ahkeem] is a compelling but often frustrating documentary, a microcosm of the struggles faced by many disadvantaged young people of color today. ",
            "For Ahkeem doesn't present anything new, but perhaps there's no need to: Its focus on one young woman struggling to graduate implicitly says that no matter how common the story, every person matters.",

            "For Ahkeem is an essential insight into marginalized America. ",
            "Van Soest and Levine were in production when Ferguson exploded over the police shooting of Michael Brown, and they're smart enough to keep those events in the background as a running reminder of what can happen to Black youth in the St. Louis area.",
            "There's a strong dose of anthropology in this documentary, as the filmmakers construct the small world in which Daje lives and interacts with young people like herself - all black, all poor, mostly fatherless. ",
            "For Ahkeem strikes a hopeful chord.",
            "The story that is told here, with such heartbreaking clarity, is an important one, but it is hard to watch.",
            "About as close as documentaries come to putting us inside the mind of someone who society easily overlooks.",
            "The movie isn't explicitly message heavy but by telling the story of Daje without reality show-type finagling, there is a clear message to see people beyond their stats, voting demographics and segments on cable news.",
            "While the film ends at a logical stopping point, it feels incomplete. It probably could have used a few more years of filming.",
            "A rich, inspiring, and at times infuriating evocation of Daje's inner life.",
            "The weight of the systemic racism they experience is crushing enough to make it hard to imagine that Daje and Antoine will be able to offer their son any more opportunities than they have themselves.",
            "An illuminating film about poverty that one hopes can be a call for action even if the film itself doesn't directly encourage advocacy.",
            "There's some footage that feels suspiciously finessed for storytelling purposes, but whenever Daje's onscreen it's impossible not to be moved.",
            "It's a sort of bad-luck situation most documentarians secretly dream of, but to their credit, For Ahkeem's co-directors don't exploit the situation, merely letting their cameras continue to capture Daje's ever-dire situation."

            "This is neither a hopeful nor a hopeless film, but one of feeling so colossal and resplendent, it can't be constrained by prison or consumed by fire.",
            "In the hands of the great Danish director Carl Theodor Dreyer it becomes a potent saga of battered faith, vicious bullying and personal torment.",
            "Here is a deadly tiresome picture that merely makes an attempt to narrate without sound or dialog an allegedly written recorded trial in the 15th or 16th century of Joan of Arc for witchery, leading to her condemnation and burning at the stake.",
            "Dreyer's radical approach to constructing space and the slow intensity of his mobile style make this \"difficult\" in the sense that, like all the greatest films, it reinvents the world from the ground up.",
            "One of the most inspired and inspiring films ever made.",
            "Director Carl Dreyer establishes himself as a master of the camera, and uncovers a directorial treatment that is entirely original and unique.",
            "The showing of close-ups is used as a means of unfolding the tale, which depicts the last six hours of Joan's life, her trial and death. The lack of story and essential support leaves most of the work to Mlle. Falconetti, and she handles it admirably.",
            "The Passion of Joan of Arc is nothing without that face. Falconetti's features are both youthful and weathered; her expressions are tortured but joyous. It's a spectacular performance.",
            "The camera is like a microscope, peering into the souls of the legions of men circling around Joan like a pack of hyenas, trying to break down her soul and force a confession.",
            "La Passion d'Jeanne d'Arc, though static and experimental, has some of the most beautiful close-ups in the history of cinema, and ranks high for emotional quality.",
            "The consummate work of cinema.",
            "[Jeanne d'Arc] is an historical film, but not a costume film; an historical film that is contemporaneous in its universal references. [It] is a religious film, but not a sanctimonious film. Life, it urges, is transcendent. It is a transcendent film.",
            "Mannered and arty -- how many close-ups of the same mood is too many? No, not a great film. But a good one.",
            "If ever the divine was captured on film, Dreyer did so in his transcendent 1928 masterpiece.",
            "What more can be said about its style, its acting, its editing, its impact on the industry, its influence on cinematic art?",
            "a pinnacle of silent film art, expressive acting, and naturalistic intensity",
            "Falconetti's visage in Carl Th. Dreyer's silent classic La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc produces some of the most indelible images in film history.",
            "The film makes for an intimately unsettling watch, as Dreyer's style of shooting (harsh angles to go along with all those up-close-and-personal visages) traps the viewer as much as the players.",
            "It is likewise masterful: so rich, so gorgeous and muscular in its register of tones, in the deep, smoky darkness, that I felt the cold of the castle scenes in watching it.",
            "...constructed largely of close-ups and was filmed on a single concrete set representing the prison where Joan of Arc was imprisoned ...",
            "While strong with French nationalistic sentiment, it was made by a Danish director and a German designer, but its powerful message speaks to people of all nations.",
            "This was Falconetti's only major film and over a period of a year under Dreyer's direction (a combination of cruelty and patience), her extraordinarily expressive face made for one of the greatest, most harrowing screen performances.",
            "With her wide and expressive eyes, eyes that lock onto the spectator, conveying both hope and despair in the same instant, Falconetti delivers one of the most sublime and gripping of film acting performances."

            "The biographical details are of far less interest to Collins than the music, and the film will be a particular delight to lovers of Irish folk music, with its keening textures and melancholic tones.",
            "Director Pat Collins's approach to visual composition is more interesting in theory than practice.",
            "More than the story of an individual, the film is a stirring tribute to endangered folk traditions.",
            "... the picture remains proudly awkward, original and surprising throughout.",
            "If Andrei Tarkovsky had grown up in rural Ireland, he might have made a biographical cine-memoir as luminously beautiful as Song of Granite.",
            "This patient and luminous life-of-the-artist film freshens everything stale about its genre.",
            "I admired Song of Granite much more than I 'enjoyed' it.",
            "Using an impressionistic, avant-garde style...its beauty and heartbreaking sense of lost connection to the past expresses much more than the usual corny sentimentalism.",
            "Song of Granite is a unique portrait of a man's life; breathtakingly cinematic in black and white film.",
            "Difficult film to enjoy. Presented in a loose, arty structure of disordered scenes and stock footage, anything after the first 20 minutes or so is extremely hard to get a handle on.",
            "Beautifully shot, this dramatised documentary is a lyrical hymn to a country and a man - but it's occasionally unsatisfying, like reading a brilliantly intriguing biography with a few key pages missing. ",
            "... one of the most adventurous explorations in the field of the musical documentary. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "The director and co-writer Pat Collins does a superb job with this strange biopic of Joe Heaney, a sean n\u00f3s singer who became a big name in American folk music.",
            "An elliptic, bracingly experimental feature told mostly in Gaelic. ",
            "An enchanting lyrical look at the life of the enigmatic legendary traditional sean n\u00f3s singer Joe Heaney.",
            "If accepted, Song of Granite's potency will blindside you.",
            "The film's monochromatic images are so beautiful they're almost as soul-nourishing as the transporting vocals and otherworldly reels the soundtrack envelopes us in.",
            "Song of Granite will be a very important film this year and I highly recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest in Irish culture.",
            "A work of genius.",
            "Song of Granite was filmed in black and white by Richard Kendrick and is staggeringly beautiful.",
            "Pat Collins' film about the life and career of Irish folk singer Joe Heaney is oblique to the point of inscrutability.",
            "There's a unifying purpose to this seemingly scattered approach, underlining the essential unknowability of a retiring figure who left principally his art as evidence of a jagged, unstable life.",
            "Mr. Collins doesn't shed light on what makes his subject tick, and the arty shards never cohere.",
            "There is a dream-like quality to this film: it is beautifully shot, there is a wonderful atmosphere, it is restful - you can get carried along with the film with your imagination and drift away."

            "This is a first film, but you would hardly know it.",
            "Inventively structured, the documentary alternates between her early adulthood and her final months, her sad demise casting a shadow over the story and giving the film an air of classical tragedy.",
            "God Knows Where I Am probes with curiosity and concern, but it results in very little fresh insight that might allow us to feel that Linda Bishop didn't die in vain.",
            "There are parallels with Carol Morley's exquisite, elusive Dreams of a Life. While this is a more conventional piece of film-making, it leaves us haunted by the same questions -- how a society can fail its most vulnerable members so completely.",
            "This documentary is a lyrical exploration of both a person and the place she died in, as well as a devastating commentary on American society's approach to mental health.",
            "They're using the pacing and the lachrymose visuals to get us inside Linda's head, giving us a sense of how she saw the world as it closed in on her: the loneliness, the ever-slowing pace of a life ebbing.",
            "An empathetic focus on the last days of a woman lost within herself.",
            "Had [Linda] Bishop been able to put a question mark at the end of that sentence, she might be alive today.",
            "Above all, it's a very human story and a very well-told one -- which, in the end, makes it very hard to forget.",
            "The full story is one of unending edge-of-your-seat shock.",
            "Emotionally devastating, intimate and haunting, but not insightful enough.",
            "A meditative, enormously sad, and sometimes angry-making portrait; provides a stark peek into a mind mentally ill yet remarkably confident and determined.",
            "This is great cinema and certainly a contender for one of the best documentaries of the new millennium.",
            "God Knows Where I Am will leave you contemplating those you've ignored on street corners.",
            "Although God Knows Where I Am deserves praise for bringing little-publicized issues to public attention, there doesn't seem to be enough fire here to bring change.",
            "A disturbing documentary on the plight of a mentally ill American woman.",
            "The film gradually thaws out the stark, frozen mystery at its heart, but the warm-blooded, breathing truth of Linda's life is no less tragic than that of her cold death.",
            "This documentary, coupled with Ms. Aviv's article, addresses unresolved issues of personal autonomy versus a patient's inability to protect herself. It will haunt you.",
            "It would have been easy for the film to approach its advocacy role through sensationalism. But the film comes from an altogether more inspired and intimate perspective. ",

            "Beautiful, evocative, and ultimately heartbreaking.",

            "All These Sleepless Nights is a stream-of-consciousness ode to the beautiful and terrifying instability of an unformed youth. It's also a paean to an Old World city that haltingly begins to open its doors to the 21st century.",
            "Michal Marczak's unclassifiable wonder is the movie that Terrence Malick was trying to manufacture with Song to Song.",
            "The nagging question is whether or not the film stands tall on aesthetic or moral grounds, divorced of its purpose as a conversation piece.",

            "The film should stir something true in the chest of anyone who ever was lucky enough to run free in their youth, even if only for a night.",
            "The film is essentially a series of journal entries, but one which shows the ephemeral nature of youthful abandon and the value of the adage \"a weekend wasted is never a weekend wasted\"."

            "Happy Death Day isn't particularly scary, and clearly isn't meant to be - the pleasure lies in the games it plays with its basic storyline, along the way tossing in enough offbeat humour and whodunnit twists to keep us entertained.",
            "If you can't enjoy [Happy Death Day], give up on film.",
            "On another level, Happy Death Day is a low-key celebration of cinema. Landon and Lobdell revel in how their story could only happen in the movies, piling on preposterous complications with self-aware glee.",
            "One of the most breezily enjoyable teen movies of recent years.",
            "Landon's scary movie offers a short, sharp shock to the system. Let it make your day.",
            "The whole thing is basically Gossip Girl as seen through the lens of Nietzsche's theory of eternal recurrence, only not as fun as that sounds.",
            "I love the B-movie production design, subdued score, and overall energy of the film.",
            "If it simply presented itself as a comedy without any scenes played for actual scares, it could have sharpened both its college satire and genre parody.",

            "Good, not great, but some times good is enough.",
            "It's a concept that we've seen before, but with a twist, good direction and some excellent character development. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Yes, Happy Death Day is just Groundhog Day meets...well...every college-set slasher movie you can name. The thing is, though, that is a simple, brush-off description to what turns out to be a surprisingly entertaining little horror film.",
            "Happy Death Day is an inventive, violently smart movie that will renew your love for slashers.",
            "A breezy, peppy, gore-lite affair that survives mostly on the strength of its own sense of humour.",
            "Happy Death Day is a slasher flick that oozes charm, humour and surprisingly little blood and gore. It's like Mean Girls meets Scream meets Groundhog Day.",
            "[Happy Death Day] has a very indolent and superficial perception of what it's like to be a young woman at college. [February 1, 2018]",
            "Despite all the failures, the experience of surrendering to the empty and imperfect pleasures of 'Happy Death Day' is far from unsatisfactory. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Derives a fair amount of mileage out of its canny premise.",
            "A certified Tuesday night time-waster whenever it finally makes it to Netflix.",

            "An act of cinematic sadism, a mean-spirited, self-satisfied piece of teeny-bopper schlock that attempts to clothe its snickering immaturity in a half-baked moral.",

            "The low-budget effort from Vancouver writer-director Scooter Corkle is earnest and methodical, with a tone-setting murkiness to it.",
            "Corkle has amply demonstrated his strengths as a filmmaker, in crafting a noir-ish tale with a few well-placed twists and in assembling a solid cast bolstered by an engaging lead.",
            "A well-told story, with a strong sense of place.",
            "Hollow in the Land traffics in familiar rural thriller territory. But it features an excellent performance from its lead actress and a strong atmosphere of moody tension courtesy of its writer/director.",
            "It's a rough neck Shakespearean tragedy that makes for a fine showcase for [Dianna] Agron, and proves a sharp directorial debut for filmmaker [Scooter] Corkle.",
            "The movie mirrors Alison's desperation through dimly lit dead-end clues and hectic chase sequences through town.",
            "What could have been a beautiful mess, a work of pure chaos and absurdity in its strange choices that never come together, is instead dull, feeling overlong despite its incredibly reasonable 92 minute runtime.",
            "It's just outlandishly twisty.",
            "You have to be a really talented storyteller to pull this off, and Hollow In The Land suggests that Corkle has a ways to go on that account.",
            "Where Hollow in the Land falters is when it trades emotional depth for commercial action thrills. The film's second half seems to have been invaded by a cop-show parasite.",
            "Corkle captures a welcome intensity to the unfolding drama, and he finds a terrific lead in Dianna Agron.",
            "This gritty low-budget thriller hints at intriguing character-driven issues beneath the surface that are compromised by formulaic plotting.",
            "The stench of needlessly convoluted derivativeness lingers throughout this flick.",
            "[A] skillfully plotted debut feature."

            "Wolf Warrior 2 is even bigger and bolder than its predecessor, which doesn't always work in its favor. But genre fans will definitely relish the near constant barrage of elaborate set pieces that are choreographed and filmed for maximum impact.",
            "While \"Wolf Warrior 2\" is blandly generic more often than not, there's something bracing about its patriotic fervor, which asserts that the Chinese will act in the best interests of the world's downtrodden, while the rest of the world just exploits them.",
            "Wolf Warrior 2 is a gargantuan box office phenomenon that most westerners will never even hear about. And I love that part of this story. I just wish Wolf Warrior 2 were a better movie to back up that exciting box office.",
            "Wolf Warrior 2 is an improvement over its predecessor that provides the requisite thrills and action. But its sheer moral ineptitude combined with its throwback B-movie tone makes it one of the most unintentionally hilarious films of the year.",

            "Issues are minor in comparison to what it gets right, and what it gets right is the action... the occasionally brutal, frequently ridiculous, always entertaining action."

            "I'm still unsure if We Are the Flesh is a true post-apocalyptic tale or an alcohol-fueled dream. It could seriously go either way.",
            "A nightmarish mixture of community, acceptance of primitive nature, and the results of extreme isolation, We are the flesh is an unforgettable piece of Mexican horror.",

            "I'll be chewing on this one for a long time.",

            "A tenderly observed, remarkably insightful keeper. No joke.",

            "It's hard to root for a protagonist who is focused only on his own narrow needs and seems indifferent to the broader issues his tale raises.",
            "Miles is gay and we know it. His mother knows it. And the town knows it - whether they care or not. But that aspect of Miles' life is actually very secondary to the film's main thrust.",
            "Though its lead character may feel trapped by his surroundings, \"Miles\" finds inspiration in them, itself something to celebrate, but even more so when it's conveyed as jubilantly as Adloff does here.",

            "Red Christmas is solely for those horror fans who enjoy cheap, CHEAP thrills and low budget fodder (and hopefully a ton of spiked eggnog).",
            "Craig Anderson doesn't always hit the marks he's aiming for, but he certainly gives his distinctive brand of seasonal, blood-splashed mayhem a spirited try.",
            "Craig Anderson's Red Christmas is more Bob Clark's Black Christmas than Michael Curtiz's White Christmas.",

            "No interaction here feels staged or false, though the film itself is often strikingly composed.",
            "Amman Abbasi isn't confident enough to let this detailed environment pull its own weight, and the film ultimately leans on overwrought metaphors and contrived plot hijinks to make sense of itself. ",
            "The diffuse filmmaking style muffles the story's power.",
            "Abbasi has elicited outstanding performances from his entirely-amateur cast, who infuse both authenticity and professionalism into their roles. And it's impossible to remain unmoved by the many contrasts he carefully arranges.",
            "Luckily, Dayveon is worth every penny. Quiet and powerful, it's a film that takes a familiar story and makes it feel new. So, take the risk. You won't regret it.",
            "[Director] Amman Abbasi ... pulls no punches in his evocation of hopelessness and despair amongst this particular African-American community in the Deep South.",
            "A story that doesn't quite live up to its spirit filled images and lofty vision, but will sting no matter what? Lay off the honey, this writer says to himself.",
            "It's only in Dayveon's final act that plot contrivances begin to wander away from Abbasi's carefully calibrated realism.",
            "A slow-burning, atmospheric drama. One of the most mesmerizing and haunting American films since Beasts of the Southern Wild.",
            "... offers a raw yet sincere portrait of adolescence, with a firm grasp on its characters and setting.",
            "By displacing some familiar gang-movie dynamics into an environment less often glimpsed on film, Abbasi stays true to the offbeat heart of his influences.",
            "A coming of age tale of a 13-year-old African American living in rural Arkansas that captures the boy's heartaches and urges, though English subtitles would make the picture more accessible.",
            "Abbasi transplants hood movie tropes to the Deep South, infusing the bucolic settings with junkyard lyricism.",
            "An experiential coming of age tale very much anchored to its surroundings.",
            "Abbasi fights against ... cliches with an atmospheric, immersive evocation of rural Arkansas and an emphasis on closely observed lives rather than narrative drive.",
            "Dayveon stands out with its vision, regional flavor and overall personality.",
            "This film, for all its strengths, is the first work of a young director still trying to gain mastery of his voice. That will come, and it will be fascinating to see what comes next.",
            "\"Dayveon,\" the debut film from Amman Abbasi, acts as a calling card for strong directorial talents that are first displayed here, but are sure flourish even more powerfully in future efforts.",
            "Dayveon's muted, largely allusive storytelling takes a backseat to tone and place throughout, and Abbasi demonstrates an assured command of both.",
            "As the film unfolds, it surprises by mixing casual violence with casual tenderness. ",
            "Abbasi and co-writer Steven Reneau nail the socio-economic factors in this life of crime. ",

            "I was riveted from beginning to end with Molly's Game. It has some of the best performances of the year, it has some of the best writing of the year and it has a true life story that is so vastly strange and unbelievable that it truly has to be witnessed.",

            "Not only is Plummer's performance as J. Paul Getty a thing of dark beauty, All the Money in the World is also one of Scott's strongest films in years.",
            "Williams' performance is the film's key. At face value, it seems too florid for effectiveness; it beguiles you with its delivery and like a heavy mist it completely envelopes you. ",
            "The cynical thriller is based on a catchy true story, but never overwhelms... .",
            "The film's real strength lives in the performances, led by Michelle Williams.",
            "A thriller that works under its own standard and never tries to be more than it is. Michelle Williams is impressive. [Full review in Spanish].",
            "Disappointingly, Plummer's performance is so electrifying that the rest of the film can't compete."
