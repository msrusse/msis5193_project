            "The quickest, zappiest two and a half hours of entertainment you'll ever see.",
            "The Harry Potter movies are the rare series to defy the notion that the books are always better. ",
            "It's always thrilling to see kids taking matters into their own hands, outthinking their peers, outwitting adults, and defeating superior enemies.",
            "Does a magnificent job in bringing to life the unique world of magic and fantasy that, until its mega-hyped release, existed only in the imaginations of author J.K. Rowling's devoted readership.",
            "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is truly a tale for all ages that will last for ages. ",
            "Good film directed for a teenage audience in which not only is magic taught but also how stereotypes affect it while the film itself recreates some British stereotypes. [Review in Spanish]",
            "The introduction to Hogwarts and the magic world is very charming and fun.",
            "This is the world-building moment for Harry Potter, and I loved it. It's sweet and endearing...the set-up is so enjoyable to see.",
            "Chris Columbus has created an extraordinarily detailed look that's both fantastic and yet has its own reality - exactly like an English public school, come to think of it, especially in your first term .",
            "Harry Potter's adventures in wizard-land are cozy and comfortable in Chris Columbus' faithful adaptation.",
            "This faithful rendition of the inaugural Potter book demonstrates that the franchise is in safe, sensible hands.",
            "A surprisingly excellent exciting fantasy flick...",
            " Slow, but it establishes the myth, the cast and the look. And it's holding up surprisingly well.",
            "Although it suffers nominally from being over-stuffed and under-paced, it's grand and involving, with magnificent production design and special effects, and some fabulous thesps present and correct.",
            "a fantastic beginning",
            "Robbie Coltrane, Richard Harris, Zoe Wanamaker and Maggie Smith, to name but a few, all put in an appearance and it is these old hands who are the best aspect of the film.",
            "Suffering from too much fantasy over too little reality, Sorcerer's Stone sets Harry Potter up for a longer and fruitful career as a screen legend.",
            "Because the film is so glossy, so flippant in its presentation of the world that author J.K. Rowling has spent her sizable novels dissecting, that I still don't have a good idea what all the fuss is about.",
            "Even though a few of the book's scenes have been cut, fans probably couldn't hope for a better adaptation. It bodes well for the rest of the series, when strong stories start taking precedence over set-up."

            "No tension, no rhythm and no sense of purpose ... unless you count helping \"Faces of Death\" fans feel more evolved.",
            "The story line of Hannibal is far less interesting than Silence of the Lambs and lacks the emotional subtlety of its predecessor. However, Hannibal is visually and aurally sumptuous, powered by Hans Zimmer's lovely score and brimming with flashy imagery.",
            "The weight-watchers script sensibly dispenses with several characters to serve a brew that's enjoyably spicy but low on substance.",
            "Hannibal Lecter is the ostensible cannibal of this franchise, but the real cannibals are his creators. I wouldn't be surprised if the next time, they have him endorsing his favorite Chianti.",
            "So many characters suffer such ghastly things, yet none of it seems to matter much.",
            "Scott does justice to The Silence of the Lambs and the character of Hannibal in general, even without a few key pieces, and despite toning Harris's novel down plenty.",
            "Part of the appeal of the Hannibal Lecter novels and films is the complexity of the principal character, who is at once a reprehensible murderer and a moral force for justice. ",
            "Thoroughly distasteful. Not for kids.",
            "Doesn't work as its own individual, self-contained cinematic entity.",
            "A dark and complexly entertaining ride, highly generous to multiple viewings.",
            "The near-impossible taks and insurmountable problems have been handled by Scott in a proficient if unexciting way. Aware that he can't possibly meet viewers' expectations, Scott has made a different film, more florid, baroque, and tongue-in-cheek.",
            "Scott's elegant, shadowy atmosphere and deliberate pacing make the film a delightfully spooky experience.",
            "There are moments of a good movie buried amongst this over the top thriller. But these moments are all too rare.",
            "Pork chops get even!",
            "Hannibal doesn't grip the audience with the macabre wit and pervasive sense of impending evil of its predecessor",
            "Where the book kept you wondering and marvelling at the intricacies of the human mind and heart, the film has a sour, smart-alecky conclusion which highlights (what else?) the gore.",
            "Perhaps Scott should have rented out Se7en before he yelled 'action' - the best horror is often what you don't see.",
            "Director Scott has used his considerable talent to dress up this film into an artful, visually impressive affair.",
            "Minus all the mystique of Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal has a few interesting scenes, but fails in equal portion.",
            "Hannibal is not quite what I'd call a 'good' movie, but it could so easily have been worse in countless ways that I'm more than satisfied by the way it turned out."

            "Hearts feels more like a puzzle whose pieces don't fit together and whose picture, were it to be properly assembled, signifies nothing.",
            "The film has a lot of nice little touches going for it, and while there are the obligatory moments of heartstring plucking underscored by the stir of violins, it never really overdoes things. The only problem is, it's just been so done already.",
            "You'll still come away from Hearts in Atlantis wanting to read the book, but had Hicks and Goldman got it right, you would've run straight from the cinema to buy it.",

            "Mira Nair's most colorful and most fully realized film",
            "Not content to merely direct traffic of intersecting characters, Mira Nair never lets the scurrying ensemble lag or their stories flag. \"Monsoon Wedding\" is one of the most culturally savory, joyously exotic comedies since \"Strictly Ballroom.\"",

            "An optimistic and luscious film.",
            "The impression of cosmopolitan modern India, of diaspora lives thrown into collision and collusion, is engaging in itself, but the emotional optimism here is the most heartening aspect of this vivacious film.",
            "Um filme alegre, colorido e fascinante.",
            "The romantic comedy even goes into somber territory, but it never loses its grasp of tone or its undenying beauty.",

            "An unfortunate hybrid of Oedipal and Peter Pan complexes, Singleton's film is a mishmash of half-cocked ideas and unrealized sentiments.",

            "Never rises above the level of a soap opera.",
            "With a combination of sensitivity and insight, John Singleton presents a fascinating portrait of an African American that goes against stereotypes of 20-year-old men."

            "The result is one of the most successful attempts to make math look sexy, even if the movie strays - gallops, really - from the details of the actual life of Nobel Prize-winner John Forbes Nash Jr.",
            "Its inspirational qualities to read more about the real John Nash (and all the things omitted from this biopic) might be the only lasting effect.",

            "Profoundly, exhaustingly mediocre, a fussily overdone bit of mindless prestige filmmaking.",
            "Granted, it's uplifting to see mental illness portrayed on the screen in a humane fashion and world-class intellectuals elevated to heroic status. But A Beautiful Mind feels contrived from beginning to end, a paint-by-the-numbers biography.",

            "The second, idealised, sentimentalised half of the film is torture, as we plod through the routine I'm-here-to-help psychiatrist, the walls plastered with cut-up newspapers and the what-happens-when-he-stops-taking-the-medicine stuff.",
            "The story also comes up with a clever way for Nash to fight his problem: He uses his mind. His illness is a puzzle, after all, and he's good at figuring out puzzles. You'll root for him.",
            "Despite problems of structure and tone, and some crucial omissions from Nash's actual life, A Beautiful Mind has emerged as one of the season's most enjoyable and popular films.",

            "One of the most honored and most expertly articulated Mexican films of recent years.",
            "Recalling Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction - but edgier than both - this is a hell of a first film. For all its bonecrunching savagery, it's also a fundamentally moral work.",
            "It's good and good-looking and features one of the best soundtracks in years ... but it's also slick and schematic, weak on feeling and overly indebted to Tarantino.",
            "Inarritu's talent may be derivative, but it's applied to a setting he knows well and whose vibrancy he's keen to convey.",
            "A debut in the industry that feels relevant after all these years. This is an epic story of power, poverty, love and guilt. [Full review in Spanish].",
            "It's a breath of fresh air in an industry more accustomed to older narrative and pictorial styles.",
            "Very few films create, as this one succeeds in doing, a fresh and individual sense of a complete world, and allow us to experience this sense as if it were our own.",
            "[Inarritu's] triumph - helped by a cast of unknown actors who more than meet the standards of Hollywood venismo - is to give so lurid a sequence of events the force of reality; and make a story of relentless bleakness, oddly uplifting.",
            "... an invigorating film filled with vivid performances, haunting scenes, and messy, intense emotions, a violent portrait of modern day Mexico City grounded in frustration, helplessness, and messy, intense emotions.",
            "Gripping but gory subtitled drama isn't for the squeamish. ",
            "Screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga and director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu exert such control over the story that even a cute doggie disappearance develops into a toilet-trained take on \"The Telltale Heart.\" Warts and all, \"Amores Perros\" is love, actually.",
            "Dozens of shoddy imitators have done nothing to disguise the wit of its narrative construction.",
            "... it is a hyperviolent movie against violence; a graphic portrayal of infidelity in the name of marriage; a tale of murderous sibling rivalry in the name of family.",
            "Amores Perros signals the bold, audacious, fiercely human and ultra-violent feature directorial debut of Inarritu, a gifted Mexican director bound to make a mark on international cinema.",
            "Gonzalez Inarritu's sinfully enjoyable epic roars in on a wave of blood, gunshots and dog barks.",
            "It is that rarest of features that shows a deep understanding of people, truly cinematic storytelling technique and brilliantly choreographed fight and chase scenes.",
            "A harrowing, powerful and often disturbing movie about three seemingly unrelated stories that collide after one horrific car accident in Mexico City.",
            "Seemingly uneven, Questionably overlong, Indisputably intriguing",
            "It is a raw, intermittently brilliant film that heralds a sort of renaissance in Mexican film.",
            "Astonishingly powerful debut film from director Inarritu - brilliantly shot, superbly acted and deeply heartfelt, this is one of the best films of the year.",
            "A good and extremely ambitious first effort."

            "Few outside of Coen cliques paid this nihilistic neo-noir much attention. Perhaps that's its wryest, slyest punchline: To watch Ed Crane is to largely forget him and, upon returning to him, revisit the pleasure of meeting him for the first time.",

            "The story is never boring, but it's never exciting, harrowing, or hilarious, either",
            "It's undeniably a melodrama, but there's enough real emotion lurking beneath the manipulative tear jerking to make the movie a worthwhile and occasionally genuinely moving experience.",
            "A movie that speaks the universal language of schmaltz."

            "Finely crafted but more than a little overrated.",

            "Its overall attempts at re-igniting the unsettling ambience of old-fashioned film noir are let down by a potholed plot and poor characterisation.",

            "This film is more didactic and less cinematic than I might like, but Makhmalbaf speaks from the heart and the film should be judged accordingly.",
            "Both a fine example of the striking work being done by contemporary Iranian filmmakers and a near-documentary testament to the painful modern history of Afghanistan.",

            "The greatest distinction of \"Ghost World\" is its singular spirit. Here's a dark, deadpan comedy about alienated kids that manages to be smart, surpassingly odd, extremely funny and mysteriously endearing at the same time.",
            "See it for Birch's hostile stare and Johansson's devastating monotone.",
            "Most of Ghost World is funny, but the laughs are inextricably tied to the painful alienation and self-loathing that comes with living on society's fringes.",
            "By sharp turns poignant, disturbing and hysterically funny.",
            "his is 'teen comedy' of startling sophistication -- with horribly funny bits as well. A true original, with sharp humour, subtle detail and painfully realistic characters.",
            "It isn't a perfect film, but it's never less than strikingly original.",
            "Zwigoff's portrait of adolescent alienation commands a potent portrait of interiority as concerns its lonely souls searching for likeminded personalities within a superficial void. ",
            "An elegy to the rebellious Gen X dream, and a crash course in existence for all 18-year-olds who followed.",
            "We care about these characters and, despite themselves, they care for one another, too. Irony meets empathy here and both are better for it.",
            "That is part of its magic and its beauty, I think - its ability to speak to and for those who don't quite feel at home in mainstream society. ",
            "A blend of old and new leaves the film with a timeless feel, one that emphasizes that no matter what significant changes society undergoes people are pretty much the same.",
            "Ghost World is animated by a tension between Seymour's 78 rpm universe and Enid's dedication to a punk etho",
            "Ghost World is very funny but also very perceptive, and it offers Steve Buscemi one of the defining roles of his career.",
            "While this isn't a showy or flashy movie, it has social, psychological, and ultimately mystical overtones that raise it leagues above most other teen-centered comedies.",
            "The modest yet redeeming triumph of Ghost World is the offhand way it brings to the screen a streak of American dark humor that is dour, resilient and unexpectedly infectious.",
            "A top draw adaptation of a cracking comic-book.",
            "Like \"Rushmore\" with a female slant, \"Ghost World\" tackles the true torches we often keep to ourselves as well as the struggle of feeling like a specter, or, as Enid says, as though \"everyone's too stupid to realize you.\"",
            "...satisfying in ways that more than compensate for the film's soft ending.",
            "Has some grade A talent behind it, but it lacks any of the heart or emotion of the coming of age brand the film aspires toward...",
            "If more people appreciated stories like this, movies and comic books would be better off.",
            "Anyone who grew up in the suburbs or ever felt out of place will find something to relate to in this film.",
            "Based on Clowes' underground comic book, this is a tale of how the mediocrity of American subsurbs can suffocate its creative denizens, all misfits of course; it's extremely well acted by Steve Buscemi and Thora Birch.",
            "Zwigoff makes Enid's neighborhood a truly strange and haunted place, where plastic people robotically follow their society's norms, and those who resist are left angry, alienated, and without any ideas for how to survive.",
            "Like its heroine, Ghost World dares to drop its defenses, deepening as it shifts from evoking sympathy for the judgmental misanthrope to saluting the bravery of those who find beauty in others' flaws."

            "Vaughn hits the bullseye as a strident, volatile jerk who can't keep his mouth shut. You never really like him, but you can't wait to see what he'll do next -- his missteps and offenses are so unbelievable you wince, but you can't look away.",
            "The same offbeat sensibility that informed Swingers is also evident here, except that unlike the 1996 film, which dealt with real issues, Favreau's new crime-comedy is plotless",
            "A picture that may not end up with the fervent following of its flashier predecessor, but one that merits a viewing.",
            "Swingers fans beware.",
            "The film isn't as clever as Swingers but it boasts enough witty dialogue to make it entertaining.",
            "The plot seems to be nothing more than a translucent bridge to the next scene where Vaughn can run his mouth and Favreau can play off him as the longsuffering friend",
            "As with 'Swingers' before it, the sparkling chemistry between Favreau and Vaughn is undoubtedly the highlight of 'Made'.",
            "Well-written and well-acted, though your enjoyment will largely depend on how high your Vince Vaughn tolerance level is.",
            "The script is nicely seasoned with jokes and surprise twists (right up to a contrived sentimental ending), and the two lead actors plunge into their roles with contagious enthusiasm.",
            "As witty as Favreau's dialogue is and as engaging as the look and tone he gives the film are, I think what's most admirable is how generous he is with his cast.",
            "Made should be much funnier than it is, although I enjoyed the permanent fizzing of its humour on an internal level.",
            "There's a not-so-subtle attempt at rekindling the charisma Favreau and Vaughn showed in Swingers, and for the most part the effort succeeds.",
            "Most amazing is that Favreau not only keeps things hilarious even at their darkest, but he plays it all for keeps. There's not a \"hip\" or glib moment in the whole picture.",
            "Doesn't know when to step on the brakes before it turns itself in to a one-note shtick movie.",
            "Favreau and Vaughn retain the ad-libbed give-and-take that sparkled in \"Swingers.\"",
            "The natural rhythms of the (largely improvised) script create characters and situations that are authentic, hilarious and engaging."

            "What distinguishes The Anniversary Party from the movies/lives that inspired it is the dead-on quality of much of the writing and acting.",
            "As first film, it suffers from problems of most movies directed by actors: Big emotional scenes and indulgent acting, but it has some moments of truth",
            "...because Cumming and Leigh avoid most (though not all) of the easy choices common to first-time writers and directors, the movie stays on the right side of entertaining.",

            "I now find Cruise tolerable only when he's in a movie that undercuts or ridicules his narcissism--as Eyes Wide Shut did and as this movie does even more noticeably. ",
            "Vanilla Sky is nearly identical to the 1997 Spanish film it's based on, except it's set in Manhattan instead of Madrid and has a much better soundtrack.",
            "Some surface appeal, but ultimately vacant.",
            "The real mystery here is why a filmmaker as talented and unique as Crowe would want to devote several years of his life to recreating someone else's movie.",
            "Vanilla Sky is one of the most challenging films of the year. It is thought provoking, mysterious, complex, nerve racking, beautiful, creepy, funny and a trip deliriously all its own.",
            "A riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma. The problem is, the mystery and the enigma are in one movie, and the riddle&#8217;s in an entirely different movie.",
            "Crowe's baby-boomer fantasy tinkles with notions like a jostled perfume counter.",
            "This isn't a typically dumbed-down rehash and, as such, it dissatisfied the rank and file of multiplex moviegoers but earned the appreciation of adventurous film fans.",
            "Crowe asks the viewer to absorb this more viscerally than intellectually; how much one enjoys (or even accepts) the experience will likely depend on the extent to which one is willing to do so. ",
            "Cameron Crowe's vinyl-collector version of \"Jacob's Ladder\" is a daring gamble paying off even when ambition exceeds his grasp. The subconscious can boil over with too much pop culture poured in. Keep that in mind, and it will have you at \"What the hell?\"",
            "Two and a half hours I'll never get back...",
            "It just makes things easier to believe that good-looking rich folks are just as miserable and unhappy as the rest of us . . .",
            "This is a whole new palette for Crowe, and his excitement rubs off on us.",
            "A classic case of what happens when a Hollywood studio and a star (Cruise) take a Spanish metaphysical thriller and turn it into a glossy, overproduced big-budget star vehicle that lacks distinct identity.",
            "Vanilla Sky turns out to be a rousing, exhilarating entertainment, thanks mostly to Cruise's balls-to-the-wall performance.",
            "My suggestion is to avoid this film and instead rent Open Your Eyes (Abre Los Ojos) the film upon which Vanilla Sky was based.",
            "Vanilla Sky is a long, complex, ambitious thriller that doesn't quite work.",

            "An intriguing and visually impressive film squarely aimed at the art house crowd.",
            "For a movie heralded as the cutting edge of visual innovation, Waking Life is disappointingly dull in every other respect.",
            "Linklater and his animation collaborators have clearly had a lot of fun, morphing characters into their own conversational subjects, destabilizing their environs, throwing the material world into question.",
            "It is a dream -or rather a series of waking dreams that slip into one another like those Russian dolls. It also takes computer animation in a new direction.",

            "a commercial ripoff designed to confuse art-house patrons",
            "A far-out-man poetry slam, art exhibit and imaginative philosophical discourse all at once drifts gently down a stream of consciousness until merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, \"Waking Life\" is but a dream. Who says existential fiction must be dreary?",
            "A brilliant film that provokes thought, idea, and conversations within the audience through its surreal animation and incredibly profound conversations. ",
            "Form and content fit perfectly: even if the highbrow babbling gets a bit much, the hypnotic animation means that there is always something to watch, like characters suddenly dissolving into smoke or spectacles expanding.",
            "A true independent film that uses animation techniques to their utmost.",
            "The question comes up often in life: What's your favorite movie? Since October 2001, the answer has been easy and one I shoot back reflexively almost before someone's finished the question: \"Waking Life.\"",
            "The novelty of the much-lauded animation style wears off about halfway through, with the end result a film that's more interminable than anything else.",
            "It is not the best film of the year, nor is it likely to be one that I purchase and watch often. Still, it is something that should be seen by everyone and experienced by any diehard film lover.",
            "I applaud Linklater for [directing] such an interesting ride. But it suffers from a lack of sensistivity to its audience...",

            "Defines itself through sustained mood, otherworldly intrigue and deep, abiding humanism.",
            "Kelly is a supple and courageous storyteller, boldly free-associating as he mixes parody and satire with earnest psychodrama and coming up with plot points no one could anticipate.",
            "Donnie Darko has plenty of problems. But most stem from a young filmmaker overswinging on his first time up to the plate and hitting a deep fly out rather than a home run.",
            "A mini-masterpiece that marks the arrival of brave new talents in Gyllenhaal and Kelly. Cult glory beckons.",
            "An unnerving, electrifying debut film from 26-year-old writer/director Kelly, one that elucidates the universal traumas of growing up, but does so with a startling uncommonness.",
            "Every ounce of creativity is met with an equal serving of disappointing nebulousness.",
            "It's a dense, complicated and amazing amalgam of genres and influences that really defies any constraints.",
            "I certainly didn't have an emotional bond with the film. Still, I admire the risk taking and what it has to say about mental illness.",
            "It's ultimately the piece's surprisingly sincere, compassionate edge which transmits the most.",
            "[Richard] Kelly winds so many ideas, so many questions, and so much marvelously strange experience through this ambitious film that you can forgive the few loose ends and overdone caricatures amidst the richness.",
            "The theatrical version is some kind of compacted masterpiece, hormonal, vital, dazed, blissfully unhinged... I'm too attached to Donnie Darko to worry over its wanton weirdness, its mix of concreteness and intangibility.",
            "It remains an aesthetically filmed blend of off-beat comedy, mind-boggling sci-fi, and subjective storytelling that serves as a singular and timeless piece of cinema.",
            "Gyllenhaal's breakthrough performance is simultaneously heartfelt, melancholy and mischievous.",
            "As pop as it is arthouse, as funny as it is tragic, Donnie Darko remains a remarkable one-off that's easy to adore.",
            "Complex, inventive, gripping, strange, and in the end deeply moving, with more ideas in it than Hollywood has produced in the entire last decade.",
            "An incredibly fascinating, star-making film that never fails to intrigue.",
            "Donnie Darko is a bit like a teenager: brooding, complex, rebellious, and difficult to comprehend. ",
            "A decidedly weird time-travel drama that puzzled viewers so much that many went back to see it again and again... Unfortunately, Kelly's extended version diminishes the film's impact.",
            "Maybe Richard Kelly's fate is to be the cult-film circuit's Michael Cimino. He has yet to match the mood or magnitude of his debut - a collision of time-travel sci-fi, commentary on '80s malaise and teen angst that's simultaneously witty and poignant.",
            "A brilliant and truly incredible piece of art that deserves to be watched...",
            "The film...asks the question: what if the universe as we live it, not just as we theorize it, really isn't as we imagine it? In making the mundane as bottomless as the cosmic, Donnie Darko has the guts to remain a riddle itself.",
            "The drowsy surrealism and elaborate inconclusiveness of Donnie Darko will simultaneously guarantee it a rabid cult and put it way off limits to the don't-get-its."

            "When Luzhin's old chess teacher shows up, the movie becomes a slow-motion wreck.",
            "Turturro supplies some good moments, but without a believable emotional core the film falls short",
            "Vale por completo la pena, y, si gustan del juego ciencia, es una cinta obligada.",
            "More lyrical and affecting than the stiffly contrived A Beautiful Mind. Profoundly in touch with the miracle and curse of a fragile, fanatical artistic sensibility.",

            "Further proof that director Marleen Gorris ... can't shape a scene.",
            "While [Turturro] certainly nails the bizarre outer manifestations of Luzhin's eccentricity, he never makes us care.",
            "The chess scenes, especially toward the end, are filmed with an attempted frenzy that borders on laughable.",
            "There are very real pleasures to be had.",
            "\"A sedate, simplistic, dispiriting film about chess and madness. 'Searching for Bobby Fischer' is better.\"",
            "Capable but not transporting, never unraveling the mystery of its hero's genius or, worse, making us care enough to look deeper.",
            "Turturro's stormy and quirky performance is the ... highlight of a film that makes all the familiar chess moves.",
            "Pretty much just a string of words and ideas and stick-figure characters who never become fully formed.",
            "The film is a letdown, alas, almost squandering all the fine acting and lovely scenery.",
            "If The Luzhin Defence falls short of being totally absorbing and compelling, it's surely because it's so difficult to translate Nabokov's view that we are all pawns in the big game.",
            "The film is sedate and cerebral. Still, Gorris manages to impart a sense of the subtlety of chess and even to inject some suspense into the matches."

            "challenging and uncompromised, and Solondz makes his point and punches it home",

            "Seldom has the elegant past of 18th century royal life married modern filmmaking with the grace and sophistication of Eric Rohmer's L'anglaise et le duc.",
            "Nothing short of a technical marvel and a ravishing movie to look at.",
            "Whenever the subtleties of political morality get a bit overbearing, there's a respite in the painterly streets of Paris, where, we are reminded, the past was another city, strange and resistant to present-day adornments.",
            "I loved the look of this film.",
            "A bold (and lovely) experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams.",
            "Though not one of Rohmer best films, it's worth seeing for the acting and the dialogue which magnify the glory of the French language. Amazingly, at 81, Rohmer continues to be productive; rejection of film by Cannes Festival stirred controversy in 2001",
            "Who would have thought that in the year of Spider-Man and Attack of the Clones, the year's most innovative use of special effects would come in a film about the French Revolution?",
            "Rohmer's playful style is often good fun. And Russell is especially compelling. But honestly, it's fairly hard going.",
            "At 135-minutes, this stream-of-facts lecture trembles into the trenches of monotony without the detraction of technology.",
            "My problem with The Lady and the Duke is not Rohmer's ostensibly pro-Royalist politics, but his now reactionary aesthetics.",
            "Rohmer's novel, exhilarating and elegant work with painted scenery and digital equipment is a revelation. But this work is stuck in a film in which the foreground action is sleep-inducing by comparison.",
            "Not only has Rohmer reinvented the costume drama with The Lady and the Duke, he makes the case that the genre is worth reinventing.",
            "Rohmer makes a gracious, if occasionally tedious, effort to dress the French Revolution in digitally rendered scenes that bespeak the period perfectly.",
            "To the vast majority of more casual filmgoers, it will probably be a talky bore.",
            "Watching The Lady And The Duke is like looking at a really fine play.",
            "Working from Elliott's memoir, Rohmer fashions the sort of delicate, articulate character- and- relationship study he's favored for decades.",
            "The Lady and the Duke is a smart, romantic drama that dares to depict the French Revolution from the aristocrats' perspective.",
            "As visually arresting as it is distractingly odd",
            "Despite the film's shortcomings, it's still a solid effort and a thought-provoking look at idealism gone wrong.",
            "An instance of an old dog not only learning but inventing a remarkable new trick."

            "August ... steers this story to its stirring conclusion with firm lack of sentimentality.",
            "It may sound like a mere disease-of- the-week TV movie, but A Song For Martin is made infinitely more wrenching by the performances of real-life spouses Seldahl and Wollter.",
            "Full of unforgiving irony and quiet realism, A Song for Martin stands as a powerful and moving achievement.",
            "More honest about Alzheimer's disease, I think, than Iris.",
            "Viveka Seldahl and Sven Wollter will touch you to the core in a film you will never forget -- that you should never forget.",
            "The movie, for all its sincerity, becomes clinical and repetitious, though its unsparing vision of the fragility of identity can give you a shudder.",
            "Upsetting and thought-provoking, the film has an odd purity that doesn't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them.",
            "It's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead.",
            "Director-writer Bille August ... depicts this relationship with economical grace, letting his superb actors convey Martin's deterioration and Barbara's sadness -- and, occasionally, anger.",
            "Martin and Barbara are complex characters -- sometimes tender, sometimes angry -- and the delicate performances by Sven Wollter and Viveka Seldahl make their hopes and frustrations vivid.",
            "A delightfully simple, splendid love story between two older people ... a journey of life and love you won't want to miss.",
            "An extraordinary Swedish film about the soul adventure of marriage -- the kind of intimate and character-driven film that Bille August does best.",
            "This slow-moving Swedish film offers not even a hint of joy, preferring to focus on the humiliation of Martin as he defecates in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party.",
            "A touching examination of the ravages of Alzheimer's disease.",
            "Mr. Wollter and Ms. Seldhal give strong and convincing performances, but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion, grief and fear.",
            "An almost unbearably morbid love story.",
            "Seldahl's Barbara is a precise and moving portrait of someone whose world is turned upside down, first by passion and then by illness.",
            "Painful to watch, but viewers willing to take a chance will be rewarded with two of the year's most accomplished and riveting film performances.",
            "A wrenching film about a romance between two people in their fifties, shattered when one becomes the victim of Alzheimer's disease.",
            "August -- a pupil of Ingmar Bergman's -- manages to tell a tragic tale while avoiding the heavy-laden angst of a Bergman film.",
            "Often gruelling and heartbreaking to witness, but Seldahl and Wollter's sterling performances raise this far above the level of the usual maudlin disease movie."

            "A heavy-handed and preachy film."

            "Black Hawk Down makes that point without preachment, in precise and pitiless imagery. And for that reason alone it takes its place on the very short list of the unforgettable movies about war and its ineradicable and immeasurable costs.",
            "A relentless immersion in combat strikingly realized but none too pleasurable to sit through.",
            "Ambitious, sumptuously-framed and frenetic, Black Hawk Down occasionally errs on the confused, but is nonetheless a rare find of a war movie which dares to turn genre convention on its head.",
            "[Scott] does a reasonable job sketching the complicated and contradictory political context, but attempts to bring in the odd Somali perspective are grossly inadequate.",
            "Has the pointless verisimilitude of an expensively rendered computer simulation.",
            "Not nearly as potent as one might expect from this particular director, especially with a sizable budget and resources at his disposal, and governing this impressive cast.",

            "Even in its darkest moments, a heartening defiance underlies gut-wrenching calamity.",
            "The Grey Zone isn't for everyone, but its riveting power constitutes a stunning (as in it leaves you shattered and shaken) achievement.",
            "[Nelson's] movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised, unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes.",
            "Like the Ancient Mariner, Nelson grabs us by the collar and says, You must know about this. You must bear witness. And so you do.",
            "If they gave an Oscar for best ensemble acting, and I think they should, The Grey Zone would get my vote. ",

            "It unsuccessfully tries to bridge the gap between pathos and establishing a sense of realism, coming across as forced. Overweight prisoners and Harvey Keitel's German accent distract from the mood of the film.",

            "Unlike Schindler's List, ... this uses history to remind us of the tenuousness of our own morality, to remind us that ... most of us will never have to know what we might be capable of in certain circumstances.",
            "The effort is sincere and the results are honest, but the film is so bleak that it's hardly watchable.",
            "Hauntingly unforgettable.",
            "An intelligent and deeply felt work about impossible, irrevocable choices and the price of making them.",
            "It's hard to imagine anybody ever being \"in the mood\" to view a movie as harrowing and painful as The Grey Zone, but it's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it's started.",
            "Brings light to a little-known facet of the Holocaust in a way that does justice to its moral ambiguities.",
            "If this story must be told and retold -- and indeed it must -- then The Grey Zone is to be lauded for finding a new and ingenious angle.",
            "Effectively feeds our senses with the chilling sights and sounds from within the camp to create a completely numbing experience.",
            "As bold and unyielding as The Grey Zone stands with its historical subtext, there are a few factors detracting from the powerful message.",
            "The Grey Zone is powerful, mesmerizing and disturbing.",
            "An uncomfortable movie, suffocating and sometimes almost senseless, The Grey Zone does have a center, though a morbid one."

            "All the beauty does not make the film even half as profound as it so obviously strives to be.",

            "It's intriguing, visually arresting and utterly impenetrable!",
            "When a character comments 'too many changes are in the air that lack a means of expression,' one senses that Godard, at 72, is still struggling to communicate those changes through the medium of film.",

            "The best indication of the film's pretentiousness comes from recurrent images of a book with blank pages, as if to point out that Godard has nothing to say, but so what? Let's throw in a few images and people will come anyway.",
            "A ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes.",

            "Even when he's not at his most critically insightful, Godard can still be smarter than any 50 other filmmakers still at work.",

            "It is an Imamura drama as warm as hot spring water. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "This romantic fable, starring again the Eel's central couple, with strong meythical and sexual overtones, represents one of the Japanese master's lightest films.",
            "A sweet and enthusiastic embrace of our biology and chemistry, and a delicious and salacious celebration of sexuality and individuality.",
            "Imamura's embrace of the cental characters' peculiar habits, predilections and appetites is his delicious and salacious way of celebrating their sexuality and individuality.",

            "Warm Water Under a Red Bridge is a quirky and poignant Japanese film that explores the fascinating connections between women, water, nature, and sexuality.",

            "We never feel anything for these characters, and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity.",
            "The characters are interesting and the relationship between Yosuke and Saeko is worth watching as it develops, but there's not enough to the story to fill two hours.",

            "I suspect many viewers will be disoriented and put off by Warm Water Under a Red Bridge, but if you let go and enjoy the ride, you'll find a sly comedy and a clever poem that's worth cherishing.",
            "Japanese director Shohei Imamura's latest film is an odd but ultimately satisfying blend of the sophomoric and the sublime.",
            "A comedy that is warm, inviting, and surprising."

            "If you've the patience, there are great rewards here.",
            "While its careful pace and seemingly opaque story may not satisfy every moviegoer's appetite, the film's final scene is soaringly, transparently moving.",
            "Tsai's confidence in the deep power of silence drives home the film's inner convictions. Its surface works coolly, intriguingly and, happily, feebly in opposition to the heart of the matter.",
            "It's a hilarious conceit, which Tsai carries through with smart cinematic wit.",
            "The film's understated humor and relatable character's steer us towards feelings of compassion and understanding, rather than pity.",
            "Wise and deadpan humorous.",
            "A funny and moving meditation on yearning, mourning and the vagaries of time.",
            "The careful compositions in the Taiwanese What Time Is It There? give us plenty of time to search for meaning and to wonder what the movie is trying to say.",
            "Has moments of quiet power and others of almost slapstick charm, and it's so elegantly fashioned that it's difficult to take one's eyes from the screen.",
            "At times, Tsai's approach makes viewing this film like watching paint dry, but what a sublime design it makes.",
            "Alternates between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking loneliness and isn't afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience.",
            "Mr. Tsai is a very original artist in his medium, and What Time Is It There? should be seen at the very least for its spasms of absurdist humor.",
            "His best film remains his shortest, The Hole, which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive.",
            "Tsai convincingly paints a specifically urban sense of disassociation here.",
            "Inherently caustic and oddly whimsical, the film chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss.",
            "What Time Is It There? is not easy. It haunts you, you can't forget it, you admire its conception and are able to resolve some of the confusions you had while watching it."

            "The violence, in short, remains unseen, but that makes it no easier to bear; what lurks and wails behind a wall is, for Haneke, the most reliable wellspring of dread.",
            "A procession of long virtuoso takes that typically begin and end in the middle of actions or sentences, constituting not only an interactive jigsaw puzzle but a thrilling narrative experiment.",
            "A searing, structurally ingenious look at racial tension on the streets of Paris.",
            "This film, from Austrian director Michael Haneke, is one of the most uncompromisingly difficult and challenging of the year.",
            "All this unrelenting bleakness would be fine if it went someplace interesting, but the film's themes never coalesce into anything beyond basic existential angst.",
            "[Haneke's] socio-political condemnations assume an aggressively hectoring tone.",
            "While its reputation has been overshadowed by later works from the filmmaker, it remains a provocative deconstruction of modern anhedonia.",
            "It's a great entry point to his filmography, serving as a good example of Haneke's visual and thematic style.",
            "Code Unknown is an unusual example of a movie that is socially aware, but that is thankfully equally aware of how tiresome moralising and preaching can be.",
            "If some of the political theorising is somewhat naive and the direction is occasionally manipulative, the acting, particularly from Juliette Binoche, is superb.",
            "Haneke brings his usual dark sensibility to bear on the multifaceted story, expressing the fractured quality of modern city life through scenes that wander through a labyrinth of missing links and lost connections.",
            "With virtually no music and very little expository dialogue, this is one of the rare films with enough faith in moviegoers to let them figure things out for themselves.",
            "A chilling picture of urban disillusionment, Code Unknown's strength is its insistence that, to be realistic, it cannot give easy answers.",
            "The director toys with the entire idea of unlocking the code of violence, the small and individually insignificant elements that add up to tales of either joy or horror.",
            "Michael Haneke's only attempt to be emotionally salient.",
            "Despite the film's Bressonian rigours, its emotional force should finally give the lie to Haneke's reputation as a coldly academic film-maker.",
            "The emotional landscape is observed with detachment; you have to connect the almost hidden dots to empathise with the characters or form the message, and it's hard.",
            "Packed with provocative ideas and fragments of provocative ideas.",
            "Even if it's a bit 'foreign' and arty, it's also consistently gripping, thoughtful, powerful stuff, assembled in an unusual way that catches us off guard and never preaches.",
            "Worthy, challenging, heavily art-house-centric feature that explores ideas of immigration, communication, xenophobia and representations of reality within fiction.",
            "An interesting concept... [but] one doomed by a lack of characterization, Code Unknown remains a jumble of unknowable elements.",

            "Inspired by a supposedly true story by Cassandra De Jesus, this low-key drama is prime Abel Ferrara territory: a New York tale rumbling with irony and ambiguity.",

            "An undeveloped story.",
            "Can't quite deliver the goods, but it still provides a few highs along the way.",
            "Highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast, it's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring Ice-T in a major role.",

            "A macabre and very stylized Swedish fillm about a modern city where all the religious and civic virtues that hold society in place are in tatters.",
            "This is wild surreal stuff, but brilliant and the camera just kind of sits there and lets you look at this and its like you're going from one room to the next and none of them have any relation to the other.",
            "There's really only one good idea in this movie, but the director runs with it and presents it with an unforgettable visual panache.",
            "A valuable and rare movie experience.",

            "Even though we know the outcome, the seesawing of the general's fate in the arguments of competing lawyers has the stomach-knotting suspense of a legal thriller, while the testimony of witnesses lends the film a resonant undertone of tragedy.",

            "Director Robert Gu\u00e9diguian, who wrote the script with Jean-Louis Milesi and co-produced his film, delivers a story that's particularly French but also sadly universal.",
            "This ville is far from tranquille, but the French twist on this emotional powerhouse keeps proceedings meditative as things go into the gutter.",
            "It's got a lot on its plate, and sometimes it overindulges, loses focus and plays too obviously. Still, it manages to remain forceful and moving.",

            "At two hours, this movie seems to drag on and on as the tragedies pile up. I found myself looking at my watch more than I was looking at the screen. If the town were a little more quiet, I would have taken a nap",
            "Recommended only if you like it dreary.",
            "Bach and Chopin form clear cut patterns that underscore the emotionally depressing film ..., but a better choice would have included the impressionistic Debussy",

            "As teen melodrama, well, Carter's film is what it is; but for such a mainstream black-consciousness movie, at least it doesn't shy from addressing some touchy issues about masculinity, parenthood, and black attitudes to whites.",
            "To the film's credit, it tries, and while it never really sings, it does deliver the dance.",
            "A refreshingly friendly view of a romance between people of different pigmentation, an area where more respectable pictures still wimp out.",
            "It's just a pity for the actors and the audience that the theme of conquering one's background, prejudices, and limitations has to be spelled out in block capitals.",
            "Patronising hybrid of a myriad of other teen movies. Don't bother, just watch them instead.",
            "A solid dance-themed movie, with acting of a slightly higher calibre than the genre usually demands.",
            "This movie has sentimental value. But it's way too long, very boring, and the acting is weird, with 35-year-olds playing 19-year-olds.",
            "Ultimately, this talented twosome [Stiles and Thomas] can only do so much with a script that continually lets them down at about every turn.",
            "Performances throughout are solidly decent.",
            "It's not courageous enough to deviate from the teen movie formula more than a smidgeon.",
            "Sara's got a sense of humor about how very uncool she is, and she proves to be a game girl.",
            "Tries to squeeze in a few too many plot elements into too short a time.",
            "Stiles and Thomas redeem this film over and over. And the dancing is fun to watch, too.",
            "Likeable teen romance that overcomes its inevitable predictability thanks to its talented cast and its avoidance of both clich\u00e9s and syrupy sentimentality.",
            "Carter has given us a pleasant enough, if not especially original film.",
            "There are enough respectable social messages here.",
            "If \"Dance\" stumbles into a few too many subplots and a couple of cliched characters along the way, it also makes some strong points about contemporary attitudes toward the idea of interracial romances.",
            "Told with a refreshing lack of sensationalism.",
            "The leads shine and the relationship really grew on me. There's not much more to ask for in a movie like this.",
            "An interracial romance between an aspiring ballerina and a hip hop devotee that sets off sparks within the African American community where they live.",
            "Ballet meets hip-hop in this warmly enjoyable yet unambitious teen romance.",
            "Lo que salva a la pel\u00edcula de ser un fracaso total, son las s\u00f3lidas actuaciones de Stiles y Thomas."

            "One must remember that even a lesser Godard is likely to be much more stimulating than another director's better films.",
            "A pair of set pieces -- the trio dancing in unison in a bar and their famous 9-minute, 43-second run through the Louvre -- make the movie worthwhile alone, but the disjointed, meandering, and somewhat random narrative isn't anything to write home about.",

            "As wearying as the film becomes in its long, bleak sequences, its uniquely cinematic and emotion-charged experience makes the effort worthwhile.",
            "Six years after the 7-1/2-hour Satan's Tango, Magyar maverick Bela Tarr makes a stunning feature return with \"Werckmeister Harmonies,\" another hypnotic meditation on popular demagogy and mental manipulation that's a snap at 145 minutes.",
            "Bela Tarr's style seems to be an attempt to regard his characters with great intensity and respect, to observe them without jostling them, to follow unobtrusively as they move through their worlds, which look so ordinary and are so awesome, like ours.",
            "A chilling, mesmerizing, intense account of ethnic cleansing (in spirit if not in letter) from Hungarian master Bela Tarr.",
            "Over two hours and 20 minutes, not much actually happens, and Tarr creates a mood so lulling that even the rare scenes of dialogue can be hard to follow. But Werckmeister's standout moments are searing like few others in film history.",
            "Weird, wonderful, witty and unsettling.",
            "\"Fantasztikus!\"",
            "Densely symbolic, yet never inaccessible, this is artistically unique and overwhelmingly powerful.",
            "This is as challenging as movies come, alluding to everything from philosopher Thomas Hobbes to the history of Western music. But compared with Tarr's legendary S\u00e1tant\u00e1ngo... it's almost a quickie.",
            "Whatever your response, there's no doubting the technical brilliance of one extended sequence, as a mob rampages through a hospital before being halted by an unexpected vision. Astonishing.",
            "A mesmerizing eulogy to the waning days of artistic beauty and free speech, and not to be missed.",
            "The thing is, and this is easy to lose sight of in conversations about tracking shots and pointedly empty acting and symbolic cetaceans, [this] is an extraordinarily pleasurable experience to watch.",
            "... it is difficult not to be moved by the whale carcass, just as later, a naked old man discovered standing in a hospital bath finally quells the rioting - both symbols of man facing his mortality.",
            "Here cosmos and chaos, action and reaction, hope and despair, love and anger, all bump and grind together in a Satanic tango",
            "It's shot in static or very slow-moving long-takes; the monochrome images are deliberately oppressive; the pace would strike the organisers of a state funeral as excessively slow.",
            "Limited appeal, a slow pace, a demanding film; but as interesting a work of art as the best of films",
            "Operatic.",
            "A film that encourages one to put on their thinking cap.",
            "dares to say the apocalypse has a startling, bleak beauty all its own. ",
            "It is an arduous task, but the film achieves a transcendent and ethereal beauty that only the few truly great masterpieces attain.",
            "For once, understanding is less important than experiencing.",
            "A courageous and utterly unique world-view that will haunt you for days after you have seen it, Tarr's film -- despite the obscurity of its meaning -- remains a stimulating and daring piece of cinema to the end.",
            "This will be a tough watch for many: an uncompromisingly difficult and severe experience. But I found it unique, mesmeric and sublime.",
            "Werckmeister Harmonies exerts a peculiarly powerful spell."

            "If he makes it through the trial by fire -- and a blandly twisting plot with no meaningful revelations or substantial themes -- Hawke will get a promotion, but there's nothing in it for us.",
            "Marred slightly by an unsatisfactory climax, this is a cracking cop drama anchored by great performances and intelligent direction from Fuqua.",
            "Director Fuqua keeps it slick and sleazy and stokes up the race some, but this only accelerates the movie's deafening rush toward the top and ever over.",
            "Abruptly shifts gears, switching from character-driven issue-oriented thriller to formula action-driven cop flick.",
            "This could have been just another corrupt-cop thriller if it wasn't for the involvement of Denzel Washington, who works spectacularly against type in to come up with one of the more memorable screen villains.",

            "'Training Day' is still a very interesting thriller where Denzel Washington truly shines just as the lucid but equally necessary and inspired work of Ethan Hawke. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "A surprisingly excellent movie with Incredible performances...",
            "The movie moves rapidly, is extremely violent and not entirely plausible.",
            "This isn't a serious movie, despite Denzel Washington in full eruption and giving his calloused lines more weight and authority than they deserve.",
            "My guess is that the conceit was meant to be that Denzel's a bad guy, and that's fun to watch. Instead, this just adds another to his list of bad film's he's acted in...",
            "Cast against type as a corrupt cop, Denzel Washington, usually seen in noble and heroic roles, is nothing short of brilliant; with some luck, he should earn an Oscar nomination.",
            "Thumbs up, without question. Unfortunately, Training Day could have been so much more than it is.",
            "Denzel Washington delivers a remarkable performance in this enthralling and unique tale of a corrupt cop, completely transforming himself into an unexpectedly imposing threat.",
            "...an intelligent and riveting action movie that doesn't rely on a lot of special effects to tell a genuinely interesting story.",
            "While most critics have chosen to highlight Washington's performance as the standout, it would be unfair not to mention Ethan Hawke, who plays the rookie Hoyt with a perfect patina of guileless enthusiasm.",
            "It is unfortunate that the script by David Ayer is so riddled with pretense, but Washington, Hawke, and their supporting cast do all they can to play through.",
            "Denzel Washington's performance is tremendous... really up there amongst the best of his career."

            "For a film about homicide and class conflict, Gosford Park is surprisingly congenial.",

            "Taking advantage of a splendid cast, a sharply focused script and the fresh English setting, \"Gosford Park\" emerges as one of the most satisfying of Robert Altman's numerous ensemble pictures.",
            "Gosford is fine, well-groomed entertainment, but the road it takes has already been well paved.",
            "Altman's unexpected venture into Agatha Christie territory works a treat.",
            "A scintillating comedy-drama and one of [Altman's] most richly moving and entertaining pictures.",
            "The beauty of Robert Altman's Gosford Park is how it delicately balances the numerous storylines to create a wonderful mosaic of characters.",
            "Gosford Park expertly melds comedy and drama, eventually adding a pinch of intrigue with a second-act slaying.",
            "The film's end is especially haunting in a way I didn't initially grasp, and though his two following films definitely have their merits, Gosford Park has rightfully earned a reputation as Altman's last great work.",
            "A riotously fun take on the murder mystery genre, and the finest of the director's late period works.",
            "Great fun and remarkably, at two and a quarter hours, not a minute too long.",
            "This a marvellously entertaining confection, served up with a wonderfully light touch",
            "Robert Altman brings his gift for big, sprawling dramas knit with a fine weave of characters and a massive cast up to the task of filling them up with lives to the Merchant Ivory idiom of the manners and manors...",
            "Contents and style converge smoothly and seductively in Altman's luxuriant period drama that applies Agatha Christie murder-mystery format to a rigorous anatomy of British class structure in the 1930s, with all the who's who in U.K. in the cast.",
            "It's lovely to see that Altman, now in his 70s, still has an acid bite that would sting filmmakers half his age.",
            "Altman juggles about thirty different characters, moving them from the upper-class upstairs to the servants' quarters... and he does so without losing the audience.",
            "Pret-a-Porter and Dr. T. & and the Women, tarnished his '90s comeback, but the ornery Altman is back in top form here."

            "Brutal fight scenes and frank racial issues.",
            "I respect it enormously, but it feels like an art film in search of a movie. Mann recognizes the importance of Ali as an entertainer, but he's in danger of forgetting how to be one himself.",
            "The film gives Ali his due by refusing to idealize him or to gloss over his failings.",
            "Mann's compelling account of legendary boxer Muhammad Ali captures the considerable impact and charisma of the man who literally punched his way into the American consciousness.",
            "[Michael Mann] successfully recreates an era on screen and provides a great introduction to the fighter that is not clouded by sentimentality. ",
            "Will Smith takes the wise and sensible option of not trying to impersonate Ali per se, but rather tonally build an impression of Ali from his own natural register.",
            "A flawed film, then, and a comparative disappointment. But because of Smith, the scrupulous recreation of the period and the general quality of the performances, I'll score Ali a narrow victory on points.",
            "While making a great looking biopic that is filled with detail, Michal Mann forgot to make a film that entertains, creating an emotionally void, tone flat portrait of an athlete whose contribution socially and culturally has yet to be matched. ",
            "You can almost see him thinking his way through his fights...",
            "Mann vs. machine.",
            "More than competently mounted, with a hollowness just discernible in its core... feels like the first draft of whatever film Michael Mann set out to make.",
            "The challenge of dramatizing the celeb's life is only partially met nby Mann in this flawed biopic that narrowly focuses one one decade (1964-74), while gliding over Ali's private life and negletcing crucial aspects of his turbulent yet fascinating life.",
            "Smith, who has a well-developed ego of his own, not only looks like the young Ali but also sounds like the brash Louisville Lip.",
            "Smith's transformation is nothing less than astounding.",
            "No matter how good Smith and the other actors are, they seem at times dwarfed by the movie itself.",
            "Ali contains much information, lots of emotional depth, and a triumphant performance by Smith, but its dragging pace and tendency toward digression often seem to work against its good intentions."

            "Soderbergh absolutely nailed the formula for a modern heist movie, in a fashion so satisfying that nothing (including the film's sequels) has been able to match it since.",
            "Somehow this has emerged as one of the more entertaining films I've seen in months.",

            "A perfect example of smart, fun mainstream entertainment. David Holmes' mod-jazz score pulses with pep, and even with the star power, Steven Soderbergh makes room for winning supporting turns from Eddie Jemison, Shaobo Qin and Carl Reiner.",
            "An entertaining witty, funny, and well acted piece of comedy heist.",
            "Whatever you do, don't pay attention.",
            "Soderbergh and Griffin concoct a doozy of a robbery, seemingly impossible with a new hitch around every corner. The cast, headed by Clooney, never loses its cool and never gives away a surprise beforehand.",
            "A fast paced, enjoyable flick, stylishly filmed, filled with great, or at least well-known actors, that doesn't disappoint, but doesn't make a lasting impression either.",
            "We're not talking about reinventing the genre here. This is just a Big Mac and fries of a movie, and those movies, like the food, can hit the spot sometimes, especially when you're hung over.",

            "The human figure, however, remains a challenge to current CGI technology, since the detailing of hair and freckles, for instance, proves rather more credible than the marionette-like impression created by cold eyes and oddly unconvincing body movements.",

            "From a strictly visual standpoint, the film is like nothing you've ever seen. In terms of story, however, you've seen it all before.",
            "The story is well written and incredibly smart, but probably a bit too spiritual for western audiences.",
            "Even in the world of the digitally perfect, a black man seems doomed to be a disposable sidekick, and the heroine must represent every feminist ideal at once.",

            "Anyone expecting the combo of Allen and Albert Hughes and the famed Victorian serial-killer to result in a gritty, stygian, skin-crawling horror movie will be severely disappointed",

            "Fitfully arresting late night entertainment.",
            "Many of the ideas that were sophisticated in the original graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell look shopworn on screen.",

            "Moore might not be merrier, but this is far from offal.",
            "The problem with this film is that Jack the Ripper takes a backseat to the dull and terrible romance between Depp's policeman character and Heather Graham's prostitute character.",
            "See it for the stunning visuals and Depp's performance rather than a factual re-telling -- if you can stomach it. ",
            "Somehow, the movie taps into the book's uncanny implication that the very air is charged with malevolent ancient spirits...",
            "Without a script on which to hang their vision, the brothers can only technically succeed. And, for better or worse, they do.",
            "This is a film that should probably go back where it came from.",
            "A disappointingly conventional thriller from the Hughes brothers (Menace II Society still their best film by far), neither chilling enough as a horror flick nor compelling as a character study; one of Johnny Depp's few mediocre performances",
            "Jack the Ripper has proven a far more durable movie baddie than Freddy, Jason and Hannibal combined.",
            "This movie is beautiful to look at, but has little substance. All Depp and no depth.",
            "They want it to feel like one really bad dream ... and by the film's end we're too dizzy to think, to see if it all lines up.",
            "What the Hughes Brothers have done in making a lavish period piece complete ...... is nothing less than a revolutionary achievement.",
            "Some of the lines seem a bit over-the-top and the ending is improbable and schmaltzy, but it's a true Hollywood period film. Sit back and enjoy!",
            "As From Hell sprints toward its climax, the tone grows more grim, the violence more explicit and the conspiracies more shrill.",
            "The Hughes Brothers and their cast have taken Alan Moore's graphic novel of the same name and made it into one of the better bloody shockers of recent years.",
            "An interesting theory on the mystery of Jack the Ripper."

            "Pearl Harbor is a blockheaded, hollow-hearted industrial enterprise.",
            "The best way to see the movie is as I did: expecting nothing and being pleasantly surprised, and strangely moved, by Mr. Bay's audacity in filming his lovers in end-of-the-world close-ups, however briefly.",
            "The effect of watching a Michael Bay film is indistinguishable from having a large, pointy lump of rock drop on your head. His new picture, Pearl Harbor, maintains the mood.",
            "Pearl Harbor is a bomb, make no mistake. But the movie is such a noisy, persistent bomb that it is guaranteed to draw a crowd.",
            "For all the 118 actors listed, the movie offers almost no sense of authentic humanity. The faces the filmmakers plaster on their characters are as flat and stereotyped as those on war-recruitment posters.",
            "Leave it to Bay and Bruckheimer to reduce one of America's biggest military tragedies into a three-hour avalanche of Kodak moments, and one of America's defining crises into a facile exercise in fake uplift.",
            "Although Pearl Harbor will fill Disney's coffers, it will fail to fill your heart or adequately honor those men and women who were Pearl Harbor.",
            "... sensationalizing real events for a meaningless film, then coasting on a huge budget and advertising to lure in moviegoers thinking they'll see historic accuracy and drama. ",
            "...a typically bloated Michael Bay production that squanders its few positive attributes over the course of a ludicrously padded-out running time...",
            "A tepid, wannabe-Titanic love story, under the stewardship of a man whose career has ranged from the emotional depth of an 11-year-old boy all the way up to a 13-year-old boy.",
            "As impressive as the physical verisimilitude is, it only accentuates the contrast with the banalities of a script that lacks any fully developed characters.",
            "Bloated and boring, Pearl Harbor is a collection of war-movie clich\u00e9s.",
            "Three hours and three minutes of guff and goo about the nobility of killing and/or being killed for arbitrary reasons.",
            "There's no dismissing the film, if only because it offers another long, loud example of how Hollywood remains the hagiographic spinmeister of American war history.",
            "The centerpiece is the attack. For 50 minutes, the filmmakers unleash nonstop eye candy.",
            "Bay seems temperamentally incapable of holding a shot for much more than five seconds.",
            "Weaknesses of plot and characterisation are only amplified by the film's unwieldy size and patriotic portent, and the script is toe-curlingly bad.",
            "While the film manages to drag the actual attack out to 45 minutes of its ponderous 183 minute running time, that still leaves a lot of movie to be taken up by what passes for plot -- a convoluted romance of the heavily cliched kind.",
            "This is so bad, it's good. This is a real disaster.",
            "Those who should be offended are American veterans. Their service has been reduced to a sentimental fable of two heroic pilots and their noble lass proving their gumption and their bravery. Even as a tall tale, it's puny.",
            "Go for the rousing flag-waving, for the sense of experiencing a terrible and profound moment in history, but be prepared to swallow it all with a huge dose of treacle.",
            "Watch, enjoy, and then forget about it entirely.",
            "Even the much-vaunted depiction of the Japanese attack, while often visually arresting, still suffers from over-frenetic editing and more emphasis on adventure thrills than befits the tragedy of Pearl Harbor.",
            "There's a certain symbolic symmetry here. The Navy and Walt Disney have teamed up on the production, and both view history as something to be managed and exploited. "

            "The film manages to be both sarcastic and sentimental. As odd as the Tenenbaums are, the family remains bound by love.",
            "The Tenenbaums's self-referential outlook, wayward agendas, wanton destructiveness and wishful fantasy make for a highly entertaining spectacle, provided you acknowledge you're watching a churning status quo that will never alter in essentials.",
            "With Anderson's images, seductive as they are, we can ultimately only guess -- what Margot's plays are about, or who Etheline's suitors are... And that makes Anderson's film an exhilarating experience, a real jungle gym for the imagination.",
            "Each character, as ever, is tucked into a shell of his or her obsessions, and yet the filming itself -- the grace of Anderson's draftsmanship, as it were -- binds the figures together into a team.",
            "The fact that The Royal Tenenbaums is able to maintain a whimsical tone, coupled with profound moments of hurt and loss, and then still have the audacity to be an outright hilarious movie elevates it to something sensational.",
            "The Royal Tenenbaums is silly but full of love. It shows that even at their worst, there is always some good in every family...",
            "What really stands out is how rich the story's technical canvas and narrative textures actually are.",
            "Tenenbaums is excellent in its own right but it also serves as a perfect entry point to anyone new to the quirk-filled world of Wes Anderson. ",
            "There's so much to like about Wes Anderson's work, and it's hard not to warm to a guy who makes a comedy about damaged young has-beens. But he misfires badly in some crucial respects.",
            "Suffused with warmth and colour, and making liberal and inventive use of flashbacks, captions, voiceover and even chapter headings to break up the story, The Royal Tenenbaums won't be to everybody's taste, but it is a blast of original, irreverent air.",
            "With a stellar cast, gorgeous art direction and a surprisingly moving story [The Royal Tenenbaums is], a contender for Anderson's best work to date. ",

            "Anderson, who co-wrote the screenplay with Wilson, maintains a straight, deadpan tone throughout the film.",

            "Think of all the ways that a linear film structure stabilizes us - the cause and effect chain of events. But Memento is about a character completely destabilized, so Nolan destabilizes us accordingly in a way maybe no other movie has.",
            "Memento would only be half as fun with only one gimmick or the other. Instead, the backward storytelling and the frozen man make for a wonderful pair, combining into something far more redemptive than it sounds.",
            "I can't remember when a movie has seemed so clever, strangely affecting and slyly funny at the very same time.",
            "Writer-director Christopher Nolan's second film is one of the most original and ultimately confounding mind games to reach the screen since The Usual Suspects.",
            "The young British writer and director Christopher Nolan, who has every intention of putting us through the mill, doubles his fun by running the whole story backward.",
            "The astonishing payoff takes the film to another level entirely, unleashing a battery of existential questions that shed new light on everything that precedes it.",
            "Although the plot itself isn't terribly complex, the editing is so labyrinthine that multiple viewings are almost certainly necessary.",
            "The brain-teasing mystery put Christopher Nolan on the map as a filmmaking force...",
            "Pearce is positively astounding.",
            "Nolan's winding timelines and practical stunts are marvels to behold, but they seldom compare to the slow push-in on Leonard's face, as brief but powerful bursts of memory envelop the screen.",
            "Memento takes us on a mental trip of recovery, revenge, and remembering.",
            "Memento isn't just a film with a twist ending; its scatterbrained storytelling literally keeps you guessing with every scene.",
            "Christopher Nolan's cinematic breakthrough...",
            "If the prospect of having to do some of the work yourself doesn't alarm you, then Nolan's first American film is well worth catching, a thriller which is for once authentically Borgesian, to use an overworked qualifier.",
            "The three leads are excellent, but it's the masterful execution of an almost-too-clever-for-its-own-good concept which really makes this the most delicious kind of food for the mind.",
            "Pearce's central performance is as compelling as the film's premise and Nolan's execution of it. In Pearce's hands, Leonard is a time bomb with a short fuse.",
            "You have to pay close attention to Memento, the most original thriller to come along in years -- and one of the best.",
            "This terrific movie, about one man's quest for vengeance, does everything a thriller is supposed to do: intrigue, involve and keep you guessing.",
            "If nothing else, Memento is a savvy comment on the queasy uncertainties of the postmodern condition, in which history goes no further back than yesterday's news.",
            "The mystery requires a lot of concentration, but the stunning final scene is ample reward. Not just an indulgence, the ingenious structure makes the point that memory, although unreliable, is what we depend upon for our sense of reality.",
            "This is the kind of movie that gas-bag instructors use to illustrate the concept that one man's reality is another's fiction. But it's puny stuff compared to Kurosawa's Rashomon.",
            " treats the audience with respect without being overly pretentious",
            "Occasionally the film trips over its own complexity, but it's tense, devious and evokes Leonard's disorientation quite brilliantly. Operation of heavy machinery after watching is a definite no-no.",
            "More a puzzle than a meaningful story, it reminds me of how Edmund Wilson compared reading a mystery to eagerly unpacking a box of excelsior, only to find a few rusty nails at the bottom."
