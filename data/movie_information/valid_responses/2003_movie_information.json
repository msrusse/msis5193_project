            "The sense of closure is exquisite, but I'm not sure I'm able to forgive Peter Jackson for the three years that he has taken to put it on the screen. The wait has been excruciating.",
            "Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn is the good king of the title, and while the actor may look fetching in a crown and cloak, he doesn't have half of the gravitas of Sean Bean's Boromir in the first film.",
            "With The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, Peter Jackson delivers a decent ending to his fantasy trilogy -- actually, about 12 endings.",
            "The Return Of The King ultimately proves up to the series' increasingly difficult task: making movies that echo legends, making legends that reflect life, and reconciling it all with the fact that both legends and lives all eventually meet their ends.",
            "Yes, the running time is long, and yes, those many endings in a slow, dreamy coda left me feeling spent -- better spent than I can ever remember.",
            "Standing out amid an excellent cast is Elijah Wood, stymied by tweeness in the earlier films but here convincingly developing the character of Frodo as the embodiment of valor and self-sacrifice.",
            "...one of the greatest good vs evil stories ever told...",
            "The massive scope of this climactic chapter is once again awe-inspiring, entailing exceptional use of computer graphics, prosthetics and makeup, costuming, and sets.",
            "For 2004 [the special effects] look great.",
            "Peter Jackson's place in cinematic history is cemented with The Return of the King and now Star Wars seems like a film made a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. ",
            "The Return of the King is really the heart of this cinematic masterpiece.",
            "At a whopping, hilarious, 4.20 duration for the extended version, Return of the King is the Oscar-winning, magnum opus of the franchise.",
            "This atavistic Christians-vs-Moors narrative doesn't belong in the present day, and that's no doubt why so many people are addicted to it: it's so ideologically overstated that it can easily be brushed off as harmlessly quaint escapism.",
            "[It[ almost needs no review. If you liked, or disliked, either of the first two films, this one offers more of the same, with the emphasis on the \"more.\" ",
            "Ultimately, the chief difference between this film and its two predecessors is the presence of resolution. The story ends, just like we all knew it would. And there's something inherently disappointing about that.",
            "This is the crowning glory -- a cinematic feat that satisfies at every level.",
            "Satisfyingly, Astin's Sam grows the most here, coming into his heroic own. His big eyes, gazing adoringly and beseechingly at the tormented Frodo, speak volumes about loyalty and bravery.",
            "For all its mythic, metaphorical weight, The Return of the King and its two predecessors finally speak to the dignity and humanity of the smallest among us. And the best movie masterpieces have always been made of such common stuff.",
            "The third part of Peter Jackson's monumental Lord Of The Rings trilogy fully lives up to its predecessors.",
            "It may not beat The Two Towers for sheer spectacle and thrill, but this is still some feat.",
            "The best part in the best movie trilogy of all time.",
            "In Return of the King, the battle for the very survival of Middle Earth and all its fantastical creations will be fought, and unless you are a congenital buzz-kill, you will feel the urgency, terror, and sweeping import of it all.",
            "I'm still not as blissed out by this trilogy as are hardcore fans of the J.R.R. Tolkien novels or filmgoers who revel in endless battle scenes. Still, this end chapter is as visually spectacular -- with its mythological creatures -- as movies get.",
            "A worthy conclusion to a modern epic. Don't worry that your expectations will be too high -- Return Of The King will exceed them all."

            "There is some fun to be had in the outrageous mayhem, particularly with yet more chase sequences (repetitious as they may be).",
            "A monument to excess both exhausting and entertaining, Bad Boys II challenges audiences to withstand 2.5 hours of stamina-sapping \"Bayhem,\" but benefits from the heightened, almost surreal vulgarity at its core.",
            "Perhaps it's the chemistry between its two leads, or perhaps it's the way director Michael Bay pounds action sequence after action sequence. One things for sure: The film proves, ultimately, to be a perfect example of mindless summer escapism.",
            "An unpleasant, mean movie all the way.",
            "I love Will Smith. And this is the first film this summer to pass the Joel Siegel sequel test: If this had been the first one would you want to see a sequel of it? Yeah. Although shorter.",
            "Well, at least Bad Boys II was better than Pearl Harbor.",
            "You can&#146;t fault it for pure action, I s&#146;pose, but it left me feeling cold.",
            "Clever ideas and hilarious moments drown in a flood of violence and profanity.",
            "It's only when Bay turns serious in the final 20 minutes that the movie founders, and then sinks, under the weight of his Pearl Harbor-type pretentiousness.",
            "By the end, you're past caring who kills whom and just want to escape from this smug, sadistic nonsense.",
            "Despite the energetic efforts of Smith and Lawrence, Boys is yet another hyperventilating sequel with an inflated plot and running time.",
            "The action is what makes the movie. Smith and Lawrence's witty comebacks and petty quarrels are still funny though they'll never be as fresh.",
            "Like the first film, this is basically a generic buddy cop movie and an episode of Miami Vice fused together, towing a trunk of old boring ideas and pointless camera tricks.",
            "Overlong, overblown and underwritten it may be, but Bad Boys II still punches the pleasure centres enough to qualify as big, dumb fun. Just.",
            "Epitomising everything that's wrong with modern Hollywood, Bad Boys II isn't simply bad, it's one of the worst films of the year.",
            "Generic, loud and violent action; not for kids.",
            "Sure, we can quibble about the bloodied body parts, the gluttony of bullets and gore, but who's gonna give a damn, when there's so much fun to be had?",

            "Such a lovely film I couldn't help but flip over it.",
            "A sappy, self-congratulatory tale of triumph of penniless newcomers over every sort of adversity, and a close brush with death every time they set foot outside of their apartment.",
            "Lovingly shot, with a remarkable debut from Sarah Bolger, who along with sister Emma, gives one of the greatest ever child performances.",
            "A solid, if unspectacular family film.",

            "A genuinely touching movie about a family that doesn't condescend to audiences or wrap its lessons into neat, tidy packages.",
            "Sheridan should also be applauded for keeping the film going at a nice pace, sprinkling it with many lighter moments, as well as one of the more suspenseful scenes from any movie last year.",
            "...a scrapbook of family history that has gained poignancy through the showing and telling but remains recognizably a family story rather than a myth or epic.",

            "In America gets better after a muddled start.",
            "The film's blend of heartbreak and hope is perhaps Sheridan&#8217;s greatest achievement, and it gives us a work that&#8217;s as lovable as it is challenging. ",

            "This doesn't mean that Ryan is bad in the film, for she's not -- she's merely adequate, if a little bland, in a bad picture. And In the Cut is indeed a bad picture; surprisingly bad, really, given the pedigree involved.",
            "The plotting and police procedural aspects of In the Cut are perfunctory and unconvincing, and for all its air of breaking new ground, it is ploughing down some familiar furrows.",
            "There's nothing terribly involving or enlightening in this brooding fever dream about life and death on the dingy margins of the city.",

            "What we end up with is a triumph of style over confused content.",
            "I never found myself relaxed watching In the Cut. There is a pat, color-by-numbers quality to the inherent whodunit and the urban backdrop feels gratuitous and empty,",
            "The camera explores the female body lovingly, with a gently curious eye. This fascinating approach begs for more imitation.",
            "Ryan gives a career redefining performance.",
            "Weak plot with grisly middle; should've been NC-17.",

            "Jane Campion enters the world of suspense thrillers, as well as the landscape of American filmmaking, with mixed results.",

            "Technically brilliant, and Ryan is utterly compelling. But ultimately it's too voyeuristic and cold to recommend without reservations.",
            "Obsession is central to this erotic thriller. But there's also an obsessive quality to the filmmaker's take on her material, which was adapted from a novel by Susanna Moore, as if the genre excluded all that is spontaneous, frivolous or light."

            "Oldboy has more to offer than action and violence - it's an imaginative tale of guilt and revenge, with a shocking climax that will live long in the memory.",
            "When it was first released back in 2003 Park Chan-wook's Oldboy hit audiences like a hammer. Forget Spike Lee's 2013 US remake with Josh Brolin, this South Korean film is the only version of Oldboy that needs to be seen.",

            "Gorgeous cinematography, powerful writing, and bravura sequences",

            "Banzai-violence kin to \"Cast Away\" about a man at time's cruel whim, \"Oldboy\"is an endurance test worth taking. Its conclusion is the most sadistic and destructively wrathful since \"Seven,\" and the point of no return has rarely shocked this much.",
            "Intense and dark but also humorous and moving, this is an ambitious film that fulfils its promise, despite an arguably overly protracted denouement. Excellent.",

            "Nice as it would be to report that Ang and his co-writer/producer James Schamus had regenerated the summer blockbuster, we gotta poop the party.",
            "If Lee wanted to do Michael Bay and the Bruckheimer cigar-chompers out of a living, he could, but he must know there are better ways to \"think big\".",
            "The special effects of Hulk's appearance may not themselves be staggering, but there's something intriguing about the compositions Lee invents for his fugitive.",
            "An interesting effort to give one of the staples of mass entertainment something extra in the way of insight and feeling.",
            "The 138-minute runtime is just unforgiveable.",
            "I ask you: Is this not the correct way, the honorable way, for a studio to spend $150 million of its summer capital? Universal said The Hulk, and Lee heard something else, perhaps a story of dysfunctional families torn apart by ambition.",
            "Director Ang Lee has carefully crafted a movie that tells a very deliberate story, to the point where the action almost seems secondary. While some fans may be turned off by this approach, it's a fresh spin that works for the most part.",
            "By the time Hulk reaches its thermo-biblical climax, no one can complain that this is a macho blockbuster with no substance. Call it Crouching Ego, Hulking Id.",
            "Even if Lee would have wanted to rise above the simple two-dimensional universe of the comic books, his portrayal remains just as flat.",
            "In this one the Hulk bounces all over the place. The best part is Lou Ferrigno's cameo. ",
            "The worst thing I can say about this movie is that it's so smart, so deep, so well done, it might be too good for the teenage boy-audience these films are usually aimed at. Then again, that might be the best thing I can say about it.",
            "Whatever problems it has as a story, at least Hulk tried, honestly and desperately, to push the comic book move into new places emotionally and stylistically.",
            "The Hulk lacks personality; not a great movie.",
            "The best comic book adaptation I've seen so far with an excellent cast and top notch special effects...",
            "A turgid, CGI-Frankenstein reject",
            "The spectacular special effects and Lee's use of split screens provide some relief in a nonetheless tedious tale in which Nick Nolte (looking much like his recent mug shot) provides several unintentional laughs as Banner's father.",
            "The film almost matches the inner conflict of its titular character, intermittently bogged down even as it soars to seemingly impossible heights.",
            "Lee and Schamus try on film genres like The Silence of the Lambs' Buffalo Bill tries on human skin.",

            "What a strange and fascinating contraption Hulk is.",

            " \"Touching the Void\" towers above the rest of that rarest of all film genres, the docudrama. ",

            "A slow starter which builds into a chilling depiction of the agonising disintegration of body and mind as they are exposed to the elements.",
            "About a primal war waged by man against both himself and the natural world that surrounds him.",
            "It's certainly a far better thriller than anything Hollywood has churned out lately.",

            "if you've considered heading for the high ground, the movie might steer you toward a less taxing hobby -- perhaps chainsaw-juggling or organizing piranha water ballets. ",

            "Maxwell continues his textbook emphasis on military maneuvers, but despite literally thousands of Civil War reenactors recruited for the film, the wide-screen canvas fails to map the tactics or evoke the terror of battle.",
            "The procession of monotonous, oddly gore-free battles breaks frequently for bloated speechifying.",
            "Every shot is fired in sorrow, and there are no villains - except, of course, for the politicians, who remain safely out of the frame.",
            "Incredibly boring and badly acted.",
            "Swapping politics for crass platitudes, Gods and Generals is a monumental folly.",
            "Full of windy speeches about honor, god, fealty, and so on, the movie comes to a literal standstill whenever one of these noble addresses is about to be delivered.",
            "Succumbs to turgidity. And...intentionally or not...conveys the impression that the film uncritically celebrates the Confederacy. [Blu-ray]",
            "Meticulous Civil War story runs a little long.",
            "Everybody is so good and decent that it's hard to tell where the generals leave off and the gods start.",
            "A labour of love with special interest to history buffs, this epic film is extraordinary in many ways.",
            "The big battles impress, but become somewhat samey. Part Three is threatened.",
            "Then there is 'Gods and Generals,' cut from the same production cloth as 'Gettysburg' but a film of very loose ends.",
            "You will watch a series of battle re-enactments and wait for a film to break out.",
            "Thinks it is grand without ever being so.",
            "Imagine watching half of Band of Brothers in one sitting, but with the story moving at a much slower pace.",
            "War may be Hell, but in this three-and-a-half-hour Civil War epic from Ronald Maxwell, the syrupy monologues and righteous Bible thumping provide the punishment.",
            "An interesting film weakened by ham-fisted writing and direction and heavy-handed revisionism.",
            "Maxwell has made the, shall we say interesting, decision to change [Stonewall Jackson]God's hellcat into a warm and fuzzy teddy bear.",
            "A stiff and stilted historical pageant that somehow manages to make the savage tumult of thousands pitched against thousands seem not so much dreadul as dreadfully dull.",
            "Stay far away from the three hour-plus Gods and Generals--unless, of course, you need a good nap.",
            "If D.W. Griffith's 1915 Civil War stunner, 'The Birth of a Nation,' was 'history writ with lightning,' in the famous phrase of President Woodrow Wilson, than Ted Turner's 'Gods and Generals' is history writ with sorghum...",
            "A repulsive combination of dry textbook history and pandering melodrama.",
            "Never manages anything like thrills and by the long-delayed end has turned into one big forced march.",
            "Unlike 'Gettysburg,' however, 'Gods and Generals' is slow-moving and stilted and is punctuated by speeches rather than drama and action."

            "Even Monica Bellucci as Carlo's former girlfriend can't save it from mediocrity.",

            "Remember Me, My Love might sound like a love story, but it makes romance look pretty bleak.",
            "A lively if overlong movie that allows for the full spectrum of human emotion and behavior.",
            "There just doesn't seem the need for this much needy self-absorption.",
            "The movie is being sold as a romance with the tag line: 'Some loves are never forgotten.' But the only love evident here is self-love, and the overall feel is disturbingly soulless.",
            "If it were less prone to soap-opera histrionics, this screechy saga of an upscale family collapsing under the weight of its members' self-absorption might have something worth saying.",
            "How often does a director make pretty much the same film twice in a row and pretty much nail it both times?",
            "Muccino and co-writer Heidrun Schleef's script is filled with the kind of sad wisdom that comes with age, and the film is acted with maximum fidelity to the emotional ugliness of real life.",

            "If this movie is any indication, middle-class urbanites in Italy are even more crass, old-age-phobic and obsessed with body-image than their counterparts in the United States."

            "...has half the racing scenes, twice the plot and none of the Vin Diesel.",
            "Loads up on colors, cars and characters to distract from what's missing under the creative hood, yet this spirited sequel is fun as it rarely takes itself too seriously.",

            "The philosophy here is when you can't make high art, make high trash.",

            "Played to perfection by Paul Giamatti, Pekar defies the categories of hero, villain, or even anti-hero. He simply exists, an ordinary man trying to make the best of a largely disappointing life.",
            "What makes the film special throughout is the way its form mirrors its subject matter. On every level, it's a film about unlikely marriages.",

            "Channels Pekar's vision of art and life as twinned struggles. One of cinema's great first-date sequences is here. We're splendidly shown how a lower-class nine-to-fiver has his own creative selves and richly expressive life.",
            "Earthy, gritty and real; for older kids.",
            "Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini's biopic about Harvey Pekar - who injected schadenfreude into the superhero-comics world - wonderfully etches one man's exploration of using misery as a creative outlet and, eventually, a critical coping mechanism.",

            "A life affirming experience, perhaps even a life changing one.",
            "The movie is as unclassifiable as the comic -- neither documentary nor biopic, or maybe both.",
            "Mr. Giamatti and Ms. Davis seem to feed off each other, bringing out the best performances we've seen from these actors.",
            "If you can get through the confusing goings-on of the first reel, then this is a satisfying experience -- funny, touching and tragic by turns. And Giamatti deserves every award going.",
            "The blend of styles results in an edgy, touching, original story about a working-class man who channels his gloom, grime and longing into comic art",

            "It didn't excite me or hold my interest, though everything about it was modestly successful.",
            "... boasts a number of essential, if slightly twisted, fairy-tale elements that give the movie an engaging, slightly otherworldly air -- one that occasionally clashes with, but more often enhances, the all-too-human foibles at its heart.",
            "Castle (captures) a coming-of-age story and the changing romantic and economic relationships between family, friends, and paramours. It's a diamond in the rough.",
            "For those of you, men or women, who love, have loved, or will love-this film will have something to say to you.",

            "The tropical pleasure is a beautifully imagined adventure that beguiles children and tickles adults.",

            "The visuals are as sharp as the scripting, succeeding with laughs, thrills, heartache, and unforgettable characterizations to craft an animated masterpiece.",
            "Compared to other Pixar films, this may not be as good as the Toy Story franchise, but it's awfully close.",
            "A family film that is truly for the whole family - from grandpop to grandson. Finding Nemo is a precious gem in the Pixar and Disney vaults. Exquisitely stunning, enchanting and magical from start to finish.",
            "It's downright curmudgeonly to remain focused on the negatives when the rest of the picture is saturated with invention and wit.",
            "Pixar really knocked it out of the park on this one.",
            "Most of all, Finding Nemo is a touching tale which reassures you that even though things may look bleak, it will all turn out well in the end.",
            "This gem of a film is the one with which Pixar asserted their supremacy over the animated world.",
            "...a good-but-hardly-great animated endeavor from Pixar. ",
            "Finding Nemo is ultimately a rewarding, engaging, compelling, and even spiritual adventure that works charismatically on multiple levels.",
            "It looks great, of course: All the Pixar movies do. But the genius of those other movies lay in their actual stories -- stories as inspired as the animation.",
            "Beautiful.",
            "Visually, Finding Nemo is spectacular. The animators render theses scenes with exquisite detail and vibrant color, reaching beyond mere CGI-wizardry to artistry.",
            "A beguiling piece of storytelling and creates a magical underwater world through its imaginative graphics and sound effects.",
            "Artistically, it's up there with the all-time animated greats.",
            "The animation in Finding Nemo is quite breathtaking and this movie, created by Pixar, the same outfit that made Toy Story, looks like The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau.",
            "A spectacular comedy-adventure that's never less than totally immersive. Not quite the masterpiece that Toy Story was, but it's the closest Pixar have come since.",
            "Finding Nemo is a wonderment, certainly not human, yet humorously humane.",
            "A lavish feast and the best family catch of the summer blockbuster season."

            "Ao contr\u00e1rio do impec\u00e1vel anti-her\u00f3i do original, Nick Nolte confere vulnerabilidade ao protagonista e, no processo, leva esta refilmagem a superar a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de 1955.",

            "Too closely cropped to allow for the expansive feel of an oceanic epic, and fails to develop any meaningful relationships among its characters.",

            "The 'wit' is leaden and unfunny; the narrative's progress ungainly; the direction stolid.",
            "One conceit of writer-director Stephen Fry is to dramatize parties as knots of chaos, social hurricanes that spill across the landscape this way and that, ruining lives, eating time, preventing progress of any kind.",
            "Though Fry's movie has plenty of nasty wit, it lacks the sheer luxurious malice of Waugh's book. Fry is acerbic; Waugh is lethal.",
            "Suffers from feeling like it's just pretending to be good when it's obviously much, much happier being bad. But when it's bad, it's very, very good.",
            "What's good about the movie is the lesser known up-and-corners who play the bright young things themselves, especially the appellatorily appropriate Fenella Woolgar as Agatha",
            "Though it falls short of Fry's best work in other fields, this is a sound first feature.",
            "The wit never comes through the art deco settings.",

            "It is in the humorous moments that the movie really hits its stride, with the supporting cast providing many of the laughs.",
            "The uninitiated are hereby warned: Bright Young Things has an exclusionary timbre. Unlike Hollywood films it never slows down to explain a joke or clarify an allusion.",
            "Fry often seems unsure of whether he wants to stress satire or drama, and while a good film can be both, this film is neither.",
            "A great deal of fun for its first two-thirds.",
            "Fry seems to believe there's nothing that would fulfill audiences more than to vicariously tag along on screen after fictionalized celebrity types from another time.",
            "Memorable characters come and go so often and so franticaly that you wonder if World War II might have been merely the explosion of England's fast pulse.",

            "With the portrait of the suicidal lover, Scherfig searches for an irony that loses its ingenuity when the melodrama makes sense and leaves the main text in a kind of reductionist void. [Full review in Spanish]",

            "Although at times too low-key, Wilbur is a humorous and strangely uplifting film about death and dying.",

            "The film nails both the malaise and creative vigor of Curtis' short, bruised and chillingly relatable life.",

            "There is so much to admire in Matt Dillon's City of Ghosts that the feeling left over after watching it is an unsettling sense of disappointment and unfairness.",
            "While it won't be remembered as great cinema, it is actually a tight piece of film noir.",
            "While the film is not short on ideas or implications, none of them is fully developed, leaving us little but atmosphere and warm whiskey to drink in.",
            "A long, winding, but decently layered modern film noir.",
            "Trades more effectively in states of alienated atmospheric delirium than it does the specific mechanics of plot.",
            "Dillon doesn't quite pull it off, but you've got to admire the guy's chutzpah.",
            "can be criticised of many things, but wasting locations and local talent is not one of them",
            "The surprise is not necessarily that Dillon has a unique voice, but rather that the voice is so bizarrely dark and uninhibitedly exotic.",
            "Shows some promise in that it wants to say something, but there are plenty of forgettable moments to go along with it.",
            "There's nothing interesting about this half-baked noir plot...",
            "The movie fairly oozes with atmosphere, and its cast contains enough colorful characters to make Casablanca blush.",
            "Matt Dillon is a hero worried about his karma",
            "Longtime actor, first-time director Matt Dillon relates an urgency and passion behind the camera, intent on telling us one story while showing us another.",
            "Dillon is so eager to show the duality of Cambodia, the grace and the grime, that he sacrifices major story elements to do so.",
            "Though 'City of Ghosts' can't match its models, it takes us close enough to Greeneland to be a worthy homage and an impressive, though flawed, debut...well worth a look.",
            "A bit of exotic neo-noir, clunky in parts and long, but often engaging and artfully atmospheric as well.",
            "In the end, it becomes clear that the missing ingredient in City of Ghosts is nothing more than some additional directing experience on the part of Dillon.",
            "City of Ghosts dons a facade of independent filmmaking, but the core screams Hollywood rehash.",
            "It's the only film in which James Caan attempts karaoke in Cambodian. You'll want to plan your bathroom break for that scene.",
            "City of Ghosts doesn't quite work, but it has its moments, and some of them just may be worth the price of admission.",
            "Though he has evolved beyond his star peak, [Dillon] remains a strong actor and is a gifted director.",
            "Fortunately, Dillon was smart enough to hire one of our best living crime authors Barry Gifford to co-write the screenplay."

            "the true horror here, far from being some middle-eastern revenant in a cowboy hat, is the indignity of disease, the anonymity of old age, and the inevitability of death",

            "There's good stuff in the margins. But on the heels of such successful comic-book adaptations as X-Men and Spider-Man, Johnson's film makes Daredevil look like the second-rate hero he never really was.",
            "Torn between moody grandiosity and cartoonish mayhem, Daredevil tries to have it both ways, and succeeds at neither.",
            "An event pic that is big, brassy and bullying enough to make you forget how little of it is actually making sense.",
            "When you compress almost forty years of storytelling into a single movie, you need a writer of considerable talent to winnow a massive amount of material into an entertaining and intelligible film. Mark Steven Johnson does not apparently possess that...",
            "Alas. You'll have to be pretty daring yourself to go see Daredevil.",
            "Daredevil has a brooding dark and dank air about it, much like Batman. That's about the only element that lends the movie any character.",
            "Gatorade baths and clingy clothes.",
            "Writer-director Mark Steven Johnson's movie is too heavily reliant on tried and tested ingredients, such as Batman-type design and Matrix-style fighting.",
            "The ghostly sonar effects showing how Matt \"sees\" through sound are interesting, and Farrell's mad dog performance is fun. But overall Daredevil is nothing to marvel about.",
            "Much of the film is a setup for hoped-for sequels, so the plot isn't really the thing. But Daredevil benefits from some strong supporting roles.",
            "Daredevil, as brought to the screen by writer/director Mark Steven Johnson, brings real violence and death into the comic book mix, and the result is a fascinating blend of the fantastic and the tragic.",
            "Daredevil is a perfectly serviceable B-movie, something to tide over genre fans waiting for X-Men 2.",
            "For all its clich\u00e9s, it has a cracking third act, helped by doses of 15-rated violence.",
            "there's a lot to like here and a comic film more people should give another chance.",
            "Superhero is darker, more violent than Spiderman.",
            "The film is impressively dark and gritty, but the melodrama and Daredevil's relationship with woman warrior Elektra are labored.",
            "Justice may be blind, but the only enjoyment to be had out of this is to be blind drunk.",
            "Give it a shot, and you'll be pleasantly surprised.",

            "The great neglected movie of 2003, a rambunctious, provocative, genre-defying, and constantly surprising experiment.",
            "A willful mess made interesting by the talent that it attracted.",

            "It's the sort of nonsense that's intriguing for about 15 minutes, simply because its incoherence approaches a surreal level. But then the novelty wears off, and it settles into being the worst thing a movie can be: boring."

            "A passable time-waster ... directed with some grace and snap.",
            "Heist movies seem pretty quaint and analog in our era where high stakes crime is primarily electronic in nature. But until someone can make embezzlement cinematically interesting, we're left with theft and this movie just gets away with it.",

            "Gray does a solid enough job behind the camera, although it's clear he feels more at home directing the action sequences than the quieter moments.",

            "Soapy and trashy, and more than a little bit ludicrous. But there's quite a bit of subtext if you need it.",
            "...Busch drags his campy send-up of Hollywood melodramas to the screen, and honey does it drag.",
            "It plugs ahead on the stamina and sheer nerve of its author-star.",
            "This is such a smug, self-satisfied film that it will leave a bad taste in your mouth, whether you're a fan of old melodramas or not.",
            "It's a tawdry, silly and self-satisfied film, but in the best ways.",
            "A loving homage to every movie Joan Crawford ever barreled her shoulder pads through.",
            "The best thing about \"Die, Mommie Die\" is the title.",
            "Director Mark Rucker has the right intentions, but unfortunately, not enough skill in terms of comic timing and film pacing to make this confection really soar into parody heaven.",
            "A one-note farce that struggles just to remain on key.",
            "Bad camp...despite the stylistic similarity, about as far from 'Far from Heaven' as you can get.",
            "Charles Busch channels Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Lana Turner and Susan Hayward in the lovingly crafted \"Die Mommie! Die!\" - this you HAVE to see!",
            "[Busch] is a performer who is more diva than most of the ovary-packing portion of the population and twice the dame",
            "The most notable aspect of \"Die, Mommie, Die\" is the great female impersonation performance by Charles Busch as the ardent Angela."

            "The documentary still works as an introduction to a thinker whose influence, as the passionate praise of Desmond Tutu attests, lasted far beyond his martyrdom.",

            "A heroic odyssey that is illuminated with admirable clarity.",

            "There is both spiritual and historical substance in the things said, and such obvious reverence for the subject, that the film ultimately has a charming charmlessness.",
            "It never quite escapes the classroom and church group, and it seems a little too content to view Bonhoeffer as a martyr.",
            "Today's church needs Bonhoeffer's example and teaching, and Doblmeier's project makes a worthy contribution to our understanding of this great man.",
            "Bonhoeffer doesn't probe as deeply as one might like into the details and implications of his theology, but is an invaluable study of a man of conscience. ",
            "To its credit, the film examines Bonhoeffer's life and thought in an expressly theological light&#133; [His ideas] are as integral to the portrait as his resistance work.",
            "Bonhoeffer follows the life of one prominent churchman as he develops an ethics to nourish the anti-Nazi resistence.",
            "A solid and respectable piece about a man of enormous integrity and courage.",
            "With this much intrigue and planning, passion and conviction, political and religious controversy, this story should have been riveting, but it's not.",
            "Though we get little sense of Bonhoeffer the man, the film remains a fascinating account of the evolution of his revisionist thought, which led to a theological justification of collective and, if necessary, violent resistance to tyranny.",
            "Director Martin Doblmeier has assembled an impressive array of archival material and recent interviews.",
            "When its subject is as fascinating as Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a movie doesn't need bells and whistles.",
            "\"Bonhoeffer\" is a sometimes-fascinating piece of historical work, especially for the amateur scholars interested in all things about the rise and fall of the Nazis, but loses steam when it shifts to the courageous, bland life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer.",
            "The documentary \"Bonhoeffer\" is certainly interesting due to its subject, but not very cinematic or emotionally engaging",
            "It's hard to point to anything Bonhoeffer did or said that would merit the lionization he receives in Bonhoeffer.",
            "Provides both a viewpoint on and images of the period unlike those of other films on the Third Reich era.",
            "While material is well-researched and informative, the presentation is dry.",
            "The life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the pacifist theologian in Germany who spoke out openly and strongly against Hitler, would make one hell of a movie. Unfortunately, Martin Doblmeier's documentary Bonhoeffer isn't it.",

            "A fascinating study of the '80s not merely captivated by leg warmers and shoulder pads, but by the tenor of our cultural obsessions at the time.",
            "Packed to the rafters with fine old competition footage and clips from Vision's wildly popular skateboarding videos, but it's Gator's imprisoned voice ... that lends the film its most tragic overtones.",
            "Engrossing and unusual.",
            "[Stickler] does such a fine job of depicting the skill and thrill of skateboarding, she also helps us understand that Gator's downfall really came about because he hit the top of his sport at the exact moment it was about to change into something else.",
            "Even when sketched in broad terms, Rogowski's downward spiral makes for compelling viewing, and to her credit, director Stickler never romanticizes her subject.",
            "Stickler deftly weaves Gator's tragedy in with an entertaining larger story of how skateboarding captured youth culture.",
            "By focusing on the self-immolation of the thoroughly despicable skateboarding star Mark \"Gator\" Rogowski, Stoked makes us all question the eternal chase for popularity and acceptance that takes up so much of daily life."

            "Violence and revenge have been a staple of Eastwood's work from the beginning, but here he explores his subject from a new, more ambiguous angle, with no regard for macho titillation. ",
            "It is in many ways Eastwood's tightest movie for some time, and certainly his darkest since Unforgiven; indeed, the ending offers as corrosive an assessment of the limits of American justice as anything in his career.",
            "Sean Penn is so frighteningly good in this movie that he outdoes even the best of his earlier work.",

            "While not quite the equal of the novel, it's more complex, emotionally-charged and better acted than the average Hollywood thriller.",
            "With characters that don't belong in the film and resolutions that seem mere fantasy, Mystic River never surpasses adequacy.",

            "Fellini came close to painting his thoughts directly onto the screen. Born Liar honors this approach by putting lyricism ahead of clarity. You get the feeling that the maestro would appreciate the results.",
            "Pettigrew's movie functions nicely as a posthumous couch trip, with Fellini explaining the soulful puppetry of his art without pulling the curtain up far enough to let you catch him pulling the strings.",
            "A disappointment, not to mention a squandered opportunity.",
            "It goes in circles and wears out its welcome, except for the most hard-core enthusiasts.",
            "If you know little about Fellini, this is not the place to start. Begin with the films.",
            "The film, for all its frustrating qualities, does bring us closer to this intriguing, seductive and admittedly devious artist.",
            "A strange beast, but one lifelong Fellini fans will find irresistible.",
            "Little appears to be filmed for the movie itself, or at least within the last decade, and the caliber tends to be less than a Bravo profile.",

            "It almost seems that documentarian Damian Pettigrew didn't have enough Fellini material to draw from.",
            "There may be better straight introductions to the accomplishments of this most poetic of cinematic artists, but for the already initiated this will serve as a welcome remembrance.",
            "It's interesting, but I'm not sure how informative this documentary really is. Fellini fans will certainly appreciate it more than the casual moviegoers.",

            "Lyrical and visceral.",
            "Born liar or windbag? Either way, Fellini clearly likes telling women to spread their legs. Wider.",
            "Includes generous clips of Fellini's great 8 1/2 (1963) which is, to this day, clearly a more compelling Fellini biography than anything Pettigrew could have come up with."

            "Seabiscuit is not a work of great art, but it tells its solid story with grace and dignity.",
            "We root for Seabiscuit, of course, but more out of obligation than devotion -- after all, we paid to see him.",
            "So predictable that even this true story--the one so few people today know anything about -- seems like an accomplished fact before the opening credits are through.",
            "It's a well-made film with some nice performances, but it lacks any sort of dramatic fire.",
            "The foolproof recipe for an old-fashioned, crowd-pleasing slice of summer counterprogramming, and Gary Ross hasn't botched the ready-made job.",

            "This stylized romantic comedy offers limited, largely synthetic rewards.",
            "From the couch on a lazy Sunday afternoon, that wouldn't be so bad, but when we've been summoned to the cinema, we expect something more.",
            "This is a micro-budgeted tribute to Hollywood musicals of the '40s and '50s that's all the more endearing for its flaws.",
            "The script is a sappy '40s melodrama transported into the 21st century, where it just creaks.",
            "[T]he wonderful standards soundtrack can't disguise the lack of chemistry between Rose and either of her leading men...",
            "A low-budget valentine to big-budget Hollywood musicals of the 1940s and '50s, this affectionate homage to dreamy movie romances is a sweet-natured charmer in its own right.",
            "The thin story -- a 32-year-old woman who lives at home with Mom, sings in the bar at an airport motel, and lives in a fantasy world of musicals -- feels less romantic than pathetic."

            "This isn't a radical film by any means, but in its gentle tempo, its avoidance of the obvious and stubborn insistence on the decency of its three touchingly human characters, 'Springtime in a Small Town' weighs in as refreshingly, pleasurably different.",

            "No film I have ever seen has come so close to convulsing my entire being as has Au Hasard Balthazar.",
            "The film is perhaps the director's most perfectly realised, and certainly his most moving.",

            "I think this is a superb movie for its original content, exhilarating editing and Bresson's Puritanistic camera work, belt-high and wonderfully toned, that creates a deep, damp, weathered quality of centuries-old provincialism.",
            "A film that despite its obvious religious overtones is much more about the hell of relationships based on commodities rather than sin.",
            "One of the great masterpieces of world cinema: austere, warm, grim, surreal, shocking and heartbreaking.",
            "The antithesis of cute Disney films about animals, Au Hasard, Balthazar is a stark meditation on existence in which meaning is conveyed through images and sounds, culminating in a moment of sublime epiphany.",
            "With Bresson, patience is rewarding, and not just because Balthazar has an ending both strangely beautiful and profoundly sad. It's worth the effort to connect to this singular vision, one that's austere and humane in equal measure.",
            "Very much deserves its art-house cred.",
            "If you can see past the heavy-handed religious overtones you will encounter an inspired and deeply intelligent Bresson classic.",
            "It's a cinematic experience that deserves to be discover for those who want more than what they are told to watch.",
            "The film does maintain a powerful mood throughout, a kind of stringency, and the fate of the humans fades into insignificance as the film draws to a bleak close.",
            "It's a study of human weakness and cruelty, it's a portrait of Christ the suffering servant, it's the heartbreaking story of a young girl's descent from innocence to despair. But above all, it's a movie about a donkey. ",
            "Bresson's greatest masterpiece.",
            "A deft, impassioned, and wrenching film, but also - emphatically, absurdly - a film about a donkey. Indeed, it hardly pretends to be much more.",

            "The effect on her children of Susan Tom's call to serve and cherish is enthralling to behold, and My Flesh and Blood deeply honors her and her family.",

            "Whatever you make of this family, one thing is certain after watching My Flesh and Blood -- you won't forget them.",
            "The audience witnesses not only the incredible humor and joy and confidence that [Susan] has instilled in her children and the unanticipated turmoil the clan.",

            "You'd have to be a stone not to be affected by My Flesh and Blood, but the director, Jonathan Karsh, merges compassion with voyeurism until you can't tell the difference."

            "The intricate structure of the movie is well handled but its world is a stifling capsule. Dukakis is in a zone!",
            "Aggressively drab and granular, the movie feels like a late-'80s AIDS passion play given an ill-fitting post-Sept. 11 makeover.",
            "content with its own limited horizons",
            "Maybe part of the reason The Event works so well is that Fitzgerald doesn't have compassion only for people dying of AIDS; his compassion rings out for anyone who's dying, period, as well as for the families and friends who care for them.",
            "Dukakis has never been better and once again Fitzgerald proves himself to be a filmmaker of unfailing sensitivity, capable of transforming what could have been distastefully flip or overly lachrymose into something humorous but deeply heartfelt.",

            "This splendid film is no mere polemic, for Rakhshan Bani-Etemad, often called the first lady of Iranian cinema, is above all an accomplished storyteller and dramatist who understands the evocative power of sound and image.",
            "In the process of pushing the envelope of acceptance, Bani-Etemad carries off the neat trick of presenting an involving, beautifully cast film that portrays contemporary Iranian issues in a remarkably universal light.",
            "With understated skill and absolute authenticity, the film builds with enough layers that by its powerful ending, you'll feel as if you have been kicked in the stomach.",
            "Bani-Etemad's gift is her ability to make immediate the human struggle at the heart of a family caught in a time and place so unmoored from tradition that ritual has become cruelty.",

            "Distinguished, like so much contemporary Iranian cinema, by the way its striking visuals and strategic use of sound tell the underlying story.",
            "Bani-Etemad uses practical characters and somber camerawork to tell an inspirational tale and reveal the levels of sexism in Iran.",
            "Honored by Iranian film critics as the best film of 2001, and one can understand why without finding the film itself entirely satisfying in its voluble bleakness and expressionist despair.",
            "Bani-Etemad shows us Iranian family life from the perspective of a nuclear family, one that bears an uncomfortable resemblance to the ones we know and love.",
            "Rakhshan Bani-Etemad's social melodrama has a grim, eye-opening fascination in its details of inner-city Iran, but tends to beat us over the head with a sense of mission.",
            "The latest example of the brilliance evident in contemporary Iranian cinema.",
            "The plot has all the ingredients of a soap opera, but Bani-Etemad, who has been making movies since the '80s, is able to make it much more.",

            "The sobriety of the play has been preserved at the expense of the movie.",

            "What makes the movie work - to an admittedly limited extent - is the commitment of two genuinely engaging performers. Weaver and LaPaglia are both excellent, in the kind of low-key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk.",
            "Stands as a document of what it felt like to be a New Yorker -- or, really, to be a human being -- in the weeks after 9/11.",

            "The writing and directing team of twin brothers Alex and Andrew Smith have made an astonishingly good first feature.",
            "Having made his name as a ferocious, self-hating Jewish skinhead in The Believer, 22-year-old Ryan Gosling gives another memorable performance as a lonely, world-hating fatherless quarterback in The Slaughter Rule.",
            "As compellingly played by Morse, a great actor who gives pic more than it gives him, Gideon comes off as a sensitive soul who knows how risky it can be to appear too sensitive in a small town.",
            "The film's powerful meditation on masculinity gets much of its credibility and punch from the two leads, especially Morse, a reliable character actor who sinks his teeth into a role with heavy physical and psychological demands.",
            "David Morse, who's spent the last 20 years kicking around network television and building up an resume of impressive movie credits, establishes himself as a truly formidable presence in this powerful first feature by Alex and Andrew Smith.",
            "[Gosling] once again shows how magnetic he can be in challenging roles.",
            "Gosling and Morse give strong performances in this bitter pill movie.",
            "Everyone's got demons to deal with -- from Gideon's guilt over a kid that played for him and died under mysterious circumstances to the audience's unwillingness to sit through two hours of yet another inspirational football movie.",
            "Best movie I saw in 2002. Features a terrifyingly real performance by David Morse.",
            "Montana's wide-open spaces -- and the closed hearts of the people who live there -- make for a sincere, superbly acted story of loss and need.",
            "A timid template of an indie movie that glides through all the proper turns, sticks up all the appropriate signposts, and never once takes a demanding or truthful step.",
            "Writer-directors Andrew and Alex Smith go for emotional truth, but what they come up with is often silly.",
            "A keen and compassionate drama.",
            "Clear, cold and yet uniquely sensitive, The Slaughter Rule isn't a by-the-book flick, but that's what makes it so good.",
            "Unlike Terrence Malick, whose shadow looms over the film's visual style, the Smiths over-explain, not grasping that all those barren fields and blood-red clouds are doing plenty of work for them.",

            "Very much a mood piece, the film's deft balance of humor and poignancy makes it both a pleasurable and melancholy experience.",
            "With this film it becomes clear that Sofia Coppola is a filmmaker with eyes all her own.",
            "So far as the central relationship goes, the film is almost European in its subtlety and nuance. Cinematic cherry blossom.",
            "[Murray] can still do more with a raised eyebrow than anyone since Groucho Marx, but he's mellower and sometimes slightly poignant.",
            "Murray, playing an extension of himself, fills the role with ease, and Johansson is right in step with him.",
            "What Coppola presents is something akin to a mindfulness session - the art of being present in the moment.",
            "I can never remember the plot, but who cares. The emotional throughline is crystal clear.",
            "...its pretty images of Tokyo and oddball intergenerational friendship coalesce into something unexpectedly moving...",
            "Like her debut film, The Virgin Suicides, Coppola creates a beautiful-looking film with depth and texture, along with a couple of outstanding performances from its lead actors.",
            "Sofia Coppola's sophomore film (following the gently assured The Virgin Suicides) is another exploration of delicate relationships and uncommunicated frustrations, this one in a beautifully composed atmosphere of isolation.",
            "Depicts a very specific mental state too shaded and delicate for most movies to feel comfortable approaching it.",
            "Excellent but mature film about finding a connection.",
            "A relationship picture with elegant connective tissue; it's brittle and real, focused on the nuances of body language and unspoken desire, while indulging in a cheeky bit of knowing absurdity when the mood strikes.",
            "...a deceptively simple study in unrequited attraction that succeeds in spite of minor problems with neglected sub-plots.",
            "An excellent top notch gem with beautiful direction courtesy of Sofia Coppola...",
            "Wonderfully warm and witty.",
            "Transcends its initial culture clash comic riffs to evolve into something altogether more moving by the end. As a result, it's a work of considerable power and pathos.",
            "Working this time with her own story, Coppola lets it relax and breathe, devoting herself to moods and moments.",
            "This is another step in Mr. Murray's career and one that hopefully gets him the recognition he deserves.",
            "The whole tale is told with a dreamy, jet-lagged feel, that part wonder, part nasueous feeling brought about by significant travel. Jet lag as a metaphor for love, a delicious combination. Simply a must-see film.",
            "Alternately laugh-out-loud silly and profoundly moving, kudos to Sofia Coppola for managing to capture an undeniable chemistry between Murray and his 18 year-old co-star, despite a certain asexuality.",
            "Sofia Coppola's accomplished sophomore work is a personal, melancholy film, based on her own experience, and benefiting from strong chemistry between Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson."

            "The Last Samurai is an idyll in which the savageries of existence are transcended by spiritual devotion. That's a beautiful dream, and it gives the film a deep pleasingness, but the fullness of life and its blackest ambiguities are sacrificed.",
            "Zwick is attracted to the notions of victory in defeat and the romantic purity of self-sacrifice. His film is, however, a trifle earnest and overlong.",
            "Disappointingly content to recycle familiar attitudes about the nobility of ancient cultures, Western despoilment of them, liberal historical guilt, the unrestrainable greed of capitalists and the irreducible primacy of Hollywood movie stars.",
            "There are pleasures to be had in the handsome, heroic The Last Samurai. But they're all on the surface.",
            "The breathtaking showpiece skirmishes might well suggest a Braveheart set in Japan, but there is something more going on here than merely rolling out the battles.",
            "Mostly, though, The Last Samurai aims for, and achieves, epic sweep: the glory of tradition-bound warriors hurling themselves against the modern world, the grandeur of Hollywood offering two points of view on everything.",
            "does honor traditional Japanese culture and ideals and make them accessible to a wider audience",
            "Outstanding action and performance; lots of blood.",
            "One of the best films of 2003.",
            "More than anything else, \"The Last Samurai\" is the current Tom Cruise vehicle, and the actor's capacity to wrestle the story to his own demands is an impressive testament to his multifaceted perfectionist skills.",
            "The real point of the film seems to be the poster image of a battle-ready Tom Cruise waving a sword and all decked out in gleaming red-and-black samurai armor.",
            "It's a film at war with itself. Worse, it's a mixed bag of carefully packaged entertainment, with little room for spontaneity or surprise.",
            "Cruise is wasted on this American samurai tale. The movie is pretty to look at but lacks substance or intrigue.",
            "As brisk as it is rich, The Last Samurai is much more fun than a mere history lesson.",
            "Zwick has an ace up his sleeve, in addition to all the glorious scenery and pulse-pounding battles, and that's Ken Watanabe.",
            "A harrowing tale of honor, simple beauty, self-discovery, and ferocious conviction.",
            "It's Zwick who fails to take care of business here.",
            "Edward Zwick's The Last Samurai isn't an awful movie, but it is a dull and plodding epic that's rife with the usual Hollywood cliches.",
            "...one has to take into account is the sheer power of the show, the way The Last Samurai can sweep up the susceptible and the willing.",
            "The standout performance is Ken Watanabe as the charismatic Samurai leader, reminiscent of Yul Brynner in looks and demeanor."

            "Dreamworks animation has a lot to live up to after Shrek, but this wacky and high-spirited version of the Sinbad legend really isn't too bad.",
            "There's much to like here -- a gag-filled script, impressive visuals and Michelle Pfeiffer's classy villainess.",
            "Bland music, marquee-friendly casting and crassly contemporary dialogue give this film the mechanical feel of a marketing exercise, not a movie.",
            "Business-as-usual movie that isn't trying to make anything more than a medium-size splash.",
            "It's certainly not the worst of DreamWorks, but I can see why it has been basically forgotten.",
            "The quaintly hand-painted cityscapes of Syracuse are pretty. It would be nice if there was something going on in the foreground. ",
            "Fun, if standard, animated adventure with battles, innuendo.",
            "Despite its flaws, this is a fun well-acted piece of escapist fare with action, romance, adventure, and monsters galore.",
            "A visually exhilarating mix of hand-drawn and computer-generated images that sets sail with a rather mediocre and clich\u00e9d script.",
            "As routine as many live-action adventure films, right down to the competent but fairly undistinguished art and animation.",
            "Handily outdoes [Treasure Planet], with bravura action set pieces, a surprisingly complex romantic triangle, and thoughtful exploration of moral issues and character.",
            "While younger kids will enjoy the magic and adventure, the real mystery is whether older audiences will respond as well.",
            "Even the voices of Brad Pitt, Michelle Pfeiffer and Catherine Zeta-Jones can't save this movie from just feeling \"blah...\"",
            "It's a decent summer distraction for restless little ones, but not much more.",
            "For all of its freedom of movement, the film lacks real personality, and in parts, it's oddly serious-minded.",
            "... entertains and fully exploits all the accomplishments DreamWorks' animation department has made to this point... \"Sinbad\" stands as an accomplishment all on its own.",
            "This is not the kind of movie that keeps our hopes alive for a successful return of the standard animated feature.",
            "If you drag a gang along to this one, be prepared to make amends with a trip to Pirates of the Caribbean.",
            "Feature length films should no longer be hand drawn if the studios want the public to shell out fifty bucks to take the family to see them on the big screen.",
            "The kids will like its simplicity and manic motion, but if you want more than that, you won't find it here."

            "With all the hype about this film, one may expect a dark, cynical comedy with some sort of commentary on the mass consumerism of the season. Sadly, moments like that are few.",
            "I wanted to believe in Bad Santa. At least half of the time I did.",
            "Zwigoff's safe-cracking con-man Santa is one of vilest creatures to ever grace a screen."

            "The thunderous climax -one of the muddiest, bloodiest and most chaotic gunfights of the 2000s -makes it clear that Kevin Costner's plaintive, patient, slightly overlong Western was only sitting for a spell to race toward the finish. ",
            "Range is handed a stunning period scope by Costner's directorial eye, while forming an unexpectedly tender core to help endear these character past their grizzled exterior.",
            "An unbelievable old-fashioned western...",
            "Thoroughly enjoyable and involving, Kevin Costner's Open Range is a beautifully made western about flawed heroes who believe in redemption, loyalty and respect.",
            "Something like...It's a Wonderful Life, only rich in slaughter.",
            "Costner finds in the Western something grand, familiar and new within a genre that clearly has some life in it yet.",
            "While equally paying homage to directors Peckinpah, Eastwood, and Kurosawa, what makes Open Range special is that it's a love story, too. And one peopled by endearing characters we're inclined to care about when the bloodletting has finally ended.",
            "By the end, I was thinking this is probably one of the best westerns made since Kevin Costner first hopped on a horse in \"Silverado.\"",
            "Good for Costner: at the close of a summer cluttered with dumb action films, sequels and remakes, he's bucked the trend and put himself back in the saddle again.",
            "Open Range est tout simplement un bon vieux western qui fait plaisir \u00e0 voir.",

            "Matchstick Men glides from comedy to suspense to poignance, arriving at a destination you might not suspect...Fun while it lasts, but it's a bit of a con job itself.",
            "Matchstick Men never really casts off its cloak of artificiality and calculation; its pleasures are minor, however distracting they may be.",
            "Ridley Scott lets us enjoy the satisfying clicks and whirrs of the well-oiled celluloid con trick, while leaving plenty of head room for Cage to twitch and fret in.",
            "[Cage is] funny in his misery, because he has a natural air of exaggeration: he carries his own storm cloud with him, almost like a cartoon of the sad and lonely guys he played in Moonstruck and Raising Arizona.",
            "A thoroughly absorbing hour and 56 minutes of entertainment.",
            "Matchstick Men is really two movies brilliantly spliced into one, each enriching the other.",
            "Matchstick Men -- a nice strong balance of laughter and melodrama that envelops you like A Summer Wind.",
            "This is a movie about con games at every level.",
            "Nicholas Cage gives his best performance since \"Leaving Los Vegas\" as con man Roy Waller in this sophisticated movie about familial responsibility, self-imposed barriers and the possibilities of a well executed long con.",
            "A cleverly planned switcheroo story in which the twist at the end is the knife in the back.",
            "Scott tucks away his visual athletics in favour of something leisurely and quietly devastating. It's ultimately far more cunning a script than we can reveal here.",
            "Matchstick Men works because of the way the key players handle the material. This is the work of professionals acknowledging a good story and knowing better than to get in the way.",
            "Something less than the sum of its parts, Matchstick Men is a decent film that should have been a considerably better one.",
            "A lot more fun than most of the director's pompously inflated output.",
            "What saves Matchstick Men from being a complete washout are the performances by Cage, Sam Rockwell and Alison Lohman.",
            "Mathstick Men se compare ais\u00e9ment \u00e0 Catch Me If You Can sans atteindre la qualit\u00e9 de Ocean's Eleven.",
            "Despite its string of crime-caper clich\u00e9s, [director Ridley] Scott's focus on character and relationship helps the film transcend the typical mediocrity of its genre.",
            "Cage is absolutely terrific down to his eye twitches and neck jerks.",
            "Director Ridley Scott, whose recent history has brought us wonderful action films like Black Hawk Down and Gladiator, translates Eric Garcia's book about a neurotic con man into a compelling film.",
            "... tenuous and beautiful interaction between Cage and Lohman.",

            "A formulaic Hollywood 'crowd-pleaser' that can be summed up in three words ('Teenage James Bond!').",

            "The film's worth seeing for Charlize Theorn's stunning performance, based on complete physical and psychological transformation, but as a dramatic feature, it lacks an interesting perspective and is underpopulated in terms of characters.",
            "Charlize Theron gives her finest performance yet in the unlikely role of serial killer Aileen Wuornos in this riveting depiction of the Florida prostitute's decent into madness.",
            "Theron is the most convincing actress to play Aileen Wuornos ever and really dives into the role...",
