            "It's too bad that Pakula allows this 1993 movie to dawdle after its climax, but prior to that he's adept at suggesting unseen menace and keeping things in motion.",
            "Pakula has improved on Grisham's book by excising much of the detritus, crafting a taut, intelligent thriller that succeeds on almost every level.",
            "An old hand at this sort of thing, Pakula goes through the motions, but not much more.",
            "As the film piles on shovelfuls of further exposition, Mr. Washington and Ms. Roberts are left to look terrific and recite perfunctory lines.",
            "A brightly wrapped, ketchup-drenched mush-burger, it slides down the Zeitgeist esophagus like a slippery McPelican. You pay, you swallow, you drive home. You're left with nothing except, possibly, heartburn.",
            "Not on par with Alan J. Pakula's preeminent paranoid cinema. But depicting a POTUS at odds with his FBI director and creating obstruction of justice concerns aligns it with Pakula's other preternaturally predictive potboilers.",
            "Both Roberts, with her intense fragility, and Washington, with his thoughtful heroism, prove invaluable in pulling us into the heart of the film.",
            "It all sounds thrilling enough. So why is it so dull? Chiefly because of a central flaw in Grisham's writing, which Hollywood is unable to smooth out -- its grinding pedantry.",
            "A juicy conspiracy theory thriller.",
            "A routine thriller, curiosuly disappointing from Alan Pakula that even stars like Denzel Washington and Julia Roberts can't rescue",
            "Talky political thriller won't engage kids.",
            "If I would still call it one of Pakula's very best films since the end of the 1970s, that says far more about the decline of his career than anything else.",
            "If only The Pelican Brief were purposefully controversial.",
            "A shallow bore.",
            "This is a standard Grisham pot-boiler.",
            "You'd think that Pakula would be just the man to tease the intellectual and emotional depth out of a Grisham potboiler, but you'd be wrong. [Blu-ray]",
            "A curiously disappointing thriller from Alan Pakula, reaffirming the notion that John Gresham's best-selling novels are more fun to read (at the airport) than watch on the big screen, even if they star Denzel Washington and Julia Roberts.",
            "Definitely an easy rental and a good way to drown a couple of hours if you're looking for a little suspense, some law stuff, lotsa secondary players and a couple of renowned leads delivering the goods.",

            "Generously exciting, In the Line of Fire is mercifully free of that artificial energy that makes so many new movies look as if they were created with steroids.",
            "Petersen directs his film in a straightforward, workmanlike fashion-few surprises here -- and, curiously, for most of the film is better at establishing a kind of amiability than a hard tension.",
            "Director Wolfgang Petersen moves the story along, but his real job is to simply stay out of the way of his two racehorse lead actors. And he does.",
            "Every part of this film trades so heavily on Eastwood's presence that it is impossible to imagine it with anyone else in the starring role.",
            "The movie has a clear, simple thriller logic that's far more satisfying than the static variations-on-a-massacre construction of Eastwood's Dirty Harry pictures and spaghetti Westerns.",
            "Despite the presence of all these action-flick cliches, In the Line of Fire works. Sure, it's no more than a formula movie, but it's an effective formula movie.",
            "John Malkovich plays one of the screen's most memorable and often underrated villains.",
            "...a seriously superior thriller that remains, more than 20 years later, one of the best examples of the genre.",
            "Directed by Wolfgang Petersen, In the Line of Fire builds a palpable tension between the Eastwood and Malkovich characters.",
            "It just builds, relationship by relationship, detail by detail, clever stroke by clever stroke, taking you in and making you its own. It ought to wear a sign: Danger. Professionals At Work.",
            "What separates In The Line Of Fire from the rest of the bog-standard good-guy/bad-guy set-up is the clear implication throughout that these two sworn enemies have more in common than they may think.",
            "Eerie assassin and protector are perfectly balanced in this classy entertainment.",
            "Preposterous but still thoroughly involving, this tense, kinetic, ingenious thriller is the thinking fan's action movie.",
            "How fitting that in this summer of dinosaurs, Clint Eastwood has again emerged as the most interesting thing on screen.",
            "Between them, director Petersen and screenwriter Jeff Maguire do a memorable job developing their characters in this story of personal and professional redemption.",
            "[Peterson] keeps his new film hopping at a lively pace, and he shows sensitivity to the look and feel of American politics.",
            "If you don't care about such motivations, this is a pretty good thriller, though not one you're likely to remember for very long.",
            "Petersen piles on the suspense with ruthless skill, while Eastwood reveals the same vulnerability that made his performance in Unforgiven so compelling and convincing.",
            "For the most part, this is an exciting, engaging thriller, well-directed by Wolfgang Petersen.",
            "Feverish suspense is at work in In the Line of Fire, a film of surprising depth for an action thriller. The felicitous interweaving of humor and high drama is another hallmark of this tense story of wits.",
            "Clint Eastwood has always been an old man. Even in the '60s, as the gunslinger in Sergio Leone westerns, Eastwood had the squinty eyes, sour mouth and weary walk of a soldier who had been in too many wars.",
            "[A] shallow but well assembled thriller.",
            "In the Line of Fire explores this intriguing premise with subtlety and suspense, particularly during several phone conversations between a gloating, you-can't-stop-me Leary and a visibly shaken Horrigan. ",
            "One of the more rugged and enjoyable examples of how early-'90s mainstream cinema worked when it was being made sensibly and effectively."

            "Hallstrom finds the right bittersweet tone for his dysfunctional family tale (and one of Hollywood's few films about obesity), marvelously acted by Johnny Depp and particularly Leonardo DiCaprio in his second outing as a retarded adolescent.",

            "Definitely a remarkable story, but as told by Miller it isn't really an uplifting one.",
            "Miller imbues the film with such emotional intensity and conviction that you can't help but get caught up in their plight, cheering them on through every obstacle even as we recognize that whatever victory they may attain can only be partial.",
            "Miller finds humor and horror in medical politics. And, with surgical resolve, he cuts to the emotional quick: the drama is heartrending.",

            "It's a good thing this breezy animated adventure lasts only slightly more than 70 minutes. Children will no doubt enjoy its simple tale, but would probably grow restless if it went on for a minute longer.",
            "Respect for nature and the environment is a message that no one would quarrel with, but this is yet another example of a movie that can't or won't differentiate between technology and the use to which it is put.",
            "The characters are not memorable; the songs are lame and the drawing style is pedestrian.",
            "It contains a dire message: Man is destroying nature and progress is evil. It is hard to know what small children, the film's intended audience, are supposed to do with this idea. Nag their parents about recycling? Work it out in nightmares?",
            "While an agreeable enough effort in most respects, pic is a bit dark and somber to be terrifically appealing to kids, and could have used bigger doses of humor and music.",
            "Makes one long for animals whacking each other with sticks of dynamite.",
            "A pleasing, sweet primer in caring for our flora and fauna.",
            "For all the feeling the drawing instills in the figures, it might be termed inanimation.",
            "From the first moments of Once Upon a Forest, there is evidence of high artistic standards. The backgrounds are beautifully detailed, right down to the shading and contours of a tree trunk.",
            "Sadly, in common with so many non-Disney cartoons, the standard of the songs is poor and the animation lacks magic.",
            "While the movie's lip-synchronization leaves much to be desired, the creatures great and small are nicely conceived, the settings a vivid eyeful and the ecology lesson sound.",
            "Sounds good in practice but with a plot where very little happens and songs that really shouldn't have been included, sticking the kids in front of David Attenborough sounds much more appealing.",
            "Even at its preachiest, the circus-bright colors and bouncy songs keep the sermonizing and the saccharine content under control.",
            "The film rarely gets past familiar gimmicks of the cartoon-adventure genre, and the animation isn't very inspired.",
            "In this likable fable about growing up, learning teamwork and developing courage, three small creatures who dwell in Dapplewood, an idyllic forest, go on a far-flung quest for healing herbs to save the life of a dying friend.",
            "The latest subpar G-rated animated feature to prey upon of parents in search of suitable entertainment for their kids.",
            "Once Upon a Forest has a good heart -- I liked the way it treated its themes -- but the movie is kind of dumb.",
            "Even children can't help but be bored by the movie's shadowless, textureless, weightless style of animation.",
            "Dismally unimaginative, this 72-minute cartoon will be excruciating for anyone endowed with judgment.",
            "There is nothing really engaging about this latest effort from the creator of An American Tale and Hanna-Barbera.",
            "On its own terms, the fairy tale sensibility works perfectly in context -- and the film is most enjoyable for children and their parents."

            "As the grand ringmaster, it's here that Altman passes the baton to his actors , whose behavioral insights are critical to the film's success.",
            "Inevitably it's a mixed bag, though the film's assurance in keeping it all coherent is at times exhilarating.",
            "From the exhilarating opening, you know Altman's epic 'adaptation' of eight stories and a poem by Raymond Carver is going to be special.",
            "The lives are often desperate and the characters inarticulate, but the group portrait is as grandly, sometimes as hilariously, realized as anything the director has ever done.",
            "Triumphantly fierce, funny, moving and innovative.",
            "A movie of Carver's work needed to show this process whereby simple acts and objects are also abstractions. Altman has shown it...",
            "Whether their characters are congenial, contemptible or just absurd, Altman gets the best from an extraordinary company.",
            "Worth the buy for one scene: watching a young Robert Downey, Jr. elbow-punch a couch.",
            "We are never made to care much about the afflicted characters because Altman doesn't and thereby the stories carry very little weight.",
            "The epidosic (by necessity) movie is uneven, but some of the stories are poignant and the acting always compelling",
            "Performances are low key but accomplished, comedy and tragedy are delicately balanced and the whole thing has the feel of a sprawling but very absorbing soap.",
            "Cool, clever and complex, Altman succeeds in bringing out the best from a highly talented cast.",
            "The film is fascinating and complex, and benefits from a densely textured soundtrack that makes it as interesting to listen to as to watch.",
            "Not prime Altman, but weaves an interesting path due to many sub-plots.",
            "Altman weaves magic from Carver's character-rich material.",
            "An absolutely brilliant, 3-hour examination of detached, dysfunctional behavior in modern America. Easily one of Altman's best films.",
            "Robert Altman revisited Nashville territory, and surpassed it, with this 1993 masterpiece."

            "Though visually impressive and assured, it is the hollowest of successes, all chic set design, smug posturing and self-satisfied attitude.",
            "Few films understand the value of gender as a spectacle better than Orlando.",
            "Despite my misgivings about book-to-film adaptations, Sally Potter's \"Orlando\" impressed the hell out of me. It's opulent, cheeky, and fun as hell. Woolf would be proud.",
            "Unlike anything onscreen this month or this year, Orlando is serious, provocative and sometimes funny fare. Novelist Virginia Woolf might well be pleased.",
            "Writer-director Sally Potter's film, based on the classic Virginia Woolf novel, is a lyrical history lesson on the nature of sexual politics.",

            "Sumptuous and witty book-to-screen treatment for Virginia Woolf's novel, with graceful and ambitious direction by Sally Potter.",
            "Reminiscent of the low-budget lushness of the early films of Peter Greenaway and Ken Russell, Orlando could turn out to be the art-house smash of the summer.",
            "Potter possesses a natural gracefulness in presentation that helps a little but, finally, not nearly enough. Orlando is vague when she means it to be mysterious, coy when it ought to be witty, familiar when it should be bold.",
            "See Orlando for its fabulous costumes, fascinating look at changing eras, and impressive performance by Tilda Swinton. Viewing this film for other reasons will almost certainly lead to a negative impression.",
            "It wanders from the frozen London of the 1600s to the battlefields of World War I and has fun all the way. You haven't seen anything like it.",
            "Compared with Potter's bold, beautiful, original, and witty first feature, The Gold Diggers, this is safe, crowd-flattering stuff, the Driving Miss Daisy of art pictures -- a film with practically no ideas at all, but lots of fancy trimmings.",
            "What it perhaps lacks in content, the film more than makes up for in its stunning design and accesible, humorous approach.",
            "Written and directed by Sally Potter, Orlando takes a droll approach to subject matter usually attended by the utmost solemnity.",
            "Sally Potter has made a beautiful, if decidedly wobbly, movie out of Virginia Woolfs novel about a 16th-century nobleman who evolves, across some 400 years, into a modern woman in her mid-30s. Swinton plays both male and female Orlando with cool humor.",
            "It seems just as fresh, spry and quirky now as it did back then.",
            "Suffocatingly beautiful, Orlando is a precious trifle whose literary pedigree intimidated audiences into ignoring its sublime silliness.",
            "Tilda Swinton's performance as Orlando in this adaptation of Virginia Woolf's novel is luminous and thrilling, an omnisexual romp through 400 years of history.",
            "It is a time-tripping, gender-bending fantasia with a cunning feminist edge, featuring the strikingly androgynous Tilda Swinton in the title role."

            "Father Hood isn't so much undemanding as vapid, disjointed rather than antic. And if this film is a romp, then so is bearbaiting.",
            "Despite its best intentions, Father Hood is destined to become leftovers in the video store.",
            "It does suggest, ultimately, that if more wards of the state would run off to join their fathers on cross-country crime sprees, we could lick these corrupt foster-care and inattentive-dad problems.",
            "The movie develops a hopelessly split personality.",
            "A train wreck from start to finish.",
            "Basically adequate yet completely forgettable...",
            "If Swayze's performance is thin, that's nothing compared to the vapid logic that propels Father Hood.",
            "While not a classic, Father Hood does offer a fairly exciting crime spree neutered into fun for the entire family.",
            "A story of mixed messages that focuses on contempt for the law, legal authority and public safety, it attempts to garner sympathy -- and, unfortunately, laughs -- during a violent cross-country pursuit.",
            "The terrible problem with \"Father Hood\" is that no one involved seemed to have any idea of what kind of movie it should be, and one feels their conflicting visions at play throughout.",
            "Ah yes, the Patrick Swayze family comedy.",
            "There is little to relieve the tedium of this film, except an impressive performance by little-known actress Sabrina Lloyd.",
            "Father Hood is a genial, simple-minded chase picture in which a small time thief learns to love his children. I didn't believe a single second of it, although I enjoyed a few of them.",
            "While TV and movie trailers promise a rollicking road movie for the whole family, it is, in fact, a plodding guide to reckless child endangerment.",
            "I guess we're supposed to like Swayze's character because, at heart, he's a good guy who only robs drug dealers and tells his kids to buckle up their seatbelts when he's driving so as to elude police."

            "The plot seems expressly designed to placate the bureaucrats who banned Zhang's two previous films in China, but the quasi-documentary approach (involving scores of non-professional actors, hidden cameras and radio mikes) is brilliantly finessed.",
            "\"The Story of Qui Ju\" reaffirms Zhang Yimou's stature as storyteller and sociologist extraordinaire, and as a visual artist of exceptional delicacy and insight.",
            "There is a point in the film when it begins to seem repetitive: The leader will remain unbending, the Qui Ju will keep appealing. Then we begin to connect with the underlying story of the film.",
            "It's hardly a threat to the antics of \"Naked Gun\" but it's a delicately wry take on the absurdities of bureaucratic life. It upends Zhang's resume wonderfully.",
            "\"The Story of Qiu Ju\" has its bawdy pleasures, but it's far too litigious to be especially entertaining, and is at its best in its documentary mode.",
            "This is the first film I have seen from China that has at once such documentary verisimilitude, such comic inventiveness, and such reflective strength.",
            "For its glimpses into the quotidian realities of the huge, emerging superpower, this story proves worth watching, despite its obliqueness, its repetitiousness and the slowness of its perpetual voyages to the city and back again.",
            "Utilizando a montagem de forma precisa para estabelecer o ritmo da vida de seus personagens, Yimou narra uma hist\u00f3ria bem-humorada e reveladora sobre a China contempor\u00e2nea, sendo auxiliando por Gong Li em um de seus melhores desempenhos.",
            "Sparks of genius already apparent.",
            "One of Zhang Yimou's finest moments.",
            "Mesmerizing Chinese film about a woman who is zealous for justice",
            "This stunningly photographed film is also quite ironic, complete with an O. Henry-style twist at the end - but its reach is universal, as it says something about pride and respect."

            "The film ends as more of a dirge than a ballad. But occasionally it casts a forlorn spell. The meaning of Jo Monaghan's life may not really emerge in this film but its mystery lingers.",
            "This is more skillful than inspired, with an image of the early west that seems largely borrowed from McCabe and Mrs. Miller.",
            "Ultimately, what makes \"The Ballad of Little Jo\" worthy is Amis' full-bodied performance in what may be her most challenging role to date. Always believable, Amis never makes a false move.",
            "The mud and desperation of the frontier is vividly rendered, but the film is marred by a lack of emotional drama.",
            "It's not hard to view \"The Ballad of Little Jo\" as an allegorical critique of sex and power and men's-club values in America. In its disdain for those values, the film is as focused and cool-headed as the remarkable character whose story it tells.",
            "A feminist western from fringe filmmaker Maggie Greenwald, this intriguing if rough-hewn drama is as ruthless in its revisionism as \"Unforgiven.\"",
            "Unitl its weirdly surreal ending, Little Jo proves a long, earnest, rather arid ride. Its life on screen here looks to be even shorter than that of Butterfly.",
            "Though the screenplay is based on the life of a real person, there are nonetheless moments when the basic premise seems stretched very thin, especially given Amis' fine-boned features.",
            "Well-realized feminist parable about a daring and creative young woman's survival in the Old West.",
            "The writer and director, Maggie Greenwald, wisely avoids an old-fashioned plot, and concerns herself more with the daily texture of life in the West.",
            "Underneath the collective mediocrity ... there is something unpretentiously appealing. Perhaps it comes from what the movie is trying to be."

            "The film presents an outward view of the inner life of a young black woman-of a person who, by the fact of those three descriptors, is subjected to relations of power and control.",
            "It's more of a harbinger of better things to come than a solid achievement in its own right, but it's moving in a fresh, invigorating direction.",
            "Just Another Girl on the I.R.T. is a film to be enjoyed for its individual moments, Ariyan Johnson's winning charm as Chantel and the fact that Harris has put the spotlight on the girls who too often are just bystanders in other inner-city movies.",
            "Stylishly shot and fast-paced, its hip-hop soundtrack features a host of women rappers, and its dialogue is heavy with attitude and body punctuation.",
            "What's exciting about this movie is a lot of loose details: frank girl talk about AIDS and birth control, glancing observations about welfare lines and the advantages of a boy with a car over one with subway tokens.",
            "What's especially encouraging about Just Another Girl is that in it Leslie Harris demonstrates a genuine knack for capturing on film the sounds and rhythms of adolescence.",
            "A little rough around the edges, but it's hard to dislike a movie with a strong, confident female protagonist and a frank attitude toward sex. Ariyan Johnson slays.",
            "This jiving, sassy debut draws comparisons with Spike Lee's She's Gotta Have It. Harris lacks Lee's wit, but also his cloying romanticism.",
            "It's rough and sometimes raw to visit with, blending sharp insights into the world of inner-city youth with a weakness for melodrama and touches of silly humor. But to see it is to visit a world rarely touched by mainstream movies.",
            "It's a low-budget winner combining a sharp, protean visual style -- one minute music video, the next cinema verite -- with impudent humour, raw emotion, a thumping good rap soundtrack and some pertinent lessons in choice and responsibility.",
            "Terrific slice-of-life stuff, by turns funny and sad, with Ariyan Johnson excellent as an ordinary New York high-school student who's determined to better herself.",
            "In the closing credits, Harris describes her picture as \"the movie Hollywood dared not make.\" Yet Harris seems to have adopted the Hollywood approach to glossing over tragic social problems.",
            "Johnson makes Chantel so vivid with life, so utterly without artifice, she draws you in and makes you believe, not only in Chantel's self but in her soul.",
            "Remove the swearing and the hip-hop soundtrack and it would make a fine after-school special.",
            "Although the film is punched up by some energetic cutting and hip-hop music, many dialogue scenes, particularly early on, are badly written and awkwardly staged.",
            "A ragged, uneven feature debut by a women director about a new type of screen heroine, a young, feisty African-American woman who's not entirely sympathetic.",
            "One could dwell on Johnson's in-your-face performance, or how refreshing it is to see a black New York drama played out by homegirls. But, facing facts, the climax is unpersuasive and the happy end a cop-out.",
            "Just another slice of life film that gets derailed.",
            "A fresh and often well-observed film with a convincing central performance by Johnson.",
            "The movie is far from being a failure, but because it misses achieving the complete success promised earlier, the disappointment is greater.",
            "well-intentioned, but unconvincing melodrama",
            "While the message of the film is as old as human society, the method of its presentation is new enough to make the movie worthwhile.",
            "In Just Another Girl on the I.R.T., Ariyan Johnson seizes the camera's attention like no other performer since John Travolta strutted into Saturday Night Fever.",
            "Just Another Girl on the I.R.T. ultimately offers a welcome glimpse of one of the individuals behind the sea of faces racing by in the subway cars -- the kind of face and individual that Hollywood customarily has never given a second look."

            "Crowe is powerful and terrifying, and the erotic chemistry between Pollock and McKenzie is no less intense and enriched by strong performances by both.",

            "A genuinely excellent film, horrifying and touching and beautiful in a bloody sort of way. A bit like real life, really."

            "It's what Hollywood wanted Woo for: bigger, brighter explosions.",
            "Presenting Mr. Van Damme as reverentially as Sergio Leone did the young Clint Eastwood, Mr. Woo displays a real aptitude for malignant mischief, which is this story's stock in trade.",
            "Even when the acting is hammy, notably Wilford Brimley's turn as Chance's Cajun uncle, Woo stages every fight with hypnotic grace.",
            "Essentially, Hard Target is a risk-averse Van Damme vehicle, steered by many hands, and set on tracks leading directly to the delivery entrances of the country's video stores.",
            "The most satisfying entry in Van Damme's rise to glory during the early 1990s, smartly using the star's limited vocabulary and limitless flexibility to create one of the finest B-movies of the decade.",
            "With its expert use of dissolves and pans, Hard Target is an arty shot of adrenaline to this overworked genre.",
            "This is Woo's American debut and it's not as individualistic as his Hong Kong gangster films, but there's also less of his sentimentality and corny humour. The performances are more consistent too.",
            "Though it lacks the epic feel and melodramatic sincerity of Woo's Oriental movies, this is nevertheless first-rate action.",
            "Though working on a Jean-Claude Van Damme vehicle can be seen as a comedown for Woo, he rises to the occasion to create an often rousing entertainment that is almost inarguably Van Damme's best film to date.",

            "It is still a remarkable portrait of the fisherman's life, with its craft and dedication, and of people whose ravaged, hopeful faces speak to us across the years.",
            "Visually spectacular documentary, one of Welles' sympathetic looks at countries around the world, their life and culture.",
            "It's an amazing film for how it shows the Hollywood studio system couldn't tolerate creative artists.",
            "Is this really a 'lost masterpiece'? I doubt it, but it's still and important missing piece of Welles' filmography.",
            "If only a documentary like this one existed for every unfinished Welles film.",
            "...the film at once seems like a visually dynamic conflation of a Robert Flaherty film and a proto-neorealist fable comprised of photogenic locals and working class heroics.",
            "It's definitely all true, but it's not all that interesting.",
            "It's All True is an essential piece in the Welles puzzle.",
            "Because Welles is arguably the most magnetic and mercurial of all American directors, the film would be interesting on any grounds, but it is also impressive because of the long raft sequence, shown here in an essentially complete state.",
            "A short, rather unsatisfying film about Welles's misadventures in Latin America at the start of World War II."

            "While Murray's deadpan putdowns and dry dismissals of provincial peccadilloes are the comic highlights, Groundhog Day is no supercilious rip of small-town U.S.A.",

            "Jim Sheridan tells his gripping tale with a fury that stokes up an audience the way early Costa Gavras movies used to do.",
            "Daniel Day-Lewis is remarkable.",
            "In the Name of the Father is a model of this kind of engaged, enraged filmmaking, a politically charged Fugitive that uses one of the most celebrated cases of recent British history to steamroller an audience with the power of rousing, polemical cinema.",
            "At every point, Day-Lewis is at the center of the story, and he carries the film with an impassioned performance. It helps that it's a great part.",
            "The picture turns into a kind of stylized morality play about the right and the wrong ways for Irishmen to respond to distorted portraits of their character, and it's terrifically effective.",
            "Day-Lewis, so intricately repressed in The Age of Innocence, here offers a role reversal in an unreserved and emotional performance that throws caution and inhibition to the winds.",
            "In the Name of the Father is a deeply stirring film that lessens the moral authority of the I.R.A., English soldiers in Ireland, the British police and the British government.",
            "If Sheridan didn't feel the need to pile on the pedantic subtexts, this would be an absorbing personal drama, rather than a vituperative, question-begging broadside.",
            "This is a stirring and exceptionally well acted, though controversial, dramatisation of Gerry Conlon's book about the grave miscarriage of justice suffered by the Guildford Four.",
            "Day-Lewis outdoes his acclaimed performance in My Left Foot, making Gerry a character of palpable realness and complexity.",
            "In this powerful, Oscar-nominated movie, Jim Sheridan infuses a fact-based social injustice drama with a more intimate family tale of estranged father and son, splendidly played by Daniel Day-Lewis and Peter Postlethwaite.",
            "Sheridan takes a controversial subject and gives it wider appeal by focusing on the family drama of two men who are also political prisoners.",
            "The complicated relationship between the rebellious Gerry and the quietly tormented Giuseppe is one focus of the film. The obvious political implications of the dreadful situation are another.",
            "By the end of the movie, whether or not you're a member of Sinn Fein, the Brits' brutality toward the Conlons will get your Irish up.",
            "[Sheridan] works with such piercing fervor and intelligence that In the Name of the Father just about transcends its tidy moral design.",
            "Miscarried justice often provides the vehicle for emotionally wrenching drama and histrionic fireworks, and such is the case in spades with In the Name of the Father.",
            "Letter-perfect performances from Day-Lewis and Postlethwaite do a lot more than a dozen editorials to make an unforgettable point about the miscarriage of justice.",
            "Director Sheridan chronicles the father-son relationship perfectly and also handles the courtroom confrontations skilfully without ever falling into movie melodramatics.",
            "The acting's so good it frequently transcends the simplicities of the script, and whenever Day-Lewis or Postlethwaite is on-screen the movie crackles.",
            "Sheridan's movie seeks to engage and enrage. It's not, however, a film with an ideological axe to sharpen, but one which unfolds, with a sense of passionate conviction, a story of injustice.",
            "Passionate true-story about an Irish youth who was wrongfully convicted of a terrorist act."

            "\"Carlito's Way\" is best watched as lively, colorful posturing and as a fine demonstration of this director's bravura visual style.",
            "Pacino has his moments but for the most part he's surprisingly underwhelming. He's a great actor but even I can do a better Puerto Rican accent.",
            "About halfway through, the overwhelming fact that the movie is a complete nothing becomes too much to ignore.",
            "\"Carlito's Way,\" like \"Scarface,\" is first and last a character study, a portrait of a man who wants to be better than he is.",
            "Carlito's sincerity, severity, and confidence - matched once again with the poetry of lavish tumult - are thoroughly engaging.",
            "The film's somber mood is balanced only by its larger-than-life performances, retro '70s threads, thrilling sequences, and plenty of sweaty disco tunes outside of Patrick Doyle's stellar score. ",
            "Carlito's Way, Brian De Palma's return to the dangerous, violent world of Latino crime, marks yet another advance in the remarkable second act of Al Pacino's career.",
            "You expect a fine performance from Pacino, and, with hopeless, hollowed-out eyes, he gives it. You expect the worst from Sean Penn. But, here, he's a hit.",
            "Although still distinctly sleek a la de Palma, it's the rare instance in which romantic optimism & warm, careful character observation trump his penchant for coolly detached cynicism. It's not nihilistic, fetishistic or misogynistic. It's humanistic.",
            "Perhaps the last great DePalma film, using his trademarks well but not overusing them.",
            "Beautifully shot and extremely well acted, Carlito's Way is not only a great crime movie but is also a tragic story of redemption, as one man tries to escape the ghost's of his past and start again. ",
            "A lengthy cat-and-mouse chase scene at the film's climax practically surpasses Hitchcock and even gives Scorsese's GoodFellas a run for its money.",
            "As with so many De Palma films, Carlito's Way soon manifests as an essay on its own forms.",
            "A great story told by a master filmmaker; sterling actors playing some truly fascinating characters; and a bunch of cinematic set-pieces that are worthy of repeat viewings.",
            "Stronger in its suspense and action elements than in its dramatic moments.",
            "The film is a redundancy and only those who have played Brian De Palma's other movies so much they've memorized the dialogue are going to be interested. Al Pacino portrays a reformed gangster trying to break away from his earlier lifestyle. Needless to sa",

            "Layering this sweet comedic story with some sharp, editorial barbs, screenwriter Gary Ross has fashioned an engaging, brainy comedy. ",
            "It's the spritely comic timing of the fine Hollywood ensemble that keeps Dave percolating. This affable, well-built comedy is Reitman's best since Ghostbusters.",
            "A genial, expertly played political comedy proves that the spirit of Mr. Smith still lives.",
            "It's impossible to say whether Dave will play as wonderfully over the decades as it does right now, but this smooth-as-silk comedy could not be more timely, or connect more hopefully with our current national consciousness.",
            "While it's sloppy and draggy in parts, Kevin Kline, in the title role, delivers an ingratiating comedic performance.",
            "Kline is so polished and resourceful that he can glide his way through even the creakiest bits and make them seem fresh.",
            "\"Dave\" is the very model of a modern Capraesque comedy, being the story of a little guy who triumphs, through pluck and luck, over a corrupt system. ",
            "It's a high-concept premise that's employed to watchable yet erratic effect by Ivan Reitman...",
            "Paying an homage to the prior work of the great Frank Capra, Dave offers a fresh contemporary take on a classic trope.",
            "It's opportunistic, superficial, and great fun.",
            "[A] delightful, gentle satire on the Washington political scene.",
            "Dave isn't too careful about filling plot holes. It does a pretty fair job, however, of making jokes at the expense of the D.C. political scene.",
            "As Kline begins to take his presidential duties seriously, the comedy seeps out, a listless civic-mindedness drifts in like fog off the Potomac.",
            "Despite the familiar echoes, the film works more often than it should. Without the charming Kevin Kline in two roles, plot problems would yawn like sinkholes.",
            "Though replete with amusing situations and clever lines, its strongest suit is the delicately pitched comic performances of its actors, most especially star Kevin Kline.",
            "After the promisingly nasty beginning, the filmmakers settle into a sort of campaign mode, lulling and flattering the audience with a fairy-tale vision of the common man's victory over the Washington establishment.",
            "Despite its predictability this is one of director Reitman's best films, a gentle satire which provides Kline with one of his most likeable characters.",
            "Kline gives a tremendously likable performance as the ersatz president, and Sigourney Weaver brings charm and elegance to the role of First Lady who's as ignorant of the switcheroo as the rest of the country.",
            "Reitman keeps coming up with bouncy new directions to take the somewhat predictable material, greatly helped by Kline's bounce.",
            "Dave has been directed by Ivan Reitman in a refreshingly restrained fashion -- there are plenty of quiet passages, rare for American movies these days -- which compliments Kevin Kline's wonderful work as well.",
            "It's a beautifully proportioned, wonderfully complete movie.",
            "...an affable, good-natured comedy, thanks to its stars and director, who never push it too far beyond gentle political and social satire and light romance.",
            " For all its modest charm, Dave is a true throwback to the Capra days, a political comedy just cockeyed enough to triumph over cynicism.",
            "Pleasant comedy for older kids and up."

            "Call something a \"real train wreck\" and it's considered a put-down. Not in this fast-track, no-stops chase movie with a massive train-wreck scene that's going to have audiences scrambling for cover.",
            "Working from a tight script by Jeb Stuart and David Twohy, director Andrew Davis has fashioned a crackling, intelligent thriller.",
            "The film is little more than a well-oiled machine that serves a strictly limited function, but like a precision timepiece, it is a thing to marvel at, even under close scrutiny.",
            "For dynamite suspense loaded with thrills and wicked fun, you can't beat The Fugitive.",
            "I've already seen The Fugitive twice. I'll probably see it again.",
            "Thoroughly engaging, edge-of-the-seat entertainment.",
            "The fugitive and his pursuer are both given attention by the script, which is careful to develop characters that are intelligent, insightful, and, most of all, entertaining.",
            "It's a film that uses its spectacle to set up its characters, rather than to pay off its stakes.",
            "Led by two stellar performances, The Fugitive has certainly managed to withstand the test of time.",
            "For the majority of moviegoers born after the last episode, The Fugitive will be entirely new. But for both groups, this should be a highly satisfactory action picture, one that crowns Davis as this summer's new reigning master of the genre.",
            "In many ways The Fugitive represents the pinnacle of a genre not much in style any more: the suspense/action picture.",
            "Directed for maximum impact by Andrew Davis, this contains enough suspenseful set-pieces, clever red herrings and spectacular stuntwork to satisfy most thriller aficionados, yet what really makes the movie work are the performances by Ford and Jones.",
            "An action film heavyweight and purely excellent masterpiece...",
            "Andrew Davis provides some memorable set-pieces in this impressive adaptation of the '60s TV series.;",
            "Just when you thought the movies had been given over to special effects departments and the high-tech fantasies that sustain them, along comes The Fugitive -- a good, old-fashioned drama with unsettling shivers of suspense.",
            "Ford is fine as the innocent surgeon who is wrongfully convicted of the murder of his wife and sets off to find the real killer. But the movie is stolen from under his nose by Tommy Lee Jones, who gives an Oscar-winning performance.",
            "No fewer than six editors stitched his shots together, giving the most hard-hitting scenes a furious rhythm that contributes greatly to their impact.",
            "The Fugitive runs hard and true the whole way through.",
            "A sparkling suspense picture.",
            "The film treats this profoundly preposterous plot as if it were a serious idea.",
            "While there are actors in this film, there isn't much room for acting. The rapid editing and near-absence of dialogue reduces the actors to action figures with colorful labels pasted on their foreheads.",
            "The Fugitive is a super-adrenalized stemwinder, a crisp and jolting melodrama that screws the tension so pitilessly tight it does everything but squeak.",
            "It's a pleasure to find a thriller fulfilling its duties with such gusto: the emotions ring solid, the script finds time to relax into backchat, and for once the stunts look like acts of desperation rather than shows of prowess.",
            "Heart-pounding thriller with great acting."

            "Somehow, the new production fails to sustain the creepy, kooky, mysterious, spooky and altogether ooky visual sweep that held the first film together.",

            "Surprise, surprise -- Addams Family Values is more wicked, more warped and more tightly wound than The Addams Family. It's a dark comedy on the edge, way on the edge, and perhaps twice as funny as the original.",
            "Though this sequel probably has more creative energy than its predecessor, the constant stream of one-liners and sight gags is very much hit or miss.",
            "Addams Family Values turns out to be both a trick and a treat.",
            "This sequel to the 1990 picture contains some funny scenes and witty one-liners.",

            "Spielberg ultimately remains Spielberg, finding his enduring themes within Thomas Keneally's novel and giving them the full Spielberg treatment.",
            "For this film Spielberg has done the best directing of his career. Much of his previous work has been clever and some of it better than that, but Schindler's List is masterly.",

            "With its black-and-white bleakness and its fiercely insistent realism, Schindler's List is a hallucinogenic experience. It is one of the most finely calibrated, most overtly mournful, most nakedly authentic films ever made.",
            "...Schindler's List is essential cinema...",
            "Schindler's List is monumental because it demands that we imagine the abominable, but it's great because of its creator's conviction that to ignore injustice is to sanction it.",

            "Schindler's List, with its grave documentary thoroughness and moral complexity, rewrites film history. It is one of the cinema's finest achievements.",
            "It was (and remains) irreducibly [Spielberg's] masterpiece.",
            "Spielberg understands that that tension is a problem not just of filming the subject, but of the subject itself: that the tale of any one individual has to struggle to avoid being swamped by the sheer scale of horror.",
            "It's an extraordinary work of vision and passion that raises even the gifted Spielberg to a new level of artistry. And like all great works, it elevates everyone who views it.",
            "Despite admirable intentions and the undeniable splendor of his craft, ultimately what Spielberg has told is the story of the list; he has not told the story of Schindler.",
            "Spielberg uses stark, brutal realism to put over his powerful points about racism and ethnic cleansing, and the use of stunning black-and-white photography and gritty hand-held camera footage give the film a potent documentary style."

            "Bassett ignites into a major star, a dazzling supernova, with her bravura acting and dancing as Tina Turner, a submissive wife who finally fights.",
            "Complete with the rock star wigs, superhero body and slightly timid but ever so deliberate snarl in her speech, Bassett embodied the icon during her slow and steady rise to fame, and her tumultuous marriage... ",
            "What`s Love Got to Do With It is sizzling film fare.",
            "[Fishburne's] performance is the one X factor in What's Love Got To Do With It, which in most respects is an entertaining if conventional pop star biography.",
            "Agreeably camped-up biopic, ringing with righteous sentimentality and brassy defiance, with a furiously good central performance from Bassett.",
            "Basset genuinely holds your sympathy as the little country girl Anna Mae Bullock, singing and suffering her way to superstardom and personal liberation, [and] Fishburne is sensational.",
            "Angela Bassett gives a superbly versatile performance as the heroine, and Laurence Fishburne's portrayal of Ike Turner consolidates his status as one of the most expressive and intelligent actors in movies today.",
            "A powerful, joyful, raw, energetically acted bio-pic detailing the joys and pain of the on- and offstage lives of blues rockers Ike and Tina Turner.",
            "As a powerhouse showcase for the acting talents of Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne and as a potent portrayal of wife beating and the emotions that surround it, it's quite a show.",
            "It's an astonishing movie, first because despite the pathology of the relationship, it's not only about victimization; it's a celebration of spirit, both religious and human, about a woman who finally found the guts (and the faith) to say \"No more.\"",
            " Fishburne and Bassett are both extraordinary, and though the story is inevitably slanted to Tina's perspective, Fishburne makes Ike a complex and compelling presence.",
            "A splashy, volatile, crowd- pleasing rock-star melodrama that makes up in sheer emotional wallop what it sometimes lacks in finesse.",
            "Powerful bio of Tina Turner with domestic violence, drugs.",
            "A passionate personal and professional drama that hits both the high and low notes of an extraordinary career.",
            "As Tina Turner, Angela Bassett gives a powerhouse well-deserved Oscar-nominated performance, but the biopic has more than its fair share of showbiz cliches.",
            "Angela Bassett shakes her tail feather with aplomb and pins down the singer's gestures with amazing precision. Top honours, however, belong to Fishburne's swaggering, savage portrayal of Ike.",
            "This biography of rock diva Tina Turner's turbulent life is filled with energetic musical numbers and emotionally charged moments, all anchored by two outstanding lead performances."

            "It's a bonafide masterpiece that warrants admiration, even two decades after its release.",
            "The Sandlot is just a fun, funny film that holds plenty of family appeal because it has a wholesome Norman Rockwell vibe and, as with any good sports film, you don't have to love the game to love the film.",

            "Any of Charles Schulz's baseball-oriented Peanuts strips contains more understanding of baseball and more insight into children, as well as more pointed fun.",
            "Several of the hard issues involving childhood -- getting accepted in a new neighborhood, getting accepted buy a new stepdad -- are handled with sensitivity.",
            "The Sandlot is a safe, wholesome, patriotic family picture about baseball, and if there is an original scene, it escaped my attention.",
            "In this well-crafted movie, a strong cohesive ensemble makes the team likable. Guiry as Scotty is especially good.",

            "Self-consciousness infects Nora Ephron's sweet but perilously thin love story, Sleepless in Seattle...such are the perils of these postmodernist times: even our love stories feed off borrowed emotion.",
            "A movie to which director and co-writer Nora Ephron brought her terrific flair, wit and nous, although she propagates the terrifying fallacy that a widower makes a wonderful romantic catch.",
            "Don't get me wrong: I have no objection to shamelessly corny love stories that make you well up with tearful joy. I just don't like it when the movie does the welling up for you. ",
            "Mostly, Sleepless in Seattle leaves you feeling restless in the audience.",
            "Despite a madcap, slapstick type of comic conclusion, with no real hope of marital longevity, the film is terribly romantic.",
            "Sleepless in Seattle finds a way to put a fresh seasoning on top of the genre.",
            "What are we teaching the other little sons of America, when they see so few movies as humane and woman-positive as Sleepless in Seattle, and so very many that portray women as evil incarnate?",
            "The emotional weight of the drama rests on Hanks, and you appreciate how skilfully Ephron structures the film so that the two principals are bound by song and sentiment rather than physical proximity.",
            "But the movie's problems go deeper-than the dialogue: its whole premise is flawed.",
            "The rest of this romantic comedy about the strange power that pulls a man and woman together... only reinforces the notion that Ephron is a filmmaker whose time has come at last, after years as a novelist, screenwriter and feminist wit.",
            "For nearly two hours, Ephron keeps her marvellous stars apart, a potentially dangerous tactic that works superbly.",
            "Substantially better, funnier, smarter, and more impeccably-controlled than almost everything that came in its wake.",
            "While I have returned to watch my favourite moments play out again and again, I am always rewarded by the subtlety and beauty in the scenes I don't remember.",
            "...a decent drama that never entirely lives up to its place as a classic romcom...",
            "A fairy tale that even teens can enjoy.",
            "A romantic treat.",
            "If one can ignore all the straining for lightness here, this is watchable enough, though hardly anything resembling a tearjerker.",
            "Ephron and fellow writers Jeff Arch and David S. Ward have conspired to make Sleepless in Seattle as purposefully schmaltzy as one can imagine, in a manner that's almost cynical.",
            "So overrated.",
            "Like most of Ephron's work, this one is shallow and contrived, but it stars two of America's most likable stars, Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks.",
            "It's easily the hippest, frankest and funniest date movie around.",
            "Sure it's contrived, but what a great romantic weeper."

            "The relationship between Travis and Myers is boring; too bad the whole film wasn't about the Scottish family. They deserve their own picture.",
            "A tres hip slice of life about the dilemma of marital commitment with just a pinch of Hitchcock providing the cutting edge.",
            "Myers pumps out a river of inventive shtick, but it doesn't cohere or connect; he seems less a character than a comedian doing couch time on a late-night talk show.",
            "Like an exploding haggis, funny but extremely messy.",
            "The look of So I Married an Axe Murderer is crisply professional, and John Graysmark's production design provides an element of visual surprise.",
            "Juggling mirth, romance and murder requires a deft touch -- think of Hitchcock's Trouble With Harry. Axe is a blunt instrument.",
            "Comedian Mike Myers is best handled in incredibly small doses.",
            "Fact is, So I Married An Axe Murderer fails on every level as a romantic comedy. It wants romance and a happy ending and a Woman-from-Hell.",
            "You may feel trapped in a Saturday Night Live skit part of the time; the silly plot doesn't hang together well, and too many bawdy jokes misfire. Nevertheless, a sweetness pervades the film, which provides a generous view of human nature.",
            "Best of all, are the characters who would be at home in one of Hitchcock's wackier outings: folks who are sympathetic or absurd, notorious or utterly psycho.",
            "Funny spoof on serial killers.",
            "Quirky '90s comedy with mock horror action, sexuality.",
            "Everyone quotes the Scottish-accented misanthropy. But at its heart, \"Axe\" is a sweet, funny romance between people trapped in patterns and freed by a positive paradigm shift. It's also the reason we never see Mike Myers' true face in films anymore.",
            "Although Myers is a brilliant comic, any potential he has as a romantic lead remains unfulfilled.",
            "Arkin and the late Hartman also provide memorable moments, while the film as a whole is good-natured enough to make up for its inconsistency.",
            "Not great, but is very watchable romance comedy.",
            "A disappointing film that never finds its right tone",
            "mike myers' only tolerable picture",
            "funny"
