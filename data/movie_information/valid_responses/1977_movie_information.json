            "Without the simple spiritual convictions of his predecessors, or the philosophical speculations of his contemporaries, Lucas has rather left his audience out in the cold.",
            "A boy's adventure yarn in the most traditional, unabashedly entertaining sense.",
            "Oh, the astronomical audiences; oh, the mundane story; oh, the over-cute little robots (one fat, one thin); oh, the vapid actors, the galactic shootouts; oh, the brilliant technology and oh, the boredom of it all.",
            "It's a \"fun movie\", as they say. Meaning that it doesn't mean anything, it's a superior, pop plaything to play with, to be innocently enjoyed and thrown away like a four-dollar comic book.",
            "I haven't had as much fun at a movie in years. With its technical wizardry, high-velocity storytelling and spirited good humor, Star Wars dazzles the child in us.",
            "Few films before or after it have managed to include such a celebrated, recognizable score - thanks to the masterful compositions by John Williams.",
            "Few films are ingrained in pop culture like Star Wars, partly because few films changed cinema like Star Wars.",
            "If you're out to see a movie with symbolism galore, stay away from Star Wars, but if a memory of that feeling you had at the Saturday matinee as a child is what you want, go stand in line.",
            "Star Wars is not just a movie to me. It's not just a movie to a lot of people. It's a part of who we are. It defines us. It's an important piece of our lives and it will live on in all of us forever. ",
            "Written and directed magnificently by George Lucas, the cast is excellent... but it is Chewbacca and the two robots who walk off with the acting honors. (Don't ask me what a Wookie is, go see the movie!)",
            "Star Wars began as a story that paid homage to what came before while forging its own path into the future. ",
            "It speaks to how timeless A New Hope has become that we take in so much of its art direction as it tends to whiz by so fast it requires multiple views to form an opinion of.",
            "Star Wars single-handedly changed the game for blockbuster movies and remains one of the greatest films of all time.",

            " It's so fun to watch, even now I'm in my 30s and I've seen it 100 times (not literally). The characters, setting, soundtrack and story are all top-rate. Watch it: now!",
            "With iconic characters and moments, A New Hope blazed a trail for cinema and helped by being a damn fine movie too.",
            "It is the cinematic magic and the sense of joyous fun that makes \"Star Wars\" a very special film. ",
            "Star Wars is, indeed, a movie that dares to be different, not only in setting, but in theme at a time when imagination has surrendered to realism in motion pictures. If you don't enjoy Star Wars, you are not as young at heart as you think you are.",
            "\"A New hope\" is very important on a historical level and in terms of technological innovation, but it is also a great adventure and fantasy story... [Full review in Spanish]"

            "Fresh, highly entertaining, and even a little bit challenging.",
            "A tired retread that a well-paid lead actor walks away from? Doesn't sound like screen magic in the making. But darned if Mr. Waters and his writers didn't pull it off. With a lot of help from a pinch-hitting Mom and a teenage Disney remake veteran.",
            "Curtis shows her comedic flare with gusto, perfectly capturing the mannerisms of a 15-year-old in her 44-year-old body. She is outstanding here.",

            "If you can sit through 30 interspersed minutes of trivialities, New York, New York emerges victoriously as the musical of the year, and reaffirms Liza Minelli's position as one of the top musical stars, as well as talented actress, on the screen.",
            "If lesser talents were involved, we might consider New York, New York quite passable entertainment, a pleasant collage of old musical movies. But with Scorsese, De Niro and Minnelli on the marquee, we expect more.",

            "Though affectionate and colorfully stylized, Scorsese's tribute to the darker classic Hollywood musicals is only partially successful...an interesting feature that ultimately fails as a period piece or dark musical.",

            "Embora interessante, a dire\u00e7\u00e3o de arte acaba se tornando uma distra\u00e7\u00e3o e os n\u00fameros musicais s\u00e3o, em sua maioria, frouxos. Por outro lado, De Niro e Minnelli criam personagens complexos que despertam a curiosidade do espectador. Um Scorsese menor.",

            "[Woody Allen] has miraculously made his most personal film his funniest.",
            "Annie Hall is as good as it is because its comedy is always on the brink of the minor tragedies of real life and love.",
            "Romantic, honest, and touching - all the kinds of things one wants from a smart rom-com that refuses to be guided by the genre's tropes.",
            "A soft, fuzzy, mildly diverting letdown.",
            "Woody Allen fans will buy it 100%. Never before has the diminutive comedian been so urbane, so open - so funny. And with lovely Diane Keaton as consort, it becomes well-nigh irresistible (especially if you find Keaton as well-nigh irresistible as I do).",
            "This is Woody Allen's signature film, arguably his best and certainly his most popular.",
            "Simple in story, complex in construction, and unquestionably innovative in style.",
            "[Woody Allen's] most recognizable film, the one that he is most associated with. ",
            "\"Annie Hall\" isn't a conventional rom-com but a very accurate and bittersweet depiction of the dynamics of relationships, tinged with Allen's melancholic personality, and made to go down easier than it normally would, due to his world-class humor.",
            "...a style that was at once realistic, deeply personal, and still full of energy and humor. ",
            "Keaton's own mannerisms-like her congenital inability to utter a complete sentence-can be irritating, she is able to provide a character of full dimensions, with a base of feeling and need that allows Annie Hall to be as moving as it is merry.",
            "The best film Woody Allen has ever made.",
            "Woody Allen has outdone himself. If Annie Hall is any indication, he has grown as a filmmaker; his latest movie displays far greater discipline and completeness than any past work.",
            "Clearly a deeply personal work for Allen, almost autobiographical in its evocation of his worldview. ",
            "Annie Hall may be 40 years old this year, but it still holds up as a great romantic comedy, that is simultaneously hilarious, sweet, and at times unexpectedly sad.",
            "Annie Hall is a great step forward in the already brilliant career of Woody Allen. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "Allen tosses out the usual romantic comedy conventions for his own brand of humor, but under the gags and self-effacing jokes is the portrait of two people who fall in love and then... fall out of love.",
            "Allen's imaginative, often avant-garde approach to the material goes a long way towards compensating for a decidedly uneven atmosphere...",
            "I think It's his best picture so far, and I hope that audiences will enjoy his drily aggressive, despairingly narcissistic humour as much as I did.",
            "Allen (as a result of his exposure to Bergman, perhaps) has greatly matured as a filmmaking talent. Annie Hall is, by far, his most sophisticated, most emotionally complex film.",
            "While its consonance comes largely from Gordon Willis's photography and Allen's spacious sense of New York, pathos comes at best from Keaton's evaporative performance and a slightly sentimental conception.",
            "Allen joins the Catskills tummler's anything-for-a-laugh antics with a Eurocentric art-house self-awareness and a psychoanalytic obsession in baring his sexual desires and frustrations, romantic disasters, and neurotic inhibitions.",
            "Although Woody Allen had still to acquire great technical strength as a film-maker, this was the movie where he found his own singular voice, a voice that echoes across events with a mixture of exuberance and introspection.",
            "It's a testament to the timelessness of Annie Hall that most of its references to pop culture or current events are unsuccessful in dating the film."
