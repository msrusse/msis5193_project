            "The Untouchables is a terrific movie, full of the same brand of fierce vitality that made the 1930s gangster films so compelling.",
            "While overtly melodramatic, The Untouchables is a perceptive and hard-driven actioner. It's an intriguing character confrontation, loaded with ironies, both personal and social.",
            "The Untouchables is two hours of fairly solid entertainment, an eventually uplifting parable about right beating might, cast in the form of a Warner Brothers social realist picture of the thirties.",
            "A deeply satisfying and entertaining Prohibition gang-buster directed with a Tommy gun's rat-tat-tat.",
            "The Untouchables could be the breakthrough movie for Kevin Costner, a folksy, Gary Cooperish actor who holds center stage as Eliot Ness.",
            "Where, under his stainless-steel incorruptibility, was Ness' gnawing flaw? To Mamet and De Palma, goodness and dullness seem inseparable.",
            "The script by David Mamet is serious, funny, dramatic, and action-packed at all the right times.",
            "It's a beautifully controlled film, as well as an intensely exciting and enjoyable one. Although De Niro and Connery easily walk away with the acting honors, the less flamboyant performance of Costner is perhaps the most admirable in the film.",
            "All of it sizzles with cigar smoke mixing with spent gunpowder and lament.",
            "Taut screenwriting (David Mamet) and a superb cast -- including a prize-winning performance by Sean Connery as the veteran Chicago cop -- help make 'The Untouchables' a classic.",
            "The best cop/mob movie remains decidedly untouchable.",
            "De Palma does superb job with the action sequences, which are choreographed, paced and acted out so well that they don't leave a palm dry in the house.",
            "Brian De Palma's version blends style, violence and a host of fine character portrayals into a rousing, point-blank period film.",
            "For many the main attraction of this modern classic is Sean Connery's Oscar-winning turn as the veteran Irish cop who shows Costner the ropes.",
            "De Palma's style rides substance out of town to leave a glorious compendium of genre cool, remixing the original '50s TV series just as Indiana Jones took a whip to '30s serial adventures.",
            "From a director of De Palma's resources -- both aesthetic and, these days, financial -- it's fair to expect something more than just not being bored.",
            "Unlike some past De Palma films, though, The Untouchables makes some of its strongest impressions in sequences that build suspense and characterization without readily resorting to mayhem.",
            "It's an action film without much personality or drive and without enough imaginative detail to make the action gripping or meaningful.",
            "It goes to that place that all films aspiring to greatness must attain: the country of myth, where all the figures must be larger and more vivid than life.",
            "...a consistently watchable yet sporadically captivating piece of work that is, unfortunately, starting to show its age...",
            "A perfectly adequate Hollywood movie, even classy and entertaining at times, but, despite De Palma's brilliant set piece which reworks the Odessa steps sequence from Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin, this is disappointing stuff.",
            "The results are watchable enough, with a particularly adept use of Sean Connery, Chicago locations, and period details.",
            "The film mostly revels in nostalgia and feels numb.",
            "De Palma's masterpiece is an exhilarating, moving and larger-than-life cops vs. crooks epic. Connery and De Niro steal the show in charismatic supporting turns. The best film of 1987."

            "Jane Craig is a feminist heroine in a way that few female romantic-comedy protagonists since have been, even the ones we consider strong and independent.",
            "James Brooks is too gifted a writer for that simple a story.",
            "All the performers are tops.",
            "Enormously entertaining.",
            "I struggle to think of a safer, more charming film.",
            "It achieves an unexpected flow in its development and an even more unexpected magic in certain moments. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Hunter shows us a woman who was never able to pretend she wasn't smarter than the guys, and gives a performance of such springy naturalness that it hardly seems like a performance at all.",
            "Broadcast News is a slick and well- scripted comedy, witty and well-paced; it makes no points that haven't been made before, but like its TV news team it makes them entertainingly.",
            "It's an intelligent, uproariously funny dissection of what really goes on in a TV newsroom, both on and off camera.",
            "The film has savvy and it has an edge, but there s not a trace of cruelty or cheap-shot, easy humor in it. Much of it, in fact, is startlingly warm and heartfelt. This is important; it's what makes this movie so easy to watch.",
            "This bittersweet love story is set against the world of network news and writer-producer-director James Brooks fills his satire with some lovable heros and villains -- and characters that don't quite fit into either category.",
            "(The) endlessly quotable writing... keeps the film fresh as Tom, Aaron and Jane carom off each other at ever-more oblique angles.",
            "The human element is just as prescient as it was then, while the characters' romantic/professional entanglements now have the added poignancy of the past tense.",
            "By looking at the small-screen picture...[Brooks] provocatively suggests that America's socio-political problems are pretty much the same as the personal problems of its citizens. [Blu-ray]",
            "People often behave foolishly in matters of love and just about everything else. That can lead to heartache and tragedy, but that same foolishness can also be very funny to watch, as it is here.",
            "The outstanding set pieces give the viewer an idea of the job pressures, its perks, pitfalls and how the news is in the long run compromised.",
            "In a film tracing the endless battles between style and substance, Brooks delivers both in abundance.",
            "Hunter and Brooks are hugely appealing as news professionals trying to stay afloat in the corporate cauldron.",
            "Worthy adult entertainment.",
            "One of the best entertainments of 1987.",
            "Though lacking visual style, this is a poignantly written film about the changing professional mores of TV news in the electronic age, well-acted by the three leads, Holly Hunter, William Hurt, and Albert Brooks."

            "That's really all the movie needs to work: a sublime villain, with tight, driven direction, perfectly sturdy, effective writing, and a heroine who we can believe in.",
            "The key to this movie is O'Quinn as the title character. He's a scary bastard, and as an actor he commits to the role.",
            "The Stepfather works for American Eagle Realty, and the company logo pegs him as both a patriot and a predator. 'It's like living with Ward Cleaver,' his stepdaughter complains, not knowing that the 'cleaver' reference could be another pun...",
            "...ultimately manages to overcome its almost aggressively uneven atmosphere to establish itself as a solid little '80s thriller.",

            "Just when it looked like slasher movies were wholly irredeemable, director Joseph Ruben came along to prove there is some intelligent life in this otherwise bereft subgenre.",
            " The Stepfather makes use of a classic fairy tale device--the false parent--but it turns out to have a powerful effect upon one's involvement with the characters.",
            "A high water mark of 1980s horror/suspense.",
            "Borrowing from Hitchcock (Shadow of a Doubt) and Kubrick (The Shining), Ruben's elegant, darkly humorous tale deconstructs patriarchy and can't be divorced from the Republican family values that dominated the 1980 with their 1950s retro feel.",
            "One of the classiest thrillers to never come out of Hollywood",
            "An inventive, overlooked, classic slasher film from the 80's.",

            "A triumph of the Merchant Ivory aesthetic. The cast are gorgeous. The passion is polite. The conclusion is a little surprising. Well worth reviving.",
            "This elegant, heart-rending romance is now ripe for the reclaiming as a gay landmark.",
            "Maurice is a candid, lucid, passionate film.",
            "A sumptuous film, whose beauty and importance has only increased with age. The very definition of a must-see.",
            "With compassion, humor and detachment, James Ivory's superb film of E.M. Forster's \"Maurice\" takes us into the complacent, fixed world of Britain's privileged classes in the years immediately before World War I.",
            "Wilby cracks the character's genteel surface, releasing bursts of fear, pride, and relief. His Maurice is neither martyr nor saint, radical only in his choice to pursue happiness.",
            "Arguably the most important, and certainly the most daring entry in the Merchant-Ivory canon, Maurice is a lush exploration of identity, passion, and being true to oneself.",
            "With a stellar cast and the beautiful cinematography, a benchmark of the Merchant Ivory productions, on full display, Maurice is well worth the watch.",
            "Maurice is a repetitive and slow film. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Maurice is certainly one of the best films in queer cinema.",
            "The most stunning example of such a persistently ambiguous vision, which is often about the inability to express or even know one's desire, is Maurice... If the film is slow and confusing, its confusion is inherent in attempts to represent gay sexuality.",
            "Certainly no more or less angst-ridden that other Forster adaptations of the time, Maurice is a worthy entry among the best Merchant-Ivory had to offer.",
            "It is difficult to sympathise with [Maurice], however dire his predicament.",
            "What's really revolutionary about this film is the way Ivory photographs male bodies in what were, by the standards of mainstream cinema at the time, quite explicit sex scenes. ",
            "It's as handsomely mounted as any of its more beloved brethren, especially in a shiny new 4k restoration, but it's no mystery why it was largely ignored back in the day.",
            "A beautifully photographed film with top-drawer performances from a fine cast.",
            "ultimately it keeps us engaged and reasonably entertained",
            "Maurice' paints a subtly scathing portrait of polite society, a portrait affording many opportunities for cameo acting triumphs. ",
            "Probably Merchant-Ivory's best film.",
            "Merchant and Ivory tell this story in a film so handsome to look at and so intelligently acted that it is worth seeing just to regard the production."

            "In its grave clarity, it's as pure and plaintive as a mountain ballad.",
            "Sayles must have meant his movie to stir and provoke, but the self-contained look of it yields something else -- a sense of quaintness, of harmless nostalgia.",
            "When this movie stumbles, it stumbles honestly and sympathetically, but, when it succeeds, it makes history sing.",
            "The movie works the way Westerns have always worked: In clear, simple terms and with straightforward dramatic devices.",
            "Continuing in his fabulous run in the '80s, Sayles was at the very top of his powers, shooting on location in West Virginia and populating his screen with a blend of gifted character actors.",
            "Matewan remains relevant as corporations and captains of industry continue to exploit workers and drum up fear about unions. ",
            "Matewan is a richly textured film, boosted by Haskell Wexler's Oscar-nominated cinematography and boasting a remarkable cast of established stars, promising newcomers, and Sayles regulars.",
            "Matewan is an earnest and sympathetic look at both the universal tragedy of the exploitation of workers and the specific tragedy of the struggle of the Matewan townspeople to find some dignity in a harsh existence. ",
            "The film is beautifully shot (by veteran cinematographer Haskell Wexler) and works not just as a tense drama, but also as a fascinating recreation of the shifting politics of the the 1920s, where workers' rights blurred with socialism.",
            "This thoughtful film is real in every respect, right down to the plaintive sound of a country woman`s ballad.",
            "John Sayles' period piece is an ambitious drama of union making and union breaking in the 1920a",
            "Cinematographer Haskel Wexler contributes greatly to the look and feel of a truly special cinematic achievement.",
            "Matewan is a heartfelt, straight-ahead tale of labor organizing in the coal mines of West Virginia in 1920 that runs its course like a train coming down the track.",
            "The result is witty, astute, and finally very moving.",
            "For all of the binary simplicity of the film's moral structure, the question of violence, its utility or even necessity, is the great ambiguity at the film's center.",
            "An old-fashioned movie that will make the hearts of all idealists truly sing.",
            "Superb drama by John Sayles; Chris Cooper is brilliant.",
            "With Oscar winner Haskell Wexler acting as cinematographer, Matewan is beautifully shot, and there is not a weak performance in the film."

            "As Valens, Lou Diamond Phillips has a sweetness and sincerity that in no way diminish the toughness of his onstage persona. The role is blandly written, but Mr. Phillips gives Valens backbone.",
            "The movie works surprisingly for reasons that have nothing to do with Valens` small list of hits. La Bamba is really just a very good family story about a pushy mother proud of one son, derisive of another.",
            "How many films can be squeezed out of this formula?",
            "Melodrama is inherently a broad genre -- one that projects inner psychological conflicts onto towering outside forces -- and in the overall thrust of his film, Valdez excels in conveying a world dominated by a gigantic, impersonal power.",
            "La Bamba has a lot going for it besides its compelling teen myth. As might have been predicted, the music is terrific.",
            "An energetic picture filled with light and music, and Lou Diamond Phillips is an easygoing charismatic presence as Ritchie Valens, so sweet-hearted he's almost angelic. ",
            "Valdez's simple-yet-elegant visual style is on target and his script uses the elements of Valens' life to the fullest, almost creating an underlying poetic rhythm to the film.",
            "It's easy to forgive the thudding omens and ironies, since they appear in such a life-affirming context. The purpose of La Bamba is not to mourn Valens's death but to celebrate his life, with special attention to the great joy he found in music.",
            "With a convincing performance by newcomer Phillips -- and the exhilarating Latin rockers Los Lobos, who bring Valens's sound back to life -- La Bamba is a refreshing blast from the past.",
            "Valens, meanwhile, is played with likeable charm and refreshing innocence by relative newcomer Lou Diamond Phillips. Among the large supporting cast, Rosana De Soto stands out as Ritchie's proud and loving mother.",
            "Most pop biopics are tepid affairs, but the same cannot be said for director Luis Valdez's engrossing re-creation of Ritchie Valens's short life.",
            "The actors are mostly appealing and Valens's 50s hits (dubbed in by Los Lobos) are given their energetic due.",
            "A perfectly respectable biopic.",
            "La Bamba is a well-versed depiction of Ritchie Valens' life, and it is evident a tremendous amount of care was put into the production of this film.",
            "A strong statement about the fleeting, fragility of life, and the bond between brothers.",
            "This is a movie about music and it is the Valens sound, a unique blending of Latin rhythm and rock beat, that prevents La Bamba from being just another example of Hollywood hero worship.",
            "Sweet, sad rock-idol story for mature teens.",
            "An enjoyable if slightly innocuous biopic based on the brief life and short-lived fame of teen rock'n'roll idol Richie Valens.",

            "[A]fter an opening sequence as promising as the one here, it needs at least an attempted follow-through, not the jumble of confused ideas and time-wasting effects that take up the bulk of the film. ",
            "Surveying the peculiar array of 1980s retreads clustered into release this week, I'm reminded of Marty McFly in Back to the Future Part II, traveling forward in time 30 years to discover that everything is still the same, only worse.",
            "The Brazilian director Jos\u00e9 Padilha may be working for a Hollywood studio but he doesn't temper his critique of American imperialism, big business and political corruption.",
            "Padilha is Brazilian, and it's interesting that both RoboCops have been made by men whose non-Hollywood work focused on their respective countries' curdled politics.",
            "This Robo-reboot tries fiercely to update the satirical punch and stylistic perversity Paul Verhoeven's 1987 original. It's a futile gesture.",
            "Cynical, boring, PG-13 retread.",
            "Ends up being a far too timid remake.",
            "The comparisons are inevitable but the remake is no masterpiece.",
            "This new version of RoboCop is an entirely different animal, and that's just fine. Gone is the biting social satire...The social conscience is still there, but it's more subtle and more along the lines of commentary than all out satire.",
            "RoboCop wants to be about big ideas like identity, the nature of self, man vss technology, security versus freedom, corporate greed that puts profits over people, and all manner of lofty themes. Only the film never actually explores any of them.",
            "Unfortunately, like a lot of the ideas, they never really capitalized on it and the idea was ultimately just forced into a simple plot device to move things along.",
            "Maybe every generation gets the RoboCop it deserves. I'm just not sure what we did to deserve this one.",
            "A sleek, mechanical film missing the brain, the heart and, most of all, the balls that powered the first one.",
            "Well-paced, cleverly drawn out though lacking in places, RoboCop will please those who aren't into the heavy stuff. ",
            "Aside from the decision to relegate the insightful and challenging drone content to Jackson's sporadic monologues, the worst decision was to ixnay the satirical comedy of the original film.",
            "A reboot with a real kick.",
            "RoboCop is a respectful remake. Nevertheless, it fails to captivate the violence and social satyre of Paul Verhoeven's cult classic. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "The problem is the film never seems like it has a point or purpose... Kinnaman doesn't help either. He's a rather bland lead whose performance is robotic even before he dons the armored suit. ",
            "RoboCop is a decent action science-fiction film that does make us think and feel, but not as much as it could have given its parameters and heritage. ",
            "I can't really figure it out. From what I saw on the screen, nobody else could either.",
            "For Padilha's run-of-the-mill RoboCop, the metal-head crime-stopper is barely worth his arresting appeal.",
            "RoboCop's beating heart has been subsumed by the single-minded programming of MGM's franchise-building machinery. ",
            "Is this new RoboCop trying to be the original? No, it's not. It takes the core concept of the original and does its own thing with it.",
            "RoboCop is both inventive and original enough to stand on its own animatronic feet, and I was in shock how much I enjoyed this reinvention."

            "Beyond the ridiculous premise, there's nowhere for this story to go, and we don't get enough shark action to make up for it.",
            "Savagely dull, though at least it is tremendously incompetent as well, and thus marginally amusing, especially when the shark is actually onscreen.",
            "Makes Jaws: 3-D look like a bloody masterpiece.",
            "Pacing leaves a lot to be desired and the moment-of-attack sequences, full of jagged cuts and a great deal of noise, more closely resemble the view from inside a washing machine.",

            "In The Living Daylights, Dalton establishes his claim to the role; in the films that will follow, he'll have the chance to dig deeper.",
            "Dalton shows a serious side that's been missing from the role since Sean Connery's earliest 007 days. And as a whole, the new picture is less of a special-effects affair than most of Roger Moore's Bond films.",
            "As with other Bond movies, the locations in The Living Daylights are more remarkable than its plot.",
            "The result is a film that is not so much bad as mechanical and uptight.",
            "After the fizzle of the later Roger Moore Bonds, The Living Daylights brings in a new 007 in Timothy Dalton, who manages the Connery trick of seeming suave and tough at the same time.",
            "Smartly, it kickstarts a grander daredevilry in Bond films - and a greater realism in the violence - that is entirely welcome.",
            "The Living Daylights breathes new life into the series and we needed that.",
            "If you're looking for a bit for fun in your Bond film, this would be one to skip, otherwise it's a really good action film with some top class set pieces.",
            "While the film seemed relatively modern well into the '90s, now it is a bygone era for which I'm nostalgic.",
            "Dalton's Bond brings the British spy much closer to the head and heart of a real character.",
            "Just what the franchise needed to become more culturally relevant as the 1990s approached. ",
            "The relative clarity of the story allows director John Glen and screenwriters Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson to inject moments of subtlety and human interest -- commodities that in recent Bonds have been in even shorter supply than sense.",
            "Why not send James off to well-earned retirement with a gold-plated martini shaker and the thanks of a grateful moviegoing public?",
            "Despite being hampered by an overly convoluted plot and two of the feeblest Bond villains ever (greedy buffoons Koskov and Whitaker don't have a quantum of menace between them), Dalton brings much-needed grit to the role. ",
            "This was Timothy Dalton's debut as 007 and it was already pretty clear that he lacked the necessary ironic touch that made the credibility-straining action seem fun rather than ridiculous.",
            "Bond is impersonated by 007 newcomer Timothy Dalton, who does little that's identifiable as acting, although he looks the part.",
            "Colorful, vibrant, exotic, The Living Daylights more than delivers an eyeful of entertainment. At a running length just over two hours, the most thrill- seeking Bond fans will get their money`s worth.",
            "More serious, tougher version of Bond has plenty of violence.",
            "\"Finally, a James Bond movie that Ian Fleming can be proud of. Dalton is a lean, mean and bold Bond. Full of great action and featuring a romantic sub-plot that elevates this above most other 007 adventures.\"",
            "Dalton is a dapper, dashing and dangerous Bond. And although \"Casino Royale's\" sophisticated blend of thrills and personal turmoil slightly eludes \"Daylights,\" it's a sign that the producers then had the right instincts if not the full initiative.",
            "Dalton gets a chance to demonstrate a fascinating, if slightly too actorly take on [James Bond].",
            "It was somehow more entertaining than how it sounds.",
            "...ultimately comes off as one of the most ineffective and flat-out dull entries within the ongoing series."

            "If his considerable achievement in this long- awaited film falls short of his Olympian standards, there is a reason that ought to give Kubrick some satisfaction. The world has caught up with Kubrick and what he has to say.",
            "It may seem too spare, too clinical, its moments of war even too familiar for some. But, aiming for minds as well as hearts, Kubrick hits his target squarely.",
            "What gives this story its power is not really its originality, but the relentlessness of Kubrick's black-comic vision and the tightness of his focus.",
            "There is a real fear at the heart of this monstrously armored, desperately defensive film.",
            "A hard-hitting movie laced with moments of dark humour and brimming with social commentary, Full Metal Jacket is viewed as one of the all-time great war movie.",
            " Kubrick had a way of making the audience become invested in the characters of his films and created some truly memorable ones.",
            "It was a gross injustice that Ermey was not nominated for his tremendous performance. ",
            "A nicely contrasting soundtrack, intense action sequences, mesmerizing sets, excellent photography, and believable characters contribute to this poignant thriller.",
            "Full Metal Jacket is a master study in indoctrination and fundamental identity shifts. Every moment of the film builds and builds on Kubrick's ideas...",
            "We look to the director for some judgment, or even an indication of his opinion, as to whether his carnage artists are born or made; but we don't get it.",
            "An electrifying opening segment that could stand alone as one of Kubrick's great films, except it's only about 45 minutes long.",
            "Full Metal Jacket, produced, directed and co-written by Stanley Kubrick, is not an easy film to watch, but from the first frame to the last, it is a riveting one.",
            "One of the classics of war cinema, it's not nearly as good as its legend suggests. But it's pretty good.",
            "...a justifiably iconic war film. ",
            "One of Kubrick's foremost triumphs, a genuinely challenging and uncomfortable war film",
            "No amount of stylistic analysis, however, is likely to explain why a man would devote more than three years of his life to making a war movie in which violent death isn't meant to move us. Does Kubrick really think we're not callous enough about war?",
            "While its message is simple -- innocent young Americans are taught to be machine-like killers -- its technique is extraordinary.",
            "If a film doesn't give us people, it has to offer a substitute -- an idea, a style, a vision. Full Metal Jacket comes up blank.",
            "Relentlessly harsh in its images and language, Full Metal Jacket is nonetheless the most artful film yet made about the Vietnam War.",
            "Full Metal Jacket is a great motion picture. Be warned, however, that it is harsh and explicit.",
            "It's a great piece of filmmaking, diminished only by a second act that fails to live up to the first act of the Marines in training.",
            "It still qualifies as one of Kubrick's most underrated pictures, and it's second only to Apocalypse Now as the best Vietnam War movie ever made."

            "Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor is like a lavishly prepared six-course meal during which the host keeps telling us we would all be happier and healthier with a place of cold porridge.",
            "Not for the first time in Bertolucci's work, the parts do not quite build into a whole, even when that whole is built on shifting perspectives. But they are magnificent.",
            "The most startling achievement of The Last Emperor is that it accomplishes what seems to have eluded Bertolucci for some time. He has found the small in the large and, in many ways, he has created what many thought impossible -- an intimate epic.",
            "As pure spectacle, \"The Last Emperor\" is a spellbinding peek behind the gate of a lost world.",
            "It is a hesitant, conservative approach that yields great elegance and a rhythm that carries the viewer along. Yet the film is haunted by a sense of opportunities not taken, of an artist deliberately reining in his artistry.",
            "If there is such a thing as voluptuous detachment, Bertolucci and John Lone have found it. Lone's achievement in his absorbing account of Pu Yi is to place him at a distance and yet make his plight totally involving.",
            "As with many epics that span nearly three hours, this one contains a number of pacing issues.",
            "Brilliant and intimate. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Set against the richly textured fabric of China, The Last Emperor is both a compelling human drama and a superb history lesson.",
            "As a resplendently gorgeous historical pageant of China in the 20th century, The Last Emperor is, visually at least, the most beautiful movie in years. But as an involving human drama about Pu Yi... it doggedly refuses to come to much dramatic life.",
            "A modern filmmaker could have all the good qualities of this film but make it in Mandarin with a better, more compelling script and it could be an amazing film.",
            "Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor is a stunning achievement, a rare film of great beauty and power It lifts viewers, as only the best films do, to unique and all-encompassing experiences in a land and time unfamiliar to many of us",
            "The visual magnificence of Bertolucci's film is so great that he has removed the project almost beyond criticism.",
            "The Last Emperor is a spectacular film photographed in brilliant color. It is also a moral drama with controversial political overtones of great ambiguity.",
            "It is the grandeur of the boy king and his unreal opulent world that is best remembered, splendid and isolated, and at last, because of its loneliness, sad.",
            "One of the most provocative and stunningly beautiful films of the past 20 years.",
            "One of the most visually arresting pictures of recent years.",
            "The story is colorful and sometimes unpredictable, so it's rarely boring. But it's rarely much deeper than the emperor's favorite rice bowl.",
            "Even though its ambitions sometimes get the better of it, the film succeeds often enough to make us grateful that, even in our MTV age, a director like Bertolucci is still willing to get on the mat and grapple with Personality and History.",
            "At last a real, thought-provoking, eyeball-popping movie epic.",
            "The man, who only has been superficially shown, gets lost for a while in the sweep of events. Yet in spite of these reservations, this lush film merits attention.",
            "There's probably a truly great movie in the story of Pu Yi, but The Last Emperor is not that movie. Still, what director Bernardo Bertolucci (Last Tango in Paris) has accomplished here is both ambitious and impressive.",
            " Bernardo Bertolucci takes this outline of Pu Yi's tumultuous life and transforms it into an absurdist journey in The Last Emperor, a masterpiece about the loneliness and hubris of believing that we can control our own destiny.",
            "[A] massive, magnificent historical biopic."

            "The sensibility of this movie is so adolescent that it's hard to take it as seriously as the filmmakers intend us to.",

            "Douglas steals the show as the rich guy viewers love to hate.",

            "Michael Douglas has a splendid part here, and tackles it with relish.",
            "The conflict may be familiar, but Stone brings the mystery of Wall Street's heros and villains, its big-stakes players and two-bit salesmen into sharp focus. It's a look that is both exhilarating and astounding.",
            "...an eye-opening behind-the-scenes glimpse at an almost alien landscape.",
            "For a motion picture that, at the time of shooting, was intended to be relatively hip and cutting-edge, it is now so laughably outdated it almost feels like science-fiction.",
            "Like the rest of Stone's oeuvre, it's about as subtle as a sledgehammer. But his filmmaking style is like heavy metal: When he hits the right chords, nobody plays with as much power or brash energy.",
            "Some of the 1980s-era details may seem a bit dated, and the movie's attitude toward women is slightly despicable, but the overall story arc, echoing the \"Faust\" tale, is timeless.",

            "What seems an enjoyable piece of fluff about a summer camp romance is, in its own quiet way, a powerful morality tale.",

            "If the ending of Eleanor Bergstein's script is too neat and inspirational, the rough energy of the film's song and dance does carry one along, past the whispered doubts of better judgment.",
            "Although the plot is sometimes implausible, the movie's music, dancing and romantic spirit carry a lot of it. In addition, Dirty Dancing has the virtues of a female main character (a bit unusual in a coming-of-age movie) and an interesting setting.",
            "The film exists in the main for a handful of seductively lit and framed dance sequences that aestheticise Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze's bodies and physical chemistry. ",

            "Dirty Dancing is dull and charmless. The initial curiosity turns into disappointment and the only memorable aspect is the effort of the protagonist Jennifer Grey. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Dirty Dancing, directed by Emile Ardolino, is a conventional film in its Borscht Belt setting, ethnic satire, and feel-good ending, but with a deliciously subversive core.",
            "There was no chemistry, the story was \"blah.\"",
            "I'm just glad it was an hour-and-a-half. I can see why it was a hit, but this is just all kinds of boring.",
            "Between the great soundtrack, the physical appeal of the very approachable Grey and smoking hot Swayze, the undeniable chemistry between the leads and the toe-tapping dance numbers, Dirty Dancing is inherently watchable.",
            "I like it much better than any of the Molly Ringwald coming of age comedies from the 80s.",
            "Dirty Dancing may just be one of the most seminal garbage movies ever. But, garbage it is.",
            "Packs in drama, comedy, and an iconic finale that's still quite riveting.",
            "It's a sweet, lyrical movie with plenty of musical nostalgia. But more importantly, Dirty Dancing has an uplifting message of hope that can be found only in the dreams of the young.",
            "These are not characters, but objects of choreography used to push a thoughtless agenda of sound and movement.",
            "While it's easy to be cynical about the whole affair, the film's sheer audacity is admirable, and Dirty Dancing knows what it aspires to.",
            "There is some freshness in the film, much of it supplied by Jennifer Grey, who's appealing, thoughtful and just right as Baby. There's also some eloquence, although most of it is supplied by the wonderful vintage pop songs.",
            "Smart and funny, touching and unabashedly sensual.",
            "You are likely to leave Dirty Dancing feeling good about what happens to the characters and longing to dance as they do.",

            "Light and likable, with hearts unabashedly all over its sleeves, Roxanne is a winning romantic comedy whose appeal should cross age barriers and backgrounds -- giving it an across-the-board promise.",

            "In the end it's hopelessly sappy stuff.",
            "Far and away [Martin's] richest film to date, lyrical, sweet-natured, touching, and very, very funny.",
            "The nose itself is a perfect prop for a man who began his career with a fake arrow through his head, a man who has since evolved from a coolly absurdist stand-up comic to a fully formed, amazingly nimble comic actor.",
            "Martin claims to have written 25 script drafts for this film, which indicates the uphill trudge he faced...what he has produced is Steve Martin playing a nice 'n' wacky guy in a sappy story.",
            "Sadly, most of the humor falls completely flat.",
            "It manages to entertain. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Martin is very funny in the role, and most ingenious about finding modern equivalents for the various bits of business in the original play. Yet the nagging question remains: Why?",
            "Witty, sweet, utterly delightful.",
            "Roxanne has a way of making you feel good even though you know it may be the corniest movie you've seen. Filled with romance, from its plot to the scenery, Roxanne makes no apologies for its sweet fervor.",
            "Charming '80s romantic comedy has innuendo, swearing.",
            "...an entertaining yet undeniably forgettable romcom that benefits substantially from the stars' charismatic work.",
            "for all the things this movie is, it's probably Martin's fault.",
            "It's difficult to call a movie this light and insubstantial a classic, but it's as likeable as ever more than two decades after its initial release.",
            "another in a long line of Cyrano De Bergerac adaptations but easily one of the very best",
            "I'd call it reasonably successful, but I can't get excited about it.",
            "In an era when romance seems to have taken second place to sex, it's heartwarming to see a film like Roxanne bring back the loveliness of love.",
            "The film's success rests firmly with Martin. He wrote the warm-hearted script and delivers a sparkling performance of physical and verbal gymnastics that he hasn't been able to match since.",
            "Very good adaptation of Cyrano with Steve Martin in one his best roles."

            "The cartoon vision of southwestern tackiness doesn't cut very deep, but the mise-en-scene is packed with clever clutter.",
            "While film is filled with many splendid touches and plenty of yocks, it often doesn't hold together as a coherent story.",
            "Starting from a point of delirious excess, the film leaps into dark and virtually uncharted territory to soar like a comet.",
            "Like Blood Simple, it's full of technical expertise but has no life of its own.",
            "A delightfully singular, strikingly bizarre, and unquestionably hysterical cult comedy.",
            "...the movie's tremendously affable atmosphere is heightened by the efforts of a perfectly-cast roster of performers...",
            "As well-made as any other indie film of the late '80s, and frequently hilarious on top of it.",
            "Yes, the Coens are techno-brat showoffs, but when the show is this good, who cares?",
            "In their first masterpiece, the Coens first delight with sheer kinetics, then dazzle with colorful colloquialisms & verbal voodoo, and eventually disarm you with the grace and guile through which they examine modern foibles, failures and forgiveness.",
            "A non-stop chase movie filled with so much good humor it's like an all-expense paid trip to another planet.",
            "The immense joy of this is in the realization that, for all their precision, Joel and Ethan Coen are essentially comic barnstormers rather than frigid ironists",

            "An entertaining, energetic, and stylish comedy about a simple but loving couple who long to be parents.",
            "In a shrewdly calculated move to show their versatility, the Coens made this madcap comedy right after Blood Simple. If their debut was slow and spare, this one has breathneck pacing and hopping banter by terrific Holly Hunter and Nicolas Cage.",
            "This is one of the funniest things I've ever seen!",
            "Raising Arizona... is an explosively clever and riotously funny exploration of fertility, homemaking, and the working class in the prisons and trailer parks of the desert southwest."

            "Empire of the Sun is a breathtaking movie in its scope and energy. It's just that, true to its childlike quality, this film is just a little too over-anxious to get its point across.",

            "Spielberg...displays a progressive and sophisticated awareness of issues of class and race that may be viewed as an apology for the casual imperialist and racist assumptions of his Indiana Jones series.",
            "Christian Bale, then 13, is a revelation as Jim, an obnoxious British colonial child being brought up in luxury in China.",
            "No special use is made of the talents of Miranda Richardson, Nigel Havers, Joe Pantoliano and the others, so it is up to young English thesp Bale to engage the viewer's interest, which he does superbly.",
            "One of Spielberg's best films, yet seldom shown."

            "After watching this sizzling crime thriller, you will be at a loss to explain why director Jim McBride failed to go on and take Hollywood by storm. At least the careers of Dennis Quaid and Ellen Barkin were boosted.",

            "There's plenty of southern comfort in this entertaining thriller. Terrific performances from Quaid and Barkin make this into an overlooked gem of 1980s Hollywood.",
            "Much better than the average cop movie: the script bristles with wittily tough talk, while fast-pattering Quaid works up a nice double act romance-feud with Barkin (his cheeky grin is well-matched with her lopsided smile).",

            "The film fails at every level.",
            "It is a smart, generous, genuinely funny affair. Sometimes, like the camel who almost ambles away with the picture, it's longish in the tooth, but it is based on an extremely astute vision of life.",
            "Reasonably genial and diverting.",
            "Ishtar is a good movie, but you can't help but wonder if, lurking somewhere in those cans of outtakes, there isn't a great movie, too. ",
            "This Elaine May comedy was the most underappreciated commercial movie of 1987. It isn't quite as good as May's previous features, but it's still a very funny work by one of this country's greatest comic talents. ",
            "Though far from a masterpiece, the movie is often hilarious in a sly, seemingly improvisational way.",
            "It seems too many people participated to save the unsalvageable. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "There are three or four memorable sequences in Ishtar -- the purchase of the blind camel, the use of fake Arabic in an auction scene, and the first horrendous singing performance of stupid songs. But the film lacks pace and consistent tone.",
            "Ishtar is cute, reasonably pleasant entertainment, but no motion picture oasis for Hoffman, Beatty or their fans.",
            "Beatty goes along with the casting joke of playing the nerd sidekick to Hoffman's slick loverboy. But zany antics aren't his forte. Hoffman's impishness serves the film better until the sheer weight of the production grinds him down",
            "One of the grossest miscalculations of the blockbuster era.",
            "An incredible box office loser and, to be frank, far from great, Ishtar is still not nearly as awful as many would have it.",
            "So is the film merely a misunderstood messenger from God, or is it really just a barren desert of blind camel jokes? ",
            "It's a film that resists categorization, staking a claim on a weird, absurdist territory of its own. For that, in the maddeningly generic landscape of '80s multiplexes, it was crucified. Now it's celebrated. And rightfully so.",
            "This big, overblown comedy starring Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty is thoroughly likable despite all the hype.",
            "..an undeniably messy movie that you nonetheless want to treasure just for its oddball existence.",
            "Maybe [it's] actually okay; maybe parts of it [are] even great.",
            "The performances are endearing enough, the pacing is actually quite crisp and there is no shortage of zany silliness in the story. It just never gels.",
            "The 1980s saw the release of so many truly atrocious films (Xanadu, Stroker Ace, Bolero, Shanghai Surprise, etc.) that it's absurd \"Ishtar\" became shorthand for the worst of the worst and continues to be blasted by folks who haven't even seen it.",
            "Besides droll supporting work from an excellent Charles Grodin, Ishtar also gets a lot of mileage out of its terrible and terribly funny songs.",
            "If Ishtar has a personal stamp, it's not in what it has to say about Reagan-era militarism, but in what it has to say about collaboration, and how well-meaning people can goose each other to greatness-and folly.",
            "Ishtar is a failure on practically every level from its misguided narrative to its lack of humor to the absence of anything remotely entertaining.",
            "A victim of its own hyped publicity and too harsh criticism, Ishtar is not the worst movie ever made or even a bomb, just a dim-witted silly comedy-thriller (with some good jokes) based on the casting against type of Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman.",
            "Desert sequences provide some of the film's high points as Beatty and Hoffman finally develop some genuine rapport under adverse conditions."

            "At times funny and clever, Moonstruck asks the questions: what does it mean to be in love? and is it ever okay to settle?",
            "This is a movie that makes you want to sing \"Boheme\" and walk in the moonlight and move to Brooklyn.",
            "You will not easily forget this incredibly robust family.",
            "An American movie with foreign-film sensibilities, Moonstruck's depths come from their perfect balance of writing and direction.",
            "While it leans a bit too heavily on the whimsy, Moonstruck is nevertheless a winning romantic comedy.",
            "With a sharply-written, Oscar-winning screenplay populated with compelling characters and an outstanding ensemble, Moonstruck goes beyond the typical rom-com trappings to deliver something a little more substantial than your standard entries in the genre.",
            "Moonstruck is regarded as one of the great romantic comedies of all time, but mio dio, it's truly the antidote to bad vibes.",
            "This uproarious exercise in accidental relationships, unveiled adultery, and coincidental prosperity is a grand romantic comedy that shouldn't be missed.",
            "The movie is pleasant, full of charm, entertaining, subtle, at times complicated, but always easy to follow. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Hinging on the lead performance of Cher - who won one of the three Oscars awarded to the film - it benefits from its very specific New York setting, its consistent sense of humor and its deep sense of romantic realism.",
            "Moonstruck is one of those movies you watch and say, \"they don't make them like that anymore.\" However, it's more than just a few laughs and iconic line readings. Its tight story structure and Cher's magnetic performance is hard to not get swept up in.",
            "I love Cher in this and her chemistry with Nicholas Cage is off the charts.",
            "Best performance ever by a musician transitioning from recording studio to silver screen? The incomparable Cher would have to go close here.",
            "Jewison's point seems to be that love may not be perfect, but it can be sweet fun.",
            "Cher is simply wonderful, and the teaming with Cage an inspiration. The rest of the cast couldn't be better.",
            "It isn't great art -- it`s too closely concentrated on immediate emotional effect for that -- but it is highly sophisticated craftsmanship.",
            "No resistance could overcome the overfamiliarity of the situations in Moonstruck, the corniness of its dramaturgy or the banality of its message.",
            "There's an old-fashioned romanticism about the picture, a sweet, gentle approach to love and family life. But this is kept from seeming sappy by the picture's tough-minded, almost abrasive sense of humor.",
            "Cher and Nicolas Cage have a ball in this ethnic comedy of manners, and there are moments of pure magic when moonlight does its romantic work.",
            "This charming comedy show [Cher] at her warm and supple best.",

            "This tedious sequel casts the producer's uncharismatic son (Bateman) as Fox's similarly afflicted cousin Todd, but offers only a faint echo of its predecessor.",
            "Mr. Bateman can be an exceptionally engaging actor. Last season he ran away with Valerie Harper's television series, now called ''Valerie's Family.'' He deserves much better than this sloppy sequel.",
            "Bateman is bland and inoffensive in this dopey role, half of which is performed in a cheap hair suit that makes him look like an escapee from a polyester petting zoo.",
            "Dreadful, unfunny sequel lacks charm of the original.",
            "An anaemic rip-off interesting only as a minor 1980s artefact.",
            "Despite the presence of comic veterans such as John Astin, juvenile slapstick is the order of the day and Bateman shows little early sign of his now-proven comic timing.",
            "It's hard to imagine a more calculated sequel than Teen Wolf Too.",
            "Fun, silly werewolf teen comedy featuring Jason Bateman. This is the sequel to Teen Wolf, in case you couldn't tell.",
            "Why? Oh, god, Whyyyyyy?",
            "The sequel the world was crying for.",
            "Dismal. The first one wasn't great either."

            "Despite its nearly two-and-a-half-hour running time, its superstar cast and its $23 million budget, Mr. Babenco's ''Ironweed'' is skeletal, a mere outline of Mr. Kennedy's far more resonant book.",
            "Misery is made into an esthetic. [Full Review in Spanish]",
