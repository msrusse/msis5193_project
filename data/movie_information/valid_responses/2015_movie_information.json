            "It's both nostalgic and fresh, a tender homage to, especially, the initial Star Wars (\"Episode IV: A New Hope\"), as well as a bridge to help those of us stuck in the splendor of Hoth edge into the future.",
            "Star Wars: The Force Awakens gives new life to a franchise of hope, resilience, courage and family that's been missing from theatres for far too long.",
            "Star Wars: The Force Awakens honors the series and takes it in exciting new directions. Both The Millennium Falcon and millennials, it would seem, are in good hands.",
            "'The Force Awakens' does what the original films did well - and is also its own, thrilling thing.",
            "Despite the copious servings of tragic threats and good feelings, the production sinks under the weight of its emotional calculation.",
            "It all comes together nicely as the actors breathe vulnerability, fallibility and personality into their roles, with Daisy Ridley being quite the commanding presence. My favourite, hands down, is the cute and rotund droid BB-8.",
            "We waited 30 years for the same basic story? Hmpf. At least it looked good and had the original cast. Without that, we'd all be crying ripoff.",
            "It's an entertaining and spirited film that proves, once again, that the force is still with J.J. Abrams.",
            "The mediocrity of The Force Awakens is not the fault of the audience, but people need to demand more. This is simply not serious or challenging filmmaking, even in the action genre.",
            "Star Wars: The Force Awakens is the perfect homage to the original trilogy.",
            "It's an entertaining rollercoaster that does a lot of good things ... I just wish the production took more of a chance to create its own identity, the reward would've been worth the risk.",
            "The Force Awakens lives up to the promise and expectation created by the trailers.",
            "It's a one of those sequels that makes you buy the ticket to see it again. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "I wouldn't go so far as to call it one of the best films of the year, but it's rock-solid entertainment, and it's restored my faith in a galaxy far, far away.",
            "It was clever. It was funny. It was hokey and nostalgic. ",
            "It's a wonderfully rollicking adventure populated with beloved, familiar characters and intriguing new ones, all with earnest performances and striking chemistry. ",
            "The kids will respond -- strongly -- to the swashbuckling and derring do, and the vibrant new stars in the making. For older fans like myself, there is a poignance in seeing how things turned out for our old heroes.",
            "It's enough to make a grown fan cry.",
            "It doesn't really do anything wrong, but that is not the same as doing everything right.",
            "The Force Awakens is a brilliant return to Star Wars that evokes extreme nostalgia and led to a spark that led onto one of the best entries in the Skywalker saga.",
            "Yes, The Force Awakens cribs from previous incarnations of the franchise, but the true power lies in the heart of the characters. Both Ridley and Boyega pop off the screen. ",
            "Star Wars: The Force Awakens more than makes up for the sour taste of the prequel trilogy.",
            "The Force Awakens checks all the correct boxes, sets the stage for a new series of films.",
            "The Force is strong with this one. Star Wars: The Force Awakens kicks into hyper-drive and never stops."

            "It's a premise that seems ridiculous until you start to realize it might actually be brilliant, or at least charmingly clever.",

            "A simple yet intelligent twist on a rather tired genre.",
            "Like so many movies with a good hook that start off promising, it can't sustain that momentum, and Unfriended winds up an interesting experiment.",
            "It was like a YouTube tutorial video that just takes like a sharp right turn into murderville. ",

            "Unfriended rises and falls not only the cutting edge technology and cinematic styling, but on the cast...Time to friend, Unfriended.",
            "Unfriended will earn chatter and consideration from the millennials featured in their stereotypes, but for most others will stumble and fall short.",
            "Unfriended is a pure distillation of exploitation cinema.",
            "It's not going to go down as a horror classic, but it should be appreciated for what it is: a stupidly fun movie.",
            "A creatively bankrupt product of the Internet generation that lacks any real sense of purpose or innovation, leaving the audience wishing we could just hit CTRL-ALT-DELETE and put us out of our misery.",
            "Kudos to director Leo Gabriadze, working from a tight script by Nelson Greaves, for creating suitable tension and sustaining it throughout the film's running time.",
            "Despite the interesting premise, the problems in this film are too infantile to truly scare audiences. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "En vez de aceptar su est\u00fapida naturaleza, Eliminar amigo prefiere huir de ella.",
            "It's clear that the cast and crew had fun with \"Unfriended,\" and that fun carries over to the audience. It's unlike anything you've seen before, but will likely be the new blueprint for the genre.",
            "While it's hardly a nonstop bloodbath, there are jolts of gory violence that provide worthy horror punch, and the dialogue is naturalistic in its use of hard slang.",
            "It worked as a way to teach teens to be more compassionate when it comes to cyber bullying, and it effectively demonstrated that whatever you put on the internet is there forever.",
            "The metatextual implications of the film serve to make the whole experience deeply unsettling in a way that ghostly jump scares never could.",
            "With some decent performances and genuine scares, Unfriended is a clever, fun horror film that you will only need to see once."

            "It's an underdog story tailor-made for the movies, devoid of surprises but touching all the same.",
            "It won't do the film any harm at the box office that Helen Mirren twinkles indomitably. She's as good as ever, but really - of all the things you want to see Dame Helen doing indomitably, twinkling isn't among them.",
            "Helen Mirren is, of course, a wonderful actress, and she brings dignity to the marvellously Euro-chic Maria, but even she can't soar above the script which veers from speechifying to banalities.",
            "Take a complex legal issue like the provenance of an art object, then throw in Helen Mirren and the Nazis as the hero and villains, and you have the dull and simplified tale of Woman in Gold.",
            "Sometimes you know a movie is going to work in about the first three scenes. This one really works.",
            "Mirren's performance gains in depth and pathos as the film progresses.",
            "Woman in Gold is just but one story in the ongoing battle for the return of stolen artwork during the Holocaust.",
            "Woman in Gold's balancing-act between sweet and saccharine is a fight to the end, with Mirren ensuring the former, and the film is (only just) the victor.",
            "I feel terrible about what happened to Altmann and her family but this movie isn't the tribute they deserved.",
            "A merely adequate tale of identity and family and the American Dream. It's a sad Hollywood tradition to take amazing, bizarre true stories, sterilize them, prune them, buff them, and smoosh them into a uniform, textureless box.",
            "May not quite reach gold level cinematic status, but it's a firm silver medal finisher, thanks to the cast and the very intriguing story.",
            " If there's a weak link, it is the script, which drifts toward tedious at times--something hard to imagine with this story. In the end, the performances and the subject create an inspirational film.",
            "A courtroom drama proves to be a stately change of pace for Reynolds.",
            "...it doesn't take any risks and it doesn't try to surprise its audience, which makes it feel more like a (well-made) TV production than a theatrical movie. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "The film comes and goes with flashbacks to show the horror of the occupation... [Full review in Spanish]",
            "[Helen] Mirren is flawless, in turns feisty and dignified, and she elevates mediocre, paint-by-numbers biopic material into something moderately engaging.",
            "Sad to say that may be the script's greatest problem: the real story involves a lot of legal wrangling that isn't terribly cinematic. ",
            "[Simon Curtis] must really thank the great Dame Helen [Mirren] for keeping this drama afloat.",
            "Woman in Gold is a David-and-Goliath story.",
            "Mirren makes us believe this is a fresh, just-discovered Third Reich atrocity. She's that present, that charismatic, that vulnerable.",
            "Mirren and Reynolds play off each other nicely.",
            "With Gold, Curtis does justice to a fascinating story with far-reaching political and cultural implications. He helms with a sensitive hand, while maintaining a healthy pace.",
            "A handsome production design and some heartfelt performances in minor roles deliver incidental pleasures but the film as a whole feels like a wasted opportunity.",
            "What Woman In Gold does have going for it is a strong performance from the always on point Mirren and a fascinating true story."

            "The legend of the Krampus, often referred to as the shadow of St. Nicholas, is a fertile one indeed, but this \"Krampus\" - a missed opportunity for anti-saccharine counter programming - isn't likely to create many new believers.",
            "Unfortunately, the narrow scope of his story - which is primarily set inside the characters' abode - makes the film feel akin to a Christmas-themed home invasion thriller minus the surprises.",

            "It's passable when it hits its stride, but too black-hearted to feel like any kind of classic.",
            "Krampus is a horror-comedy that doesn't go far enough into either of its two genres ... there's too much wasted potential to make this a true holiday horror classic.",
            "The movie sometimes gets lost in all its monster fights, but then the ominous, somewhat ambiguous ending ties everything together. Krampus may be too much for sensitive viewers, but lovers of alternative holiday viewing will rejoice.",

            "The sequel is about as far from the original source as you can get while still using the title, The Woman in Black. It is just as far away from being interesting.",
            "What's missing from The Woman in Black 2, and what it needs most and has least of all, is suspense.",
            "Director Tom Harper conveys this theme through dark, moldy-looking mise-en-scene and the uniformly sullen performances he elicits from the cast; you're more likely to find this depressing than scary.",
            "Rather than crafting a setpiece worthy of the atmosphere he's created, Harper falls back on easy, throw-the-boogens-in-the-audience's-face scares. ",
            "A respectably effective, decorously English addition to the current ghost story wave - Frightfully Insidious, as it were.",
            "Redundancy is about all it offers, despite an entirely new set of characters and a story set 40 years after the early 20th-century original.",
            "The Woman In Black 2: Angel Of Death is a profoundly frightening, relentlessly spooky film that wears how old-fashioned and traditional it is as a badge of honour. ",
            "You might be startled once or twice while watching Angel of Death, but the thrills are cheap tricks.",
            "Though well acted and shot, and set in an interesting period, the story itself seems slight and predictable - or even unbelievable.",
            "The lazy, ineptness of the screenplay doesn't help matters, and writer Jon Croker seems keener on ticking every box in a notional 'How To Make A Horror Film' manual than creating enduring characters or a truly riveting storyline. ",
            "There is nothing daringly compelling or overtly curious about the titular character nor the Eel Marsh House that the Women In Black roams around in with so-called ghastly intimidation.",
            "Still retains the original's reliance on jump scares but is a much more involving story that at least manages to keep you activated throughout its run time.",
            "Overall we found this film a worthwhile sequel to the previous film. Although the over use of 'fake' scares seemed distracting at times and became repetitive; taking away from the gripping storyline.",
            "Unfortunately, The Woman In Black: Angel Of Death has nothing in common with its predecessor as far as quality goes",
            "Filmed in virtually non-stop darkness, this sequel lacks any tension-producing shivers or fright.",
            "Overall, the movie doesn't rewrite the book of shock (despite the jump scares), but what you get is a fast-paced scare flick with an ending that could have been creepier.",
            "Angel of Death took that solid foundation and wasted it with unoriginal, lazy storytelling and a drab visual sensibility.",
            "A seriously underwhelming sequel...",
            "Not as gripping as the original -- but it works for what it is.",
            "Offering nothing new in the way of shocks and suspense and relying on tired horror tropes, this is a tiresome slog rather than a chilling sequel. A disappointing follow-up to the far superior original.",
            "Tom Harper does a truly admirable job of using atmosphere and the movie's creepy setting to give audiences a sense of unease, but moves away from the deadly force we were introduced to in 2012, which feels like a bit of a step backwards.",
            "Much of the horror boils down to heavily underscored jump scares that are neither particularly frightening nor, like the movie as a whole, memorable.",
            "Not as strong as the first outing, but it still works as a classy and refined example of how to revisit the \"vintage\" horror vibe.",
            "When things go bump, director Tom Harper duly makes us jump on cue, but the patchy script ensures the scares don't have quite the same impact as before. "

            "Abby's pursuit would appear wildly implausible, but Weigert makes it seem perfectly natural, conveying Abby's restless longings and wry curiosity, the sense that she is exploring her identity as much as fulfilling her desires",
            "A sharply observed odyssey of middle-aged self-discovery, this strikingly offbeat film may feel a little vague in its approach, but it carries a strong kick.",
            "An intriguing, independent drama with a notable performance from Robin Weigert who played Calamity Jane in Deadwood.",
            "It's not entirely plausible, to be honest, but there's an easy naturalism to the drama and a sharp intelligence behind the camera.",
            "Passon's film arcs into view as a beguilingly flighted curveball - and, as its protagonist's progress attests, the occasional one of those keeps everybody on their toes.",
            "Middle-class, very self-consciously egalitarian New Jersey is lucidly captured, especially the mildly daring dinner parties.",
            "Concussion is wonderfully shot, a confident and accomplished debut for a filmmaker with a promising career ahead of her.",
            "The film's unpredictability and irrepressible sense of humour ensure that it stays on the right side of the jaded cynicism that afflicts so many US indies set amid this sort of moneyed dissatisfaction.",

            "Not a 'great' film per se, but definitely a worthwhile telling of a heartwarmingly Disney, sports-themed tale.",
            "McFarland still warms the cockles, Costner's flawed character proves watchable and everyone, particularly the younger actors gives solid performances.",

            "Like the best sports movies, McFarland, USA makes sure the action on the field is only one part of the cinematic spectrum. And in this case, it's a spectrum worth seeing.",

            "Until the final 15 minutes of its deceptively short hour-and-a-half running time, Hero is a marvel, one of the best films to be released in the United States this year. It concludes, however, on a note both emotionally unsatisfying and morally idiotic.",
            "As they move through the martial-arts sequences, the performers leave the impression that the laws of gravity are subject to amendment. The rules of love and war -- all's fair -- are, Hero makes clear, immutable.",
            "The result is not so much a historical epic as a kind of highly determined ballet: dreamy with bloodless violence, relying less on shades of character than on magnificence of gesture.",
            "The austerity of Hero makes you realize how cluttered other action movies are.",
            "The result is both thrilling and thoughtful, offering imaginative action sequences as it considers questions of loyalty and the individual's role in history.",
            "As a technical achievement, Hero finds Zhang at the height of his powers, effortlessly expanding into complex genre filmmaking without losing his command. But in light of his earlier work, the film continues a sharp decline in urgency.",
            "One of the best Chinese movies of all time. And one of the best wuxia films of all time. Simply gorgeous. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "It is entirely possible that this is the single most beautiful film of the 2000s.",
            "An acceptable adventure that features some breathtaking action sequences and exquisite cinematography. ",
            "If it were merely lovely and silly, that would be fine, but Hero wants to be more than merely kung fu fun. It has a message.",
            "What makes Hero special is that it has so much more going for it than just the superb fight sequences. There are a satisfyingly complex plot, passionate romance, cool special effects and strong performances.",
            "Sumptuous and breath-catching, Hero blends the elegance of fine visual art with the more familiar cinematic jollies of attractive people engaged in crunching punch-ups.",
            "Zhang Yimou's Hero is a true martial arts epic -- a spectacle of movement, color and sound that will leave you awe-struck.",
            "Intoxicatingly beautiful, structurally enigmatic and decidedly brief.",
            "Gorgeous martial arts movie for older kids.",
            "Zhang weaves a complex and interesting story but the ultimate strength of Hero is its poetic beauty.",
            "When we are not left agog by the pristine production design and costuming, we marvel at the various staged conflicts, each one bringing a new level of proficiency and polish to an already overripe genre.",
            "A visually stunning martial arts epic in the wuxia tradition.",
            "Without the clarity of story, we begin to lose connection with the martial action, and it starts to seem repetitive.",
            "This intriguing, intoxicating martial-arts epic about the unification of China during the third century B.C. is a visual masterpiece.",
            "... one of the best films of its kind and one of the most beautiful films ever made.",
            "In what may be the movie's most spectacular set piece ... Zhang pits the sword against the pen and fends off war with knowledge and non-violence.",

            "Writer-directors Glatzer and Westmoreland have written a rich, multi-layered screenplay that works equally well as family melodrama and as a meditation on language, identity and mortality.",

            "What would I do if tomorrow a terrifying diagnosis dropped out of nowhere? How would I navigate the waters of disappointment and broken expectations?",
            "It's a remarkable showcase for Moore, and if you've been keeping up with her roles, a testament to her prowess as an actor. ",
            "Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland's Still Alice succeeds in being intensely moving but mainly because of Moore.",
            "Intellectually, the sadness is undeniable, but Still Alice only rarely fulfils its potential for moving the viewer.",
            "Julianne Moore's performance as Dr. Alice Howland is, simply put, one of the best I've ever seen.",
            "A desire to avoid sentimentality is admirable, yet Still Alice relies entirely on Moore's performance to mask its multitude of shortcomings. ",
            "This movie should be nothing more than a step-by-step, formulaic bore, and in many ways it is, but it's almost impossible not to be compelled by what Moore does on-screen.",
            "I thought [Richard] Glatzer's experience might give the film more insight than the usual able-bodied writer and director's view of disability. What I didn't expect from this film was how mild and polite it is about the challenges and loss Alice faces.",
            "A solid drama anchored by strong work from Moore in one of the best performances of her career.",
            "Still Alice takes an uncomfortable topic and wraps it in an easy-to-swallow format; a beautiful woman, pretty surroundings, and a happy-ish ending. ",
            "It's in the Hamptons setting, the clich\u00e9d Super 8 family flashbacks and the demonstrative piano score that the film's pretensions to overly sermonise and molly-coddle is outed",
            "The movie matches its subject with a beautifully appropriate intelligence, and is smartly structured, switching perspectives from Alice's self-preservation to her family members' dealings so imperceptibly that a decisive moment never arrives.",
            "Still Alice is hard to watch especially is you've dealt with a similar real life situation; you know there is no good outcome. But as population grows, so does the number of sufferers. It's time a brave film like this shed light on a dark corner."

            "One suspects the filmmakers aimed to bring edifying tears to audiences' eyes by the end, but with its overly sentimental approach, LOVE THE COOPERS also puts viewers at risk of hating themselves come the next morning.",

            "\"Love the Coopers\" isn't immune to a few over-the-top moments and it never met a well-trodden plot device it didn't like, but its unabashed heart and hopefulness is akin to a warm, cozy knitted throw."

            "Ricki's life may be chaotic but the film hits the high notes when it counts, in rambunctious, crowd-pleasing fashion.",
            "Without Streep at its centre, this might have seemed a flimsy confection. But she plays the rock singer with the utter conviction and fearlessness that she brings to all her roles, however unlikely they seem.",
            "Once you get past all that A-list glitz and heavyweight talent, damn if this shindig isn't lacking something in the lustre department. ",

            "The truth is that there are a handful of performers who make nearly everything they do better. Streep is one of these performers.",
            "I felt like it was 20 minutes too long.",

            "Ricki managed to get under my skin through the course of her story, and I left the cinema feeling nourished, my heart warmed and a smile on my face.",
            "In the end, the film insists that there's no contradiction between domesticity and biker jackets. As a mom, Ricki rocks.",
            "The film is a good effort from Diablo Cody, but ultimately Ricki and the Flash is just a feel good film.",
            "The combination of fantastic music, good performances, and the slightly dark undertones covered up by a feel-goodness the movie has in the end, makes for a fun watch regardless of any issues it might have.",
            "This is where Diablo Cody shines in writing complex characters that you both despise and root for at the same time.",
            "Demme plods through the familial tangles, but he tears through the music scenes with real verve. The film comes alive when Ricki is onstage; it's throwback barroom rock, euphorically delivered. ",
            "Cody's script tries to juggle too many themes and ideas, abandoning a lot of them on the way.",
            "It's not a film to write home about, but its honesty - albeit something hard to watch - is admirable.",
            "This one will be a deep cut [Meryl]Streep fans will relish.",
            "Skip this one and save your money.",
            "With Meryl at the center, Ricki's less than crowd-pleasing moments are fairly easy to overlook.",
            "None of this really hangs together. It is almost horrifying to watch someone as statuesque and strident as Streep cringing and mugging her way through a role this pathetic.",
            "It does possess the typical &#8232;energy of a Demme film, but everything connecting the &#8232;musical numbers is forced and &#8232;superficial."

            "Haynes' vision of love is not the conquers-all variety, but rather \"we'll muddle through, no matter the cost.\" It's a beautiful sentiment, befitting a beautifully constructed film from one of our era's greatest filmmakers.",
            "[Carol] gets a suitably lush treatment by Todd Haynes, who created a film recalling the best work of that noted 1950's auteur Douglas Sirk.",

            "Despite its absurd romantic storyline, and creepy crawlers, Ant-Man is a superhero film worth seeing. I don't think I've laughed so hard in any other Marvel film.",
            "Ant-Man is a surprisingly nimble, enjoyable origin story with a little-guy-saves-the-day quality that will particularly appeal to younger viewers.",
            "Is Ant-Man worth seeing? (As if my answer matters; like all Marvel movies, it'll make a mint.) Sort of.",
            "Ant-Man has its charms, but they're frequently lost beneath a story that feels like a patchwork job. It's a fun watch, but also a frustrating one.",
            "No other Marvel installment has felt as weighed down by its obligations to the franchise.",
            "[Ants are] pests, and that's just a weird place to start for a superhero, especially if he never strays too far from his origins.",
            "For a film about an extremely small superhero, it contains some very large plot holes.",
            "It's not horribly bad because I've seen worse. However it doesn't do anything special to really set it apart from other comic book films. In the end, it can be a bit forgettable.",
            "The performances of the main cast, the refreshing display of Ant-Man's abilities, Michael Pena's superb comedic role, and a weird yet dynamic finale make this a superhero blockbuster worth checking out.",
            "Ant-Man is a rousing, funny and exciting adventure, much along the same lines as Guardians of the Galaxy.",
            "All in all, 'Ant-Man' is a great little entertainment that works wonderfully as the movie it wants to be, although it's obviously very different from what Edgar Wright could have offered us. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "I thought this movie was highly enjoyable on a smaller scale than other Marvel movies.",
            "At least it was different than the typical Marvel crap.",
            "'Ant-Man' remains at the tail of the Marvel Cinematic Universe for not having managed to lower the exacerbated level of comedy on time. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "Ant-Man is an overall success. It's highly amusing, exciting, and it's great that this odd little corner of the MCU got some love.",
            "The recurring theme of the importance of a father/daughter relationship is really touching.",
            "For the sections of its 117-minute running time when it's focusing on its core plot, Ant-Man is a good time at the movies.",
            "It's all so formulaic, so intentional, so transparently focused on a specific audience to milk a specific dollar.",
            "Paul Rudd brings a boyish charm to any role he plays. His \"Aw, shucks!\" demeanor is perfect for the film's version of Scott Lang, though this iteration of the character is also trapped in a story that can't decide what it wants him to be.",
            "Paul Rudd puts the \"A\" in Ant-Man. Affable, likeable, down to earth...There is a softer heroic element to the story and film overall which is brought to life by the authentic Jimmy Stewart \"aw shucks\" persona of Rudd.",
            "Ant-Man perfectly ties into the current stage of the cinematic universe, while playing on the strengths of making a great lead character.",
            "Ant-Man is a super hero heist movie with all sorts of emphasis on super. Rich characters, a formidable villain, and fun references to the wider Marvel Universe make Ant-Man one of Marvel's biggest spectacles to date. ",
            "This feels like Marvel's most intimate film to date, and wrapped in the kind of fun that Guardians of the Galaxy delivered in spades.",
            "Even those who nitpick Marvel's approach to their movies are sure to find something to love in Ant-Man, while fans will undoubtedly adore each and every second. A funny movie with a lot of heart, it's one of Marvel Studios' best origin stories."

            "Ex Machina takes a familiar concept but presents it in a deep, complex and imaginative way that not only makes it one of the best films to come out of 2015 but certainly in time will rank as one of the best sci-fi films ever made.",
            "Ex Machina is a smart, well-crafted film that will get under your skin and have you questioning the true meaning of being human.",
            "At best, it feels more like a calling card or extended short film, but there is enough singularity here to mark Alex Garland out as a writer-director of promise.",
            "This is a smart, thoughtful, and thrilling science fiction drama.",
            "The three leads are equally effective at conveying the ethical perils posed by a future that could be closer than we are prepared to admit.",
            " It's about robotics and artificial intelligence and how you can or can't tell a human from a machine, but even more it's about bro culture and the blindness it can induce in those who embrace it.",
            "Garland's finest achievement may be his old-fashioned faith in science-fiction as an engine for profound parables about the state of humanity. ",
            "Beautifully told, stunning with occasional outbursts of humour... Ex Machina will leave you reeling.",
            "Is there a ghost in this shell or not? The only answer you get from this film is that men are easily blinded assholes, especially when it comes to something which even remotely looks like a pretty woman.",

            "The director deploys all the familiar tropes with an assured forcefulness that makes the movie crackle with a rough energy.",
            "Overall, Saving Mr Wu is a very impressive film, benefiting the most from its direction and editing. However, its narrative could have been a bit less complex. ",
            "Saving Mr. Wu is a tense crime thriller with a true story background that keeps the viewer interested and connected to the story with good characters and great performances. ",
            "It's a tight, fast-moving, entertaining cop drama that does away with the criminal mastermind clich\u00e9s to show a more realistic portrait of a kidnapping and police investigation energized by car chases, flashing sirens, and strike force action. ",
            "But for a film where the audience already knows the ending, Saving Mr. Wu manages to satisfy and excite.",
            "While all the attention is naturally on Mr Wu and Lau, the film's true breakout star here is China actor Wang Qianyuan, who is vicious as the criminal mastermind.",
            "This blend of abduction thriller and police procedural ... is an entertaining genre exercise that methodically reshuffles its timeline to fend off predictability.",
            "Gleaming, elementally machined, Ding Sheng's \"Saving Mr. Wu\" stars Andy Lau in a crackling true-life thriller ... [T]he inevitable showdown... is cleanly choreographed."

            "As someone who neither hungers for yet another incarnation of this character nor understands why anyone would, I watched in subdued bafflement.",
            "The mystery subplot lacks the ingenuity of the greatest Holmes stories, but McKellen excels, switching effortlessly between the reclusive beekeeper with a faltering memory and the elegant younger detective at the height of his powers.",
            "It's a gripping little tale, to be sure, but it's more than that. Somewhere in its tangle of timelines, false starts, and red herrings is a great truth about the unsolvable mystery of the human soul.",
            "Even those who've read the book can be startled by what happens in Mr. Holmes, while they're being moved by McKellen in a role he's come to late, but with his customary elegance.",
            "Only the wonderful work of Ian McKellen manages to give authenticity to a film that falls far short of achieving its objective. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "It's a successful character study, as well as a clever mystery, even if it isn't all that gripping as a whole.",
            "Mr. Holmes is understated and intimate, and it examines one of the most famous fictional characters through an interesting new lens.",
            "Mr. Holmes just about gets the job done thanks to McKellen and Parker, but too many mediocre elements ensure this affair is a sad waste of a strong concept.",
            "Mr. Holmes is an exceptional and unique addition to the vast collection of Sherlock Holmes' journeys, rich with respect for its predecessors and bold in its thoughtful and reflective approach.",
            "It is far from a perfect but I enjoyed it.",
            "McKellen, delivering his inimitable drawl, is inevitably the star attraction here. He doesn't have to speak to have his presence felt, he can frown and find audiences laughing, and Jeffrey Hatcher's script sparkles in his hands. ",
            "Condon and Hatcher were just the men to bring this atypically humanistic vision of Sherlock Holmes from book to screen, and Mr. Holmes is a movie I'll be itching to revisit for years.",

            "Just go see it. This film is intelligent and well-constructed, brilliantly acted and visually beautiful. Do not go into this expecting a Holmes-and-Watson solve-the-case Baker Street whodunit; this story is more about the man than the mystery.",
            "You may never have to leave the drawing room for this mystery, but at least that room is tastefully and beautifully decorated.",
            "A beautifully portrayed story about aging and redemption that anyone can appreciate, no matter their level of Holmes mania.",
            "McKellen succeeds in spades, charming us in one moment with his crotchetiness and breaking our hearts with his fear and weakness in another. ",
            "Despite meticulous acting, Bill Condon's film fails to bring emotional heft to &#8232;the tragedy of the aging and gradual disappearance of the human intellect.",
            "It is almost wholly down to McKellen that this Bill Condon-directed picture is still worth catching.",
            "Even hidden under pounds of make-up and doddering more than he needs to, McKellen turns in a touching performance. ",
            "Mr. Holmes isn't another fast-paced adaptation of the character that pop-culture has become used to recently, but a quiet character piece that is radical in its introduction of a revisionist history for the character. ",
            "If the idea of a Holmes narrative penned by anyone other than Sir Arthur Conan Doyle gives purists pause, Cullin and Condon have done their homework. "

            "It's not dumb often enough. Combine that with a lead character who abandons his appointed life-saving duties at the precise moment he's most needed, and you have an uneven flick that flirts with disaster more than embraces it.",

            "Admittedly, this does run out of steam in the second half but the film channels Dostoevsky amusingly, has echoes of both Michael Douglas's Wonder Boys and Allen's own Crimes And Misdemeanours -- and saves up a neat twist for the end.",

            "Coming out of Irrational Man, it's hard to shake a sense of purposelessness.",
            "A Woody Allen cynical meaning of life film about a burned out philosophy professor."

            "Solace isn't a Silence of the Lambs sequel in which Hopkins gets to reprise the role of Hannibal Lecter. But he comes pretty damn close in this ludicrous murder mystery, which is stuck somewhere between a bad season of Dexter and a dated crime flick. ",
            "The directorial pyrotechnics keep Solace from \"dragging\" in a narrative sense; the very real boredom it nonetheless elicits is more existential. ",
            "Staggeringly silly and visually disordered, this unfortunate misfire has been kicking around Europe and elsewhere for a couple of years under different titles, and it's easy to see why.",
            "As leftovers go, \"Solace\" retains a fair amount of flavor, thanks to high-end ingredients.",
            "This paranormal cops-versus-serial-killer procedural is never not ridiculous, but it's often entertaining as well ...",
            "An overly convoluted tale drowned in creepy but essentially meaningless violent images and dry performances.",
            "Solace, a film that had the foundation in place to be an OK movie only to squander it all on recycled tropes and strained dialogue and clich\u00e9d twists. ",
            "Solace will certainly come and go from the pop culture conversation in the blink of an eye.",
            "But then nobody brings a touch of class to nonsense quite like Hopkins, an actor who can make the most bizarre of lines seem plausible.",
            "Hopkins remains watchable, but despite a supporting cast that includes Colin Farrell, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Abbie Cornish, this overblown, parapsychological thriller gets sillier the longer it goes on, and eventually becomes tedious.",
            "Anthony Hopkins really is a prime example of that rare breed of actor whose magnetic presence can lift a film a few notches. With Colin Farrell also on board, the film boasts a strong cast that makes you wonder why the film bypassed cinemas here.",
            "Though it has a decent premise and a great cast, this supernatural thriller can't seem to overcome its crushingly mediocre screenwriting and filmmaking techniques. It's highly forgettable. ",
            "Similarities and connections are one thing, but Solace seems to grasp at straws and force-link everything when it isn't necessary. Solace is this damaged and lackluster film that sometimes tip-toes in the category of a beautiful disaster.",
            "Solace is one of those films that is just average at best across the board.",
            "The film plays a lot like too-little-too-late, a sometimes-clever thriller with a couple of performances that rise above the material.",
            "SOLACE may not be the movie you rush out to theatres to see, but it is hard not to at the very least give it a chance, especially if you are a fan of the cast.",
            "One of those dark and plodding serial killer flicks that feels like it has come plodding out of 1995. ",
            "The whole enterprise ends up as soulless as it is silly.",
            "I'm deeply envious of Anthony Hopkins' future seeing abilities. If only I had his powers I could have avoided wasting my time with this terrible psychic serial killer drivel.",
            "This silly potboiler might have been more at home on the small screen as a high-concept episode of a police procedural. ",
            "A frustratingly flat effort, and one carried along by an Anthony Hopkins performance where the actor's lights are visibly switched off, creating a dramatic gap where urgency usually resides.",
            "The intriguing but uninspired Solace can't escape the clutches of '90s serial-killer thriller d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. ",
            "End up being better than it probably deserves to be, but most of the time, that's because Hopkins can really do no wrong ... except in picking his movies.",
            "It joylessly coopts the hoariest stylistic tics and narrative tropes from your run-of-the-mill 1990s thriller. "

            "What makes Mann such a fascinating but paradoxical film-maker is his grandiose approach toward material that often seems utterly formulaic.",
            "Tiresome CG visualization of data transferring between computers twinkles repetitively and music swells while the camera focuses on button keystrokes and scrolling code.",
            "It would be better seen as a satire of Mann's own method, where the details and processes of criminality make way for the machinations of a plot run amuck.",

            "It's still early in the year, but Blackhat's careless, convoluted script and lazy performances could easily earn it a spot on the list of worst movies of 2015.",
            "It's ugly, but purposefully so. Mann shoots his characters like they're a ragtag band of warriors... It's both dizzying and disorienting; creating an urgency that's maintained throughout the lengthy run time.",
            "Unfortunately, the sluggish Blackhat is another stiff serving of the cyber-techno crime genre that is becoming so awkwardly prevalent in modern-day synthetic actioners.",

            "The writer, otherwise unknown to me, is one Morgan Davis Foehl, and one can certainly say that this particular script is emminently Foehlish. It's also as dull as reading computer code."

            "Baumbach's intelligence and uniqueness are evident in While We're Young. On the whole, though, the movie seems like it got lost on its search for some creative and human truth.",

            "Rarely has a film more eloquently captured the universality of human experience.",

            "Under a less masterful hand, you'd be dying for a fistfight, a sex scene or a gunshot to shatter the calm. But Koreeda makes thrilling the rich inner lives of four young women trying to navigate rocky emotional terrain in the wake of their father's death.",
            "It's a movie that, by its serene final scene, changes its viewer. You leave happier, honored to have been, for two hours, part of this family.",

            "Koreeda tends to focus on feelings, attitudes and the general characters of his protagonists instead of specific incidents, and this style reaches its peak in this film",
            "The film itself is pleasant enough, but you get the impression you wouldn't want to see a prequel. Kore-eda shows thirst, not by filming a desert with parched people, but by filming an oasis, and the happiness of people finally able to drink. ",
            "The drama ends up diluting itself to give space to a pleasant story that only conveys feelings of tenderness and innocence. [Full Review in Spanish] ",

            "It really is filmmaking at the highest pitch of intelligence: a work teeming with skill both cinematographically and dramaturgically. ",
            "When its repressed emotions finally come to the surface, it's devastating.",
            "Our Little Sister, a lovely example of vintage Kore-eda, explores tensions great and small that exist between different generations of a fractured family.",

            "This story, which grows richer the more you think about it, is a rueful acknowledgment of the fact that few of us can.",
            "If the subject matter is familiar, Haigh approaches it in good faith - avoiding both sentimentality and cynicism, and seeking out fresh insight rather than settling for cliche. ",
            "The naturalistic approach of Haigh and his actors makes 45 Hours a memorable screen experience, filled with subtle details and clues to the relationship.",
            "To know is not the same as to possess, and at any rate, possession is never permanent.",
            "Keenly observed... A career-best performance by Charlotte Rampling culminates in a final moment that is powerfully stunning.",
            "Playing like the chilly counter to romantic melodrama Brief Encounter, Haigh's 45 Years is a sharply observed portrait of how time is mistakenly honored or acknowledged as proof of the foundation between two people.",
            "One of the most shining examples of depth and power in independent filmmaking.",
            "This film is slow, intense, sometimes painful, but also very beautiful. ",
            "Rampling in her prime and so deserving...watching her unravel almost imperceptibly, elegantly, heartbreakingly, is a masterclass.",
            "What we are really watching is not just the love and joy of a 45-year commitment, but the toll as well.",
            "'45 Years' captures a lifetime of drama in one particular week. ",
            "45 Years is exquisitely acted with Rampling giving a tour-de-force performance of such subtle power it is breathtaking.",
            "Haigh incorporates wry observations about relationships, both humorous and tragic, while intelligently reflecting on aging. Sadly though, 45 Years never quite reaches the promise of its premise.",
            "Props to director Andrew Haigh for his tremendous achievement.",
            "45 Years is arguably the most heartbreaking drama of the year, but it is worth every moment of sadness.",
            "[Andrew Haigh] treats the older, straight, married couple who are the film's focus with the complexity that other filmmakers reserve for characters under 50. ",
            "... the beautiful thing about 45 Years is its unique ability to keep you guessing about, well, everything, without ever revealing the whole truth.",
            "Visually stunning and exquisitely acted, 45 Years transcends its own occasional sleepiness to become one of the more poignant British dramas in some years.",
            "A bravura exemplar of mature storytelling where the temptation to wrap things up in an epiphanic, cathartic ending is waived for a more truthful view of life's tainted flux.",
            "Can be described as a slow-motion psychological horror film that doesn't shed a drop of blood.",
            "Tom Courtenay's modulated and fine-line balance of regression and fear is brilliant. Charlotte Rampling is quietly devastating.",
            "Andrew Haigh manages to not only show how couples remember their joint history differently but also the inevitable betrayal that individuals feel when they realise that what they thought had happened didn't happen in the way they thought."

            "The memories of the original Mad Max series are intact. This is not more of the same. Fury Road takes you down a different trail.",
            "Yeah, I get it. I admired the film a lot. But did I love it? Well...",
            "A machine that roars at full throttle for two solid hours. ",
            "George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road upends all expectations-about how action sequences are composed, what themes a blockbuster can contain, or who a film's actual protagonist can be-and puts most other filmmakers working on this scale to shame.",
            "It's hard to do justice in words to Fury Road's nonstop, breathtaking action sequences.",
            "There's an amazing sense of scale and depth to the cinematography by John Seale, who came out of retirement for this one, and also a brilliantly varied color palette.",
            "Although it's cold, violent and visceral you can also feel the underlying elements of hope, loyalty, reverence and redemption. ",
            "Fury Road is a masterpiece of mayhem which cemented Charlize Theron as one of the greatest modern action stars and there's no experience quite like it.",
            "This is exactly the type of grand cinematic spectacle brimming with passionate, zealous ideas that's been sorely lacking from the mechanical operations of formulaic tent poles.",
            "Films like Mad Max: Fury Road do not come along often. Director George Miller delivers an epic and visual cinema art film that celebrates survival and hope in a bleak and deranged universe.",
            "Wall-to-wall visceral action, insane practical stunts, highly stylized production, with a thoughtful take on the apocalypse.",
            "Fury Road is the literal definition of controlled chaos. It's an amazing, full-tilt assault on the senses ... the most brilliant piece of mayhem to ever hit the screen.",
            "In addition to being furiously entertaining and having new protagonists, watching this blockbuster is like going to the desert to see a special show by Monster truck, Slipknot and Cirque du Soleil. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "This movie was just bonkers.",
            "It was great. I mean, this is how to do an action movie.",
            "Mad Max: Fury Road will be the film to beat for a long time coming, and the new high-water mark against which to judge action and blockbuster filmmaking. This is, quite simply, how it's done.",
            "It's a rare film that engages the mind while rocking the body. Miller's vision of a world consumed by its own greed, where water, gasoline, and bullets are the most precious commodities, seems even more relevant today than it did 30 years ago. ",
            "As close to riding a rollercoaster you can experience while sitting in a movie theater.",
            "The entirety is a delicious assault on both your visual cortex and auditory system - a giant orchestral blend of machine engines roaring and wheels peeling combined with a booming overture of drums and guitar.",
            "Furiosa and the women are the heart and soul of Fury Road, championing female life and autonomy into something that could have easily been a popcorn flick for bros.",
            "Arty, gorgeous, exciting, compelling, and poignant all at once.",
            "It's something awesome. It's all hot orange and brown, the glamour of the punishing desert wind, it is completely OTT and it can't go five minutes without an explosion and I loved it.",
            "Miller's magnum opus is proof a film can be fueled by meaningful social subtext and still kick ass. It's evidence that all-out action need not be reduced to \"dumb fun.\" It's brilliant. It's glorious. It is Maxcellent.",
            "Fury Road seems aimed at dudes who fetishize chrome and steel, but Miller plants seeds of bolder, more incendiary ideas within the bro-fantasy."

            "Child 44 is bland in every aspect, which is a shame as the source novel could have been turned into an exciting movie if it had the right directorial hands to guide it (as well as a more eye catching title, Child 44 sounds pretty boring in name alone).",

            " It's rare that a movie more than two hours long is criticized for being too short, but there's just so much crammed in, and the speedy clip of events doesn't permit the audience to gain a deep empathy for anyone involved. ",

            "It's a shame that a movie about one of the greatest screenwriters who ever lived is so uninspired. A story like this deserves more gravitas, fewer guffaws. ",

            "Singh's bullet-headed Bajirao, forever charging into uncharted physical and emotional terrain, marks another fine showing from one of Bollywood's most versatile leads: we spot exactly why this bad boy commands the loyalty, even lust he does.",
            "The central pair of defiant lovers are never particularly convincing as convention-busters, nor are they as appealing as the rooms they inhabit or the clothes they wear.",

            "Bhansali's imagery and craft are perhaps second to none, but his storytelling continues to resist evolution.",
            "It is cinema on a grand scale, larger-than-life in terms of visual pleasure, but without the compelling narrative or emotional depth to make it memorable.",

            "It's definitely one of the year's best.",
            "The narrative is linear and predictable, but the film comes alive when Ranveer Singh and Priyanka Chopra are in the frame. For Singh, it is possibly the role of a lifetime and he plays Bajirao with an ease and confidence that radiates on screen.",

            "It's very hipster-cute.",

            " What's captured here so well is the solipsism and confusion of being an adolescent who's forced to deal with death before you're ready to, an aspect of life so many films have trouble representing on-screen.",
            "The film has great art direction and soundtrack selection, but nothing can disguise or improve its white-guy narrative of \"Person unlike me who changed my life for the better.\"",
            "It's a mixture of quirk and heart-breaking sadness that features plenty of humor -- only to pull the emotional rug out from under its audience.",

            "Character issues aside, the film tries far too hard to add eccentric touches to the visual language.",

            "Dying Girl has all the trappings of a twee nightmare, but it's a deeply moving film.",
            "As well as being one of the most sickeningly overrated films of the year, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is one of the worst.",
            "[Cinematographer] Chung Chung-hoon invests ordinary teenage bedrooms and suburban high-school cafeterias with a magic and mystery that don't disguise the film's shortcomings--but sure make them easier to forgive. "

            "What this film is is a good period drama about people living their lives. ",

            "This is a poignant, simultaneously jubilant and deeply sad championing of singing like nobody's listening.",
            "Frot is Marguerite, and Marguerite is Frot - her central rendition is the extraordinary performance of a lifetime, capturing the beauty and innocence behind the voice of a peacock.",

            "Catherine Frot's performance as the titular title character is notable and layered, and the film provides a wonderful supporting cast. ",
            "What keeps this together is the glowing, sensitive performance from Catherine Frot (The Page Turner), who plays the deluded singer with an earnest grace.",

            "In the march to the end, \"Miss You Already\" grinds its gears through the late stages of cancer, following a predictable and cliche path. Each scene is a yank on the heartstrings, a poke in the tear ducts, its intents and machinations plainly obvious. ",
            "The biggest success here is how much emotion the film manages to evoke while still maintaining a sense of joy. ",

            "Barrymore and Collette often seem like they're fighting with the tacky material, but it's a fight they ultimately win; however many times you roll your eyes at Jess and Milly, you can't help but get caught up in their tearjerker of a story.",
            "Catherine Hardwicke's comedy drama could be filed under that cringeworthy industry category, \"chick flick\"... But the two leads are the no-nonsense Drew Barrymore and there is a waspish script by Morwenna \"Absolutely\" Banks in its favour.",
            "As a pure tearjerker, it gets the job done, and the movie's final half hour is a masterclass in weepy conclusions.",
            "A lackluster reboot of chick flick extraordinaire Beaches. I kept waiting for \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" to start playing. Alas, it never did.",
            "Across the board, the performances are terrific: superbly understated and fabulously real.",
            "As much as I disliked Miss You Already, I have to admit that I was rather taken with Barrymore's performance as Jess.",
            "There is nothing apologetic about the way [Catherine] Hardwicke depicts Milly's vanity and neediness. The Twilight director delivers a realistic portrait of someone who fears losing everything.",
            "Bring your tissues and your bestie along for this raw yet beautiful film -- it's one you shouldn't miss.",
            "Miss You Already is commendably brave in its unsweetened depiction of cancer, and in fact this is probably the most honest depiction of the disease I can remember seeing in a cinema.",
            "You can see it all coming, but it's wonderful. ",
            "Miss You Already is a small step up from a TV disease-movie-of-the-week, due purely to the forceful performance of Toni Collette as Millie, a successful PR executive with a hip musician husband and young kids who discovers she has breast cancer.",
            "Milly is no saint, but she grows on you.",

            "Sponge Out of Water has a frenetic, Looney Tunes pacing and a head-spinning, surreal story that makes you wonder whether it's aimed at children or stoners.",
            "Almost every line is a zinger, which can be appreciated in a state of total sobriety: it's a non-stoner stoner film - and very funny.",
            "The film moves like a pyjama case full of angry weasels, and finds ingenious ways to cram every scene with just one more loopy, disposable gag or slapstick thwack. It may not be the year's best animated film, but it's almost certainly the most.",
            "It's a simple premise with proven appeal, giving director Paul Tibbitt and his team freedom to construct a film where just about every element of the storytelling exists to be parodied and undermined.",
            "I had a blast with it and found myself laughing consistently throughout the film.",
            "t is definitely not for everyone and it was out there but I was charmed by it and it kept me engaged.",

            "Was it weird? Very much so. Was it entertaining? Surprisingly so.",
            "... rarely are stupidity and absurdity so hilarious. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "There may be no good reason for such a surreal and crazy story about a sponge living in a place called \"Bikini Bottom\" with a starfish as a best friend to be quite this funny or endearing. ",
            "People who love the TV series do so for the silly details, hilarious villains, the awesome cameos and the way Patrick shows that ignorance can be bliss. As long as we get that, it is fine. ",
            "Delightful and funny in a cheesy, silly way, [the film] is a kind of cinematic sugar rush. ",
            "The second feature film based on the long-running animated series, Paul Tibbitt's The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water is actually much better than it looks.",
            "SpongeBob fans -- children, sober and non-sober adults alike -- will be singing the theme song together by the movie's end.",
            "The gags are delivered to rapid fire, so you're only half way through groaning at one before the next has made you smile.",
            "This is SpongeBob's second outing on the big screen, and this time the filmmakers employ some glorious new 3D animation to give the sponge a little twist.",
            "A time travel sequence is an eye-searing mind-melter, while the scene in which Plankton literally enters SpongeBob's brain mixes the sickly sweet esthetic of the Candyland board game with the nightmare surrealism of 1938's 'Porky in Wackyland.'",
            "Sponge Out of Water strikes an effective balance between goofball humor that will entertain the kids and adult-targeted humor of a more wink-wink nature.",
            "This elaborately plotted family film takes that goofily optimistic, bucktoothed sweetie SpongeBob SquarePants out from the animated briny depths of Bikini Bottom and up to the real, or at least fantastically computer-generated, reality of dry land.",
            "I was surprised by how watchable I found it.",
            "Tibbitt and his crew cleverly blend ink-and-paint animation, CGI and live action, and the result is great fun, slyly calculated to convulse the kiddies and keep their parents alternately chuckling and laughing out loud.",
            "The true take-away: fast-food-obsessed sea animals don't fry-cook up a sizzling comedy. Too much of the film lacks zip, invention and anarchic fun, offering instead forced and strained silliness."

            "Guilty is an epic look at two gruesome killings, made worse by a series of wild miscarriages of justice. ",
            "For all its positives, Talvar fails to keep that distance, and therefore compromises its ability to be an impartial, unbiased chronicle of what is India's most sensational murder case.",

            "One of the bleakest whodunnits to grace our screens for some time, for all its wit and intermittent playfulness, this slice of Noida noir is full of compromised characters.",
            "A tense, taut and thrilling piece of cinema.",
            "The film has a Rashomon like narrative, putting different viewpoints and storylines in place and whetting your appetite with each reveal.",
            "A tightly written narrative and mostly rational view of the investigations ensure Talvar is an edge-of-the-seat, engaging thriller that seeks to shock its audience.",
            "A deep conviction that Rajesh and Nupur Talwar have been wronged by the Indian justice system has led Vishal Bhardwaj to write his most sharply focused and coherent screenplay yet.",
            "Straight away, Talvar is super-sharp, a sword swipe at Bollywood's song-and-dance, mehendi-fuelled escapism.",
            "At one level, Talvar is a classic whodunit and a sharply observant police procedural... But there is much in this inspired-by-true-events film that reinvents the generic elements that constitute its narrative spine."

            "Somehow, Vikander sells it all, not with braying and big gestures, but with vulnerability, sincerity and the sort of ethereal realness that can't be quantified. More, please, more.",
            "Though the movie at times feels oddly unfinished (you wonder what Miranda Richardson, in a tiny role as an Oxford professor, is there for), it's artful and moving.",
            "As a story, it evokes a word that no battlefield nurse would ever apply to her experiences: sterile.",
            "Testament of Youth isn't a typical biopic; it's a heartfelt manual on forging ahead.",
            "In what is a well-acted but fairly typical prestige period drama, it's Vikander's nuanced performance as the resolute but still-vulnerable Vera who gives the film its depth.",
            "This is Vikander's film and she is very good here.",
            "Beautiful, moving yet grim, Testament of Youth is very obviously awards-bait, but one that finally gives Alicia Vikander an opportunity to shine.",
            "Emotional, enthralling and well made, this timely cinematic sensation shines through its leading lady who befits the indomitable woman she portrays.",
            "One of the best of the year so far for sure.",
            "Glides with sorrowful grace, pitching at a respectful and tear-inducing tone.",
            "Those who enjoy a biopic will enjoy this film. Also, those who like a good period drama - the attention to detail and faithful recreation of Edwardian Britain will delight and educate in equal measure.",
            "Vikander, last seen in Ex Machina, perfectly embodies all of these complex traits without allowing the performance to disintegrate into mere histrionics. ",
            "Grim but not unwatchably so.",
            "With expert cinematography and the help of Vikander's powerful physical expressiveness, he (Kent) manages to paint a much-needed picture of women during wartime. Even better, it's not all pretty.",
            "Coolly directed by James Kent, the movie's anchored by the grave, delicately featured Vikander who's able to convey youthful romanticism without ever seeming childish.",
            "Nimbly tip toes around potential schmaltz, but still delivers the expected quota of emotion.",
            "An exquisite piece of work that shimmers with authentic emotion.",
            "It's very nicely, if a little safely made, and gives you a compelling sense of how blithely an entire generation was squandered.",
            "The actors are all extremely fine, with special credit extending not just to Vikander but to Colin Morgan in wonderfully open-hearted form as a fellow member of an all-but-lost generation.",
            "As this is a film about a witness bearer, it does well to capitalize on Vikander's perpetually observant eyes, which convey tenderness, intelligence, shock, incomprehension, comprehension, resiliency, and finally wisdom.",
            "This incredibly emotional film looks at one young woman who saw both her brother and fianc\u00e9 volunteer to fight in the trenches.",
            "There's much here that's impressive and affecting, with Vikander portraying Vera as a complex mixture of fiery individualist, swoony romantic and crushed innocent.",
            "Kent seems to mistake Brittain's metaphysical substance for girlish sentimentality, and if this movie had starred someone like Keira Knightley in the lead, it might have been unwatchable.",
            "The Bible says 'Blessed are the peacemakers' (Matthew 5:9) but many more monuments have been built to honor soldiers and generals than to honor those who fought just as bravely and hard for peace. At least this film honors one of them."

            "I've seen it thrice. It has not palled.",
            "There's something magical about the malaise which raises this above mere misanthropy - a heightened sense of fragile life that perhaps only puppets could hope to achieve.",
            "Though fellow fatalists Woody Allen (when in Dostoevskian mode) and Todd Solondz occupy similar territory, the arrival of Kaufman's stop-motion drama Anomalisa reiterates the uniqueness of [Kaufman's] surreally skewed metaphysical inquiries.",
            "From the brilliant mind of Charlie Kaufman comes the best film about hotel-related boredom since Lost in Translation. But with puppets. ",
            "Will undoubtedly make its viewers think, though the highly existential vagaries and graphic sexual nature may cloud its more fascinating insights into human behavior.",
            "Anomalisa was an admirable stab at illustrating major depression, though I found it easier to appreciate as an accomplished stunt than a serious drama.",
            "It can be seen by the solid animation work and thematic concerns about postmodern man's individualism, but it's not a big deal. The result is a little soft.",
            "Anomalisa is a worthy addition to Kaufman's formidable filmography.",
            "The results are as magnificent as they are human.",
            "The longtime aficionado of Kaufman's work might suspect there's more up his sleeve, only to find themselves disappointed.",
            "It's deceptively simple for a Kaufman film, but there's a devastating sense of truth in its melancholy portrait of mid-life ennui.",
            "These oh-so-recognizable puppets are so human and that's what makes Anomalisa so subconsciously unnerving and haunting.",
            "Fun, no. Compelling, yes. Anomalisa is filled with more longing and palpable loneliness than many other live action films registered this year. ",
            "A somewhat cynical yet thought provoking stop motion animated film.",
            "A late-breaking dream sequence is perhaps a slice of Kaufman too far, threatening to derail this beautiful journey through its sheer lack of subtlety - thankfully though, a compelling, hugely affecting final sequence brings it all back with panache.",
            "In choosing a medium that distances audience from onscreen subject, Kaufman has drawn the two closer together, telling a universal human story with puppets. ",
            "Anomalisa might be bizarre, surreal and far out, but it always feels paradoxically real, grounded and deeply true.",
            "Even if you're used to Kaufman's quirks, Anomalisa will still be unlike anything you've ever seen before.",
            "Anomalisa no es una experiencia ligera, pero Kaufman ha probado que sin importar qu\u00e9 tan difuso sea el subtexto, si hay algo que podemos entender es lo que significa ser humano.",
            "For all its naturalism and attention to detail, the conceit of Anomalisa, though beautifully executed, smacks of gimmickry.",
            "It's another of Kaufman's ingenious works that instinctively understands the sometimes bathetic human quest for divinity amid an overarchingly mundane social landscape. ",
            "Anomalisa is not just a character study about one self-defeating man who can't see the forest for the trees, but one that rather overtly hints at all the other character studies (and voices) worthy of our attention."

            "Sims probably uses a setting-sun metaphor more than necessary, but otherwise his decisions are immaculate and his film should hold audiences in thrall.",
            "Great performances ... elevate the film from merely likable to poignantly satisfying.",
            "Takes a tough subject and amiably rides it out into the Outback sunset. It's a wry film that remains upbeat without betraying its rough-around-the-edges cast of characters.",
            "\"Last Cab to Darwin\" provides an emotionally textured look at one older gent's decision to take his waning life into his own resolute hands.",
            "Smartly directed by Jeremy Sims, this sweet-hearted film mostly manages to avoid triteness even as it casually packs an emotional punch.",
            "A sentimental road drama that reflects the real-world effects of cancer: pain, anger, withdrawal, and isolation.",
            "There's no denying that audiences will enjoy Sims' film, laughing and crying at the exact moments it wants them to, but Sims having his heart in the right place can't entirely mask the mawkish and cheesy nature of the story.",
            "An extraordinary character study... [Michael Caton] is compelling from the first scene and only grows more so as the film unfolds.",
            "Last Cab to Darwin makes good use of its new medium with beautifully ugly depictions of Australians.",
            "Full of sun, beer, and the restless souls found along the highway.\"",
            "Gorgeous cinematography from Steve Arnold captures the otherworldly beauty of the Outback as Rex and Tilly bisect the continent. ",
            "Jeremy Sims' Last Cab to Darwin is a formulaic but still heart-tugging road movie.",
            "It's a potentially gimmicky premise, but Cribb and director Jeremy Sims refuse to condescend to it.",
            "The actors never let artifice get in the way of the movie's deep well of human feeling.",
            "Sims insists on always playing it safe, never taking chances, which ironically, is the very thing his film clumsily preaches against. ",
            "The spiritual [journey], though, is the real heart of \"Last Cab\" as Rex learns the meaning of life, real life, is to not spend it alone but with your loved ones.",
            "Last Cab to Darwin works best when it steers clear of ideas that aim to create a big splash. ",
            "This certainly isn't the most original film to come along (Ramin Bahrani's \"Goodbye Solo\" immediately springs to mind), but it's so beautifully cast and directed (by Jeremy Sims) it's a joy to go along for the ride.",
            "A dying man is awed by the wonders of life and of love.",
            "It's too long by about half an hour... But there's an awful lot to like about it as a touching ensemble piece.",
            "Caton is a perfect fit; he is touching, tender and a little bedraggled, emoting with a worn-out visage that looks like the 71-year-old has been marinated in beer and left in the sun to dry.",
            "Taking on the controversial issue of euthanasia with a \"she'll be right mate\" attitude, whatever conviction Last Cab to Darwin lacks is replaced with a down to earth charm personified in Michael Caton's lead performance.",

            "While admittedly contrived at times, it doesn't really matter, as Sims again reveals himself as an 'actor's director' and eases lovely work out of the whole cast."

            "Turns out people can get really irritable after seeing heaven.",
            "Although this well-meaning film may appeal to its intended audience on a spiritual level, the result is a sluggish, clinical, largely dreary portrait that tends to mistake trauma for drama.",
            "It fails to create a satisfying narrative with a true arc that pays off; it's too caught up in explaining its minor details to focus on the big picture.",

            "May strike a welcome chord with the evangelical groups at whom it's obviously aimed. But for others the ploddingly preachy picture will seem more like a stint in purgatory, if not someplace even more uncomfortable. ",
            "The movie captures the drama but not the passion.",
            "The titular experience is buried in favor of a repetitive, heavy-handed barrage of bedside hospital prayers.",
            "While there are fine, restrained moments exploring faith as both comfort and struggle, there's almost no way to portray a vision of Heaven literally that doesn't feel like somebody's telling us exactly what he thinks we want to hear.",
            "A staggeringly uneventful movie made for an audience to which I obviously do not belong. I'm frankly at a loss to convey how little happens during 90 Minutes in Heaven. ",
            "Flatlines in its last half hour and barely putters along in the hour and half before that.",
            "Long and often nearly dramatically inert. Perhaps had the film spent more time detailing those heavenly ninety minutes, the offering might have worked better, or at least been more interesting. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)",

            "For the most part, the quality of the dignified, understated performances here prevents the picture from tipping into cloying sentimentality.",
            "No pretension or faux-poeticism - just a well-made domestic drama.",

            "Ostensibly, a lovingly made study of homemade cooking and old-fashioned values, this beautifully played drama also contains a mordant denunciation of the lack of compassion that shapes Japanese attitudes to social stigma.",
            "Anything Kawase directs is not without interest and even when offering up something more accessible and middle of the road like this, there's an artistry to her work as always",
            "With An, director Kawase Naomi has managed to make a stellar bittersweet film. She could have made it a sugary pancake, but some of its stuffing caught me by surprise, and the film as a whole is a dish I very much recommend.",
            "Although \"Sweet Bean\" does not succeed fully in examining the issues it presents, it is, nevertheless, a film of extreme beauty, which will definitely entice the audience senses, and particularly the appetite. ",
            "Sweet Bean is brimming with humanity, featuring characters that aren't normally seen onscreen.",
            "Soft, gentle, and kind ... until it knocks you down on the ground and guts you like a fish. Despite what some may say, \"Sweet Bean\" is far from saccharine schlock.",

            "In short, a warm film, with sensitive characters, without bombastic exclamations. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Kawase doesn't require firecrackers or tragedy to keep audiences mesmerized over a story that may seem to be light. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Prolific Japanese director, Naomi Kawase, constructs a beautiful and sensible tragicomedy that reaches a limited, but welcome experience. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Once we've seen the blossoms and admired them, seeing them again is less thrilling - and so is the overall impression left by An.",
            "An is flat as a pancake, but lacks the paste: it strives to be an intimate, incisive portrait of three lost people learning to find some direction in their lives, but [Naomi] Kawase's appetite for schmaltz swallows everything before it.",
            "Sweet Bean is no fairy tale, and unexpected revelations add layers of emotional complexity and metaphorical suggestions. But the film is a heartwarming, albeit bittersweet, experience.",
            "Sweet Bean is a film that does its conventions right but gives nothing impactful as a result.",
            "The action moves at the pace of the seasons; but for those who relax into its reflective mood, it offers much to savour.",
            "Sweet Bean senses how even the tiniest change in the basic ingredients of one's life can yield considerable rewards.",
            "Echoes of classic Japanese cinema resound all over Sweet Bean, but its tugs at the heartstrings feel calculated in a way that Ozu's and Naruse's never did.",
            "A subtle treat, Sweet Bean is an unusual and interesting gentle pleasure.",
            "It may feel a little too calculated and cloying at times but Sweet Bean still manages to tug successfully at the heartstrings."

            "Completely reliant on the warmth and goodwill generated by its stars (rather than, say, its writing), this AARP-oriented dramedy strikes all the familiar chords.",
            "It's all very cosy and undemanding, but Keaton and Freeman are such amiably engaging screen presences you will probably enjoy spending the time in their company.",
            "It is hard to extract much of a high old time from a production like 5 Flights Up when the stakes involved are so exceedingly low.",

            "Trite, obvious, and two-dimensional.",
            "It's good for the performances of Freeman and Keaton, but the story feels forced and repetitive in parts. [full review in Spanish]",

            "Malala is highly confident, well spoken yet cheeky, and the story is powerful and inspiring. ",
            "HE NAMED ME MALALA feels really impersonal (despite Guggenheim's attempts to eek out an engaging film), and it does her story a major disservice as it succumbs to the male perspective it tries--and fails--to denounce.",
            "Guggenheim's portrait of teenage Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai is remarkable in terms of access to its subject's life.",
            "It's a shame that Guggenheim's slickly produced documentary examines such an important and fascinating story with such underwhelming results.",
            "Guggenheim takes a wholly admiring view of Malala and her family, and you wouldn't want it any other way.",
            "Even beyond Malala, there's plenty of interesting material to work with here, such as the inside explanation of the Taliban's appeal to the uneducated populations. But He Named Me Malala is simply unable to present it in a coherent fashion.",
            "Malala is a unique, surprising individual, who's part of a larger history of standing up to oppression.",
            "It's so disappointing to see [Malala] saddled with such a perfunctory, trite, and gushing tribute that barely scratches the surface of this remarkable woman.",
            "A lengthy but fast-paced mixture of animated sequences, dramatised reconstructions, news and specially shot footage, He Named Me Malala is a well-made, easy to digest documentary-lite.",
            "Touching, likeable and often life-affirming, HNMM keenly balances its themes and subject matter, and most importantly fully allows the warmth and grace of its subject shine through.",
            "Stirring, respectful and eulogising rather than polemical. ",
            "What shines through is her calmness and optimism as she continues along the long, slow path back to full recovery.",
            "... the title and narrative makes it inadvertently about the man behind Malala, her father Ziauddin Yousafzai, that by the end of 87 minutes will leave you questioning just what is the real story behind the this almost mythical Malala.",
            "He Named Me Malala is well-made, inspiring, and full of moments that will touch your heart in ways many documentaries of this nature won't.",
            "The wonderful thing about He Named Me Malala, a documentary made by the American Davis Guggenheim, is how much it tells us that we didn't know. ",
            "What's in a name? As He Named Me Malala posits, maybe nothing, until the rose chooses to embody what it means to be a rose.",
            "[He Named me Malala] is barely 90 minutes long, but I could have watched more.",
            "Guggenheim fails to shine a light forward, it's a good thing Malala is there to speak for herself and for the hopes of new generations.",
            "Hollywood may be taking its sweet time making the Wonder Woman and Captain Marvel movies, but filmgoers don't have to keep waiting on a Superwoman to see an inspirational heroine on the big screen.",
            "A beautiful, thought-provoking piece of film-making which demands to be seen.",
            "A few too many shots of his subject receiving awards and meeting famous people, however Malala Yousafzai is an extraordinary woman and, no matter how her story is presented, it's most definitely worth hearing.",
            "Despite's its perceived shortcoming, He Named Me Malala is still a powerful documentary that offers us a glimpse - but not a look - into the life of one extraordinary young lady.",
            "Davis Guggenheim's solid and moving documentary He Named Me Malala gives us the background of a story that shocked the world, but could have been more rigorously made."

            "It's got a fast pace and screwball spirit, and is the closest thing Baumbach's done to pure comedy since his peerless debut picture 'Kicking and Screaming.' But there's a lot more going on here than just laughs.",

            "Filled with heart-warming moments, combined with a witty script, and a great cast, the film is one of Baumbach's more light-hearted outings and he and Gerwig make it work.",
            "[Greta] Gerwig has, with [Noah] Baumbach, written a role that she was born to play: her slightly spacy delivery serves as a disguise for Brooke's razor-sharp observations.",
            "This is one of the funniest films Baumbach's ever made, and the hope is that Gerwig adopts some of Brooke's can-do spirit and churns out more movies like this for us to feast upon.",
            "Near the end, the story becomes central in a moral quandary that Baumbach and Gerwig are smart enough not to resolve with a tidy answer. Is it stealing? Does it matter?",
            "By a weird fidelity to a specific vernacular, Mistress America is an invented landscape not unlike Star Wars. The soundtrack has an '80s feel, the setting is contemporary and Greta Gerwig channels Katherine Hepburn. ",
            "Mistress America is, despite it's wobbles and preference for humour over depth, a delightful diversion from Baumbach's typically weighty output and a star-show for the pair of performers at its centre.",
            "I loved Kirke and Gerwig's megadramatic line readings. Everything they do is underlined.",
            "This short film (less than 90 minutes) starts out entertainingly enough but soon wears out its welcome on the way to an ending suggesting Baumbach and co may love this unbridled character more than we do.",
            "It's wordy, smug and, eventually, a tad trying. Kirke, however, is terrific.",
            "Mistress America is definitely larger than life. ",
            "Mistress America doesn't fully succeed with what it sets out to do - renewing a tired comedy sub-genre for a new and more cynical generation. ",
            "Baumbach has an eye out for the self-rationalizing machinations of creative types; it's funny, but also bitter.",
            "Even if [Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig's] latest project together feels like an afterthought when compared to Greenberg and Frances Ha, it's also their most consistently amusing, cleverly self-critical film to date."

            "Director Leslye Headland's follow-up to Bachelorette addresses big issues like the role of sex in relationships while delivering refreshing laughs thanks to a supporting cast who make their value known; Adam Brody's cameo is a revelation.",
            "Perhaps Headland is afraid of her films being too unlikable for audiences, or this an attempt to legitimise herself within the mainstream. Because, ultimately, why sacrifice all this smart, perceptive modernity for a finale hewn of Hollywood clich\u00e9?",
            "Headland's script sometimes feel more like a 2015 zeitgeist-capsule than an organic piece of comedy, but the mix of sophistication and unabashed raunch has a definite light charm.",
            "Sleeping With Other People is an updated -- and raunchier -- take on the When Harry Met Sally rom-com premise: can a man and a woman ever be best friends, or will there always be just a troublesome frisson of attraction?",
            "Writer-director Headland's screenplay is sharply observed in places and yields a few memorable set pieces (including a brawl in a restaurant that shocks a pregnant woman into going into labour.) It is also utterly predictable in its plotting.",

            "An unfortunately hideous affair. Toplined by two skilled comedic actors who both deserve more than the trite script awards them, the crudity builds throughout, resulting in a film that's deeply unpleasant. ",

            "Director James Wan (Saw, The Conjuring) may be a dab hand at things that go bump in the night, but action is not his strong point.",
            "... Furious 7 is a fitting sendoff for the franchise, not only to the many millenials who grew up with the films but the rest of us who admire them for their penchant for rebellion, diverse casts and, yes, their foolishness.",
            "Great and familiar cast, excellent script, superb production values and the direction is tight as a drum. Can't say this is the best film of the franchise, because so many of them have been excellent. But it's easily the most daring.",
            "The chemistry between Walker and his costars, his friends, gives this muscled sledgehammer of a film some surprisingly gentle moments that you'll think about hours later.",
            "The true shame is that, despite zero constraints on the magnitude of potential action sequences, few of the extravagant set pieces actually contain anything conceptually new.",
            "Fast & Furious 7 certainly is the Ultimate tribute to Paul Walker; some of the scenes just make you want to cry...",
            "After losing one of the stars in 2013, Furious 7 brings emotion as they always have.",
            "Essentially an action-packed and thrilling adventure with a thread of humanity.",
            "Despite the faults, Fast and Furious 7 is every bit as entertaining as its predecessors with an emotional weight that holds the film together for all the right reasons.",
            "There's a sincerity here that packs a surprisingly emotional counterpoint to the action.",
            "Watching Furious 7, you get the distinct impression that, when faced with a creative choice, the filmmakers paused to ask themselves, \"What's the most insane, over the top thing we can do here?\" Then they went ahead and did that. ",
            "[Delivers] entertaining stunt action and [combines] it with a fun plot that not only keeps its sense of humor, but also contains a good deal of heart and emotion.",
            "If you leave logic at the door, buy the biggest popcorn bucket the theater has to offer, and want to have fun- Furious 7 is the film that will take you on the ride you're looking for.",
            "\"Furious 7\" is probably one of the most ridiculous non-stop action rides you'll see this year. It's also probably one of the few action films which will also reduce you to tears by its end. ",
            "Convoluted as the story is, the way they say goodbye to Paul was well done and really very poignant.",
            "\"Do we really need another Fast and Furious movie?\" No. No we do not. We also didn't need to land on the moon. Nor did we need to create the 1967 Ford Mustang. We did it because it was awesome and we could, dammit.",
            "We want these films to go on forever, and perhaps they will; but, for now, this is a fine film to ride off into the sunset to.",

            "Delivering a disarmingly natural performance, much like Piku, Padukone is the cog that keeps everyone else turning.",

            "Ripped straight from the pages of your therapist's notebook, Goodnight Mommy is a thoroughly terrifying fairy tale with a killer twist.",
            "Goodnight Mommy is increasingly unnerving and meant to completely throw off even the most die-hard horror fan, but the film is less horror than it is a psychological trip through clues, truths, lies, fantasy and reality.",
            "Goodnight Mommy might be a flawed film, but it remains an original and refreshing take on a tired genre. Its fantastic production values make it a highly enjoyable watch.",

            "Goodnight Mommy works because it is a very tight, solid film.",
            "The acting was great, it had a lot of visual interest, but they gave away the twist too early. Knowing the twist at the beginning of an hour and a half long film makes it feel incredibly dull. ",

            "Less fantastical than much of Luis Bunuel's work, this 1964 adaptation of Octave Mirbeau's novel demonstrates that realism and surrealism aren't the polar opposites some might think.",
            "Sadly, the intervening decades seem to have weakened Mr. Bunuel's powers. His new adaptation of Octave Mirbeau's Diary of a Chambermaid suffers in comparison with the strange but memorable version Jean Renoir did with Paulette Goddard in 1946.",
            "The Diary of a Chambermaid was a crucial turning point in Luis Bu\u00f1uel's career because it would officially usher in the French period of the director's later years.",
            "Impressive in the film is the graceful, mature manner in which the characters subtly reveal the dramatics of the story.",

            "Second-tier compared to Bu\u00f1uel's masterworks, this film is worth seeing because it is his. ",
            "A wonderfully vulgar film from the masterful Spanish director Luis Bunuel, Diary of a Chambermaid is an adaptation in spirit of Octave Mirbeau's novel and Jean Renoir's 1946 film.",
            "Remarkably subtle and perceptive straightforward narrative on the rise of French fascism.",
            "Diary of a Chambermaid is a piercing examination of the bourgeoisie and its obsessions. Bu\u00f1uel shows us the horrifying actions and results with varying amounts of drama and humor like only he could.",
            "In the end, it's not the chambermaid's sellout that shocks us but the all-absorbing power of the bourgoisie (Bunuel's longtime enemy) against which it seems futile to revolt.",
            "Utterly stunning.",
            "A riveting, if not minor, Bunuelian masterwork.",
            "Interesting version of the story as slightly surreal poltiical tract by Bunuel.",
            "A fascinatingly bizarre minor work.",
            "Seems less and less a product of the great Bunuel and more and more like an imitator.",
            "The themes of obsessive desire, inhibitions imposed by society and ridicule of conventional bourgeois values dominate Bu\u00f1uel's work, and Diary of a Chambermaid is no exception to that.",
            "Bu\u00f1uel's is a darkly acute view, occasionally relieved by sardonic Swiftian humor and forgiving only of the innocence of childhood.",

            "Disturbing is the film's apparent conviction that the surefire way to a woman's heart involves lots of candles and a mani-pedi, the sort of notion that isn't so much cute and old-fashioned as it is acutely offensive.",

            "It must be pretty neat to make a movie that mostly consists of people telling you how chivalrous and morally right you are and how much everybody loves you, but that's no excuse for making it this boring.",

            "This low-budget, faith-based film -- with a cast of mostly unknowns -- is little more than a made-for-cable movie. But it offers an endearing look at what it's like to fall in love -- not lust.",
            "Old Fashioned feels like a familiar work of juvenilia, something similar to those terribly insightful relationship dramas your college roommate wrote on lonely nights.",
            "[Old Fashioned] raises some interesting questions, but in the end it's not credible.",
            "Old-fashioned is right. Like how the Taliban is old-fashioned. Behold some pretty despicable passive-aggressive othering of women in the name of 'respect.'",
            "Old Fashioned longs to return to the good ol' days, before the scourges of online dating and one-night stands sapped all the sweetness from modern courtship. ",
            "Hipper than your typical faith-based drama, but the romance is such chemistry-starved hokum that the movie doesn't deliver. ",
            "Old Fashioned is excruciatingly dull. It's like watching a movie in slow motion. I had to force myself to stop looking at my watch, because it was discouraging how little time had gone by whenever I checked.",
            "Any masochistic joy that can be derived from watching the film owes to seeing it take its bullheaded conceit to its logical, artless extreme.",

            "The rackets and scams it exposes are all real, the result of extensive research. It's a gripping thriller with good guys and bad guys, but everyone in it is a victim, including Rick Carver. Bahrani's achievement in this film is breathtaking.",

            "Shannon is superb at being contemptible and intense, tossing about vein-popping speeches that attempt to justify his immoral and regularly illegal approach to making money.",
            "Bahrani's most effective film to date, 99 Homes features a particularly vibrant Michael Shannon engaged in a modern perversion of American greed.",
            "Bahrani effectively and systematically portrays the awful things people will do, betraying themselves and others, faced with impossible economic conditions. ",
            "The film is not a pleasant one to watch, but it is absolutely electrifying on all fronts.",
            "As comes as no surprise, writer/director Ramin Bahrani breaks down the door of our collective moral compass with this cat and mouse thriller of corruption versus conscience.",
            "It's generally positive, but it is sad that it remains just an estimable proposal when it sometimes shows that it could have been much more than that. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "Its great cast and effective drama, at least for the majority of the film, are undeniably compelling.",
            "Bahrani's v\u00e9rit\u00e9 gets somewhat lost among his amplified quasi-thrillery plot beats, but this low-key master continues to grow with a wider scope and commanding actors. Don't miss 99 Homes.",
            "While 99 Homes does suffer from some contrived plotting and character development, Bahrani has also produced a timely portrait of the human cost of the housing crisis.",
            "99 HOMES features award-worthy performances, an original premise that speaks so much truth, but contains a climax that is hard to like, leaving you with a bad taste in your mouth.",
            "Directed and co-written by Ramin Bahrani, 99 Homes is a dreary story worth telling, unfolding through realistic, powerful acting all around.",
            "Anchored by strong work from Michael Shannon, it's a fascinating examination of the fragile nature of a home owner's market, but it also starts to run out of steam in the second half. ",
            "As a movie with some lessons for us, 99 HOMES may not be the most transcendent, but it is practical, useful and fairly disturbing.",
            "At once realistic and fabulistic, 99 Homes is Bahrani's best film.",
            "Tight as a drum writing and terrific performances from Garfield, Shannon, plus Laura Dern as Dennis's mother, represent a solid investment of your time.",
            "It's a film worth seeing just for the story, but with the superb performances, it makes a film you need to see.",

            "After grim comedy comes the threat of grim tragedy. The ending is a do-or-die confrontation with the elements, powerfully presented.",
            "Gummi and Kiddi's interactions tend toward the comical, but the rock-steady widescreen cinematography by Sturla Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen lends the proceedings a deadpan aura.",
            "This small, peculiar story becomes strangely involving; it's a movie that sneaks up on you, right up to the bursting-dam emotion of its extraordinary closing scenes.",
            "This powerful volcanic landscape needs a complimentary style and Hakonarson brings one: long takes with little camera movement, almost a series of tableaux. It's similar to documentary but with a more poetic touch.",
            "The shafts of humour don't shine nearly as brightly as they should.",
            "This is a film that allows you space to think, to make connections -- and to wonder what is going on and why. The actors are often silent; they are like people we might meet at any time, and being with them is challenging and rewarding.",
            "The stupid rivalry and the hate-protection relationship between both brothers result in a tender film with certain touches of humor. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "A meaningful drama with sparse moments of comedy, Rams is essentially a tale of determination and forgiveness. ",
            "Writer-director Gr\u00edmur H\u00e1konarson spins this idiosyncratic yarn with such sly, deadpan grace you don't see what's coming.",
            "H\u00e1konarson maintains a tone as chilly as the Icelandic countryside, but still offers touches of dry, dark Nordic humor, and just when the film can't get any bleaker, it ends on a note of almost shocking tenderness. It's quite a ride for such a quiet ride.",
            "It's a rare beast of a film that can provoke genuine gut laughs alongside moments of true anguish, but Rams achieves both, with undeniably greater emphasis on the latter.",
            "Although shot through with humour, Rams is undeniably bleak. But don't let that put you off. It's captivating and one of the freshest films you will see all year.",
            "Rams isn't a film for mainstream audiences but cin\u00e9philes will appreciate its execution, beauty, minimal scripting and the deft performances by all.",
            "Amid the grand themes about love of the land and kin are some wonderfully bizarre comic moments. One to savour.",
            "Rams is the kind of film whose evident craft belies its lack of adventurousness; its virtues are mostly predictable, its revelations far from revelatory as it plods inexorably from one situational hurdle to another.",
            "Plays out as a droll comedy that held my attention throughout.",
            "The film's gorgeous cinematography captures a world that couldn't feel more distant from a life of smartphone notifications and open office structures.",
            "Although Rams never feels like nature porn, Sturla Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen's lensing is always stunning.",
            "Offers a masterclass in minimalist film-making that lacks for nothing in colour and character.",
            "Rams isn't the film that is going to definitively put Iceland on the world cinema map, but it is the boldest invitation yet about the distinctive tone of their cinema.",
            "H\u00e1konarson doesn't lessen the harshness of the characters or the landscape, but still manages to find beauty in the way they are.",
            "It never becomes deep, but its tender view of its richly drawn characters makes it beguiling to the end.",
            "It's a delight to encounter a film that quietly, gradually creeps up on you; which, without seeming to expand a huge amount of effort in so doing, puts a smile on your face.",
            "Deadpan Scandi-humour runs through writer/director Gr\u00edmur H\u00e1konarson's carefully crafted tale, and there's no doubting the film's empathy for its protagonists. Shame, then, that the final-reel shift into tragedy feels misplaced."

            "Ruffalo is generally wonderful at finding the tone and mood of a character and holding to it; here he has to bounce about, but again he latches onto a consistent energy that makes Cameron a singular life force.",
            "\"Infinitely Polar Bear\" is a much-needed reminder that the realm of film is still a place to encounter something other than comic-book scenarios.",
            "Forbes' sweetness of tone and wise casting makes \"Infinitely Polar Bear\" irresistible.",
            "If the scariness of Cam's illness is portrayed through rose-colored glasses, the realism of the characters shines through in dozens of other small ways.",
            "It's ultimately a feel-good movie with some poignant moments ...",
            "Ruffalo lives into the character of Cam with a level of honesty and vulnerability that won't much surprise those familiar with Ruffalo's indie work.",
            "Ruffalo is incredibly charming, and while Cam's behaviour is often erratic, he is also sweet, funny and endearing. Happily, the same can be said about the film.",
            "Everything about screenwriter/director Maya Forbes' (The Polka King) film is doused in realism. From the family dynamic to the handling of mental illness.",
            "The most interesting aspect of Infinitely Polar Bear is how writer-director [Maya] Forbes brings both the perspective of her own childhood and retrospective insights as an adult and parent in the film.",
            "The heart and sweetness at the film's center help Polar Bear subvert the expectations of the average issue-based drama.",
            "Might have been a very different and far-inferior outcome if not for the casting of a superb Ruffalo.",
            "I love the movie's fluidity, but a bit more narrative asymmetry might have given the story a more interesting shape.",
            "The story is too close to home for this to seem like anything but a vanity project-one whose familial hostility is thinly veiled at best.",
            "Forbes uses the strength of her cast and story of togetherness and persevering through various family and personal struggles to give us a portrait of unique experience driven by its fantastic performances and character relationships.",
            "A film about sacrifices, yes, but also about goodness and the unpredictability that is the human feeling. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Growing up and growing strong with a bipolar dad may have seemed like an impossible mission. But, clearly, writer/director Maya Forbes' lovely film shows she has moved forward.",
            "It is the fact that Infinitely Polar Bear provides an opportunity for audiences to engage in these considerations, effortlessly, that the film will win over hearts and minds.",
            "There are genuine pleasures to be found in the film's playfulness, but they come at the expense of what would seem an inherent gravity.",
            "Ruffalo gives one of the most appealing performances I've seen from an actor in recent years.",
            "Accessible, entertaining and well acted.",
            " Writer/director Maya Forbes' autobiographical fingerprints are all over Infinitely Polar Bear, a disarmingly joyful recollection of being raised by her bipolar father in the 1970s...yet the film feels universal. ",
            "Infinitely Polar Bear features an endearing turn by Mark Ruffalo and will bring a smile to your face.",
            "First-timer Forbes's earnest resolve to demystify bipolar disorder prevents her film from establishing a satisfying story arc. Ruffalo is good though."

            "Until Janis Joplin came along. Her scratchy, whiskey-bruised voice arrested a generation and, however accidentally, carved a place for those without a Y chromosome. Little Girl Blue tracks her rock takeover to the very end, up to her tragic death.",
            "Puts the music front and centre, where it belongs. A must for fans.",
            "The music remains astonishing. Every performance seems like a career highlight, and it doesn't seem possible that she could have been so intense all the time. ",

            "The Bride might be inspired by Mary Shelley, but its nature seems to draw from Robert Louis Stevenson. Aping the latter's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, this feels like two separate movies battling for the upper hand, with the end result basically being a tie.",
            "The Bride wields its fanciful melodrama in such a way that it has gotten to the heart of something universal and wounding before you've even realized it.",
            "A rare return to Bride of Frankenstein territory, The Bride isn't helped by the obvious comparison to its much-better predecessor",

            "With so many classics to his name, the legendary Werner Herzog need not apologize for helming Queen of the Desert -- it's just shocking that his name is attached to something as arid and uninspired as this stillborn drama.",

            "My Golden Days isn't perfect, but much like memories of our own youth, I'm not entirely certain it is meant to be, and as such the film becomes a far more emotionally powerful endeavor because of this.",
            "Glossy, and distractingly nostalgic, My Golden Days is Desplechin at his most pleasant and potentially least ambitious, but enjoyable nonetheless.",
            "Though consistently amusing, the narrative direction and central themes of My Golden Days are too confused for it to serve as anything more than light entertainment.",
            "The highs of infatuation and lows of betrayal are genuine and acutely felt by characters who are striving to discover themselves while being both profound and shallow simultaneously. ",
            "The details of the story aren't particularly compelling, but Desplechin's telling casts a spell that's curiously thrilling, as the film seems to be constantly reinventing itself as it goes.",
            "A charming French film about young love, about the beauty of youth, about the best years of life...",
            "Using offbeat humor and emotional sensitivity, My Golden Days is an ode to youth culture and its enchanting unknowns.",
            "Although it has the offkilter rhythm of actual memories and employs stylistic flourishes like 80s-era split-screens, My Golden Day\" is never hard to follow.",

            "[PODCAST]Here's a film with a young, powerful, and complicated female lead (played by Lou Roy-Lecollinet). Arnaud Desplechin should be a household name. ",

            "The film is an undeniable pleasure, with a wicked sense of humour and real heart.",
            "Desplechin allows the search for lost times to unfold with a light touch, a vivid sense of Paris in the 1980s and 1990s, and a cast who bring freshness and vitality to the most familiar ingredients of a first great love. It has been well worth the wait.",
            "Desplechin's haunting and heartbreaking rumination on the growing pains of growing up adds up to a story with strong connective tissue that's well worth seeing.",

            "A hugely charismatic turn by Pene&#769;lope Cruz is wasted.",
            "Without Cruz, this movie might not have added up to as much. But with her vivid presence, it shimmers and throbs.",

            "Cruz gives a big-hearted performance in a very demanding role.",
            "Pen\u00e9lope Cruz is luminous and with the force of her charisma holds the film together as the suffering madonna, unbelievably cheerful and selfless throughout her protracted ordeal.",
            "Featuring one of Pen\u00e9lope Cruz's greatest ever performances, Ma Ma is an exemplar of what a classy director can do with potentially soapy material.",

            "About as cheery as getting prepped for surgery.",
            "Ma Ma suffers from melodrama without catharsis. ",
            "Cruz keeps things engaging but she's really up against it in a film that's mawkish, melodramatic and sometimes comically misjudged.",

            "Heartstrings, prepared to be tugged at vigorously.",
            "The endless smiles, tears, group hugs, quirky fantasies, inspirational speeches and, worst of all, musical tributes (Magda has a singing gynaecologist) steadily wear down our own will to live.",
            "Pah to logic and believability!",
            "Littered with dark, comedic moments that derive from the harsh realities of the protagonist's predicament, causing situations where you're never quite sure if you're in a position to laugh.",
            "Not unlike Ali MacGraw in the equally apocryphal Love Story, the closer our heroine inches toward death's door, the more physically attractive she becomes. Phooey!",
            "This is an old-school tearjerker, designed to get audiences sniffling in the dark.",
            "From Spain, this drama grapples with some enormous issues without getting too heavy about them. It's emotionally wrenching without ever feeling sentimental.",
            "While it's fun watching [Cruz], in the end Ma Ma is a wasted opportunity."

            "Robert Carlyle is excellent as the lugubrious and downtrodden Barney, but as he makes his directorial debut here his rhythm on this deadpan comedy is erratic.",
            "Not as clever as it wants to be, some comic bits stumble and the ending is ridiculous, although Carlyle and Thompson give it their best shot.",
            "Ray Winstone's irascible English copper all but blows steam out of his ears, and Ashley Jensen chews whatever scenery hasn't already been trampled.",
            "Robert Carlyle's directorial debut is a miserable, tone-deaf hash of black comic clich\u00e9s.",
            "Ably supported by a strong cast including Ray Winstone and a nearly unrecognisable Emma Thompson, there is certainly some directorial skill in [Robert] Carlyle's bones.",
            "Carlyle achieves a consistent wry, shaggy dog tone that works on low-key terms. Fans of its stars will be pleased; fans of murder comedies have seen both better and worse.",
            "Making stylish use of its Glasgow locations, Carlyle's black farce about a serial killer moseys along in fine enough fashion, but it suffers from a fatal lack of laughs.",
            "Whilst the ending is rather silly and possibly too neat, it is a rather enjoyable film so bring your blackest humour to watch this.",
            "The Legend of Barney Thomson has a few redeeming features scattered throughout, but for Carlyle it's much too bland and undefined.",
            "The film's final showdown may be stylised and as ludicrous as they come, but by then we've become caught up in Barney Thompson's endearing, exaggerated lunacy.",
            "Robert Carlyle makes his directorial debut with The Legend Of Barney Thomson and a decent job he makes of it too.",
            "There may be no improvement of the human condition to be found here, but there's a pervasive solidarity - like a ratty sofa whose dilapidation is inseparable from its coziness.",

            "Thompson steals her scenes and provides many of the comic highlights, while the screenplay gradually becomes detached from reality and loses its emotional grip.",
            "Uneven dark comedy about a barber and a serial killer.",
            "The movie's relentless grimness renders the characters into caricatures, each more miserably shallow than the last.",
            "It's fine, and on occasion it even flirts with looney tune greatness, but mostly it's held back by predictability.",
            "Over-the-top and irritating without being funny or clever enough. If only the audience were to have as much fun as the actors seemed to be having.",
            " It's not entirely successful, but \"Barney Thomson\" enjoys a great deal of oddity.",
            "Macabre comedy featuring Emma Thompson as a besotted (but somehow beloved) harridan should attract fans of cheeky British (er, Scottish) crime dramas.",

            "Although it offers more of an intellectual than emotional experience, 13 Minutes is still an enjoyable film, particularly if you are interested in this period of history.",
            "In spite of a sound production, 13 Minutes has a difficult time creating total engagement with its audience. ",
            "13 Minutes is a more hopeful counterpoint to Hirschbiegel's harsh portrayal of his homeland in Downfall, and a welcome homecoming for its director.",
            "Authoritarianism, and the silence that permits it, pops up from time to time in history, and 13 Minutes is a timely look at the heroism it takes to break that silence.",
            "Back in [Hirschbiegel's] element, he delivers a sturdy but routine biopic, one that works best as a political radicalization process film."

            "Based on the first book in Lewis Grassic Gibbon's A Scots Quair trilogy, British cinema luminary Terence Davies's Sunset Song takes the beloved Scottish classic and bestows it with his own distinctive creative signature. ",
            "It has taken Terence Davies 18 years to bring Sunset Song to the screen, but it was worth it.",
            "Davies is in no hurry to tell this intimate story, and he handles it with his customary sensitivity, confirming his status as one of Britain's finest contemporary directors.",
            "As a saga, the film waxes and wanes, but Davies' feel for the painterly landscape and the exquisite construction of whatever is within his frame never wavers.",
            "It blooms with moments of astonishing beauty: a yellow frenzy of springtime trees; a still room where the light slants in the window like a reaching hand; a desolate landscape, impossibly green.",
            "Like Davies' best work, the movie employs classical rigor - perfectly symmetrical, painterly landscapes and interiors - with unexpected postmodern touches.",
            "Sunset Song is a lamentation on time passing, the loss of a way of life, and a love song to its inhabitants' attachment to the land. ",
            "There's a lot to love in Sunset Song, but there could be even more with a more focused, less comprehensive narrative. ",
            "Icy and warmly nostalgic, sprawling but deeply intimate, gorgeous but glacial.",
            "Poetic narration, complex characters, and not a shortage on melodrama make Terence Davies' coming-of-age tale worthy of consideration.",
            "What remains - Davies' way with a score and the performance of Kevin Guthrie as Ewan Tavendale, Chris's beau, are the true highlights of the picture.",
            "It's so long that by the end you're praying for the sun to set on this a good hour before it finally does.",
            "At the end of a very long two-and-a-quarter hours not really understanding why certain characters have decided to do certain things... well, it's frustrating to say the least.",
            "There is no such thing as a minor Terence Davies.",
            "Much of the Scottish tongue is impossible to understand, but where the words lag, the pictures fill. Davies' direction makes Sunset Song meaningful.",
            "The film seems determined to hit us over the head with the notion that ingrained ways of life are unchangeable: especially a culture that keeps women down.",
            "The film's rugged scenery is both sublime and brutal, mirroring the extremes of experience within the narrative.",
            "Sunset Song's story is told through moments of gorgeous, dramatic transition. But it will be remembered for its profound intimacy.",
            "Terrible things happen to the people in this film, but the story is captivating nonetheless. Although the story is a downer, there is a kind of noble enduring spirit shown by Chris throughout the film, and that helps a lot.",
            "Terence Davies is a clear-eyed nostalgia artist specializing in the retrieval of the mood and the color of the past. Sunset Song... seems like the culmination of his work. ",
            "Hardcore fans of veteran director Terence Davies (Distant Voices, Still Lives) will likely lap up every sumptuously lit frame of his slow-moving, lovingly composed adaptation of the Lewis Grassic Gibbon novel...Everyone else, bring a pillow.",

            "[It took] Terence Davies 18 years to bring this adaptation of Lewis Grassic Gibbon's novel to life. To show my appreciation, I've seen the film twice; and it's just as brutally devastating and moving second time around.",

            "[Jay Cavendish] seeks to move beyond the boundaries of basic survival, a trait that Silas eventually learns in this slick and often heart-warming tale of unlikely paths crossing.",
            "There are lessons about love to be learned, bloody shootouts, a sweet fur coat worn by a heartless bounty hunter, and a grim montage of still shots for everyone that meets their demise",
            "The Scottish director John Maclean makes his feature-film debut here, delivering a beautifully shot picture in which the rapidly rising body count belies the sedate, thoughtful pace.",
            "Slow West is not badly paced-not at all-but it does present a challenge to the viewer. It's not slow so much as wandering, and you have to be willing to roll with deeply weird moments interspersed with violence and tragedy. ",
            "Slow West is the feature debut of writer-director John Maclean. [...] it is also among the more unique modern westerns in the way that it plays around with traditional western tropes and conventions.",
            "By turns a beautiful, surprising and haunting work.",
            "The tone of the film, a darkly absurdist frontier odyssey, recalls both the films of the Coen Brother and the novels of Cormac McCarthy. ",
            "This is an often ferociously entertaining and substantial debut.",
            "Slow West derives its strength not only from its multi-layered story but also from its spectacular visuals of a geography, which simultaneously seems subliminally awe-inspiring and menacing.",
            "This quirky, confident Western belies the fact it is the director's first feature, and marks him out as one to watch.",
            " It may skimp on its characters, but with a mostly successful amalgamation of various tones, Slow West is a beautiful and bold shot in the arm for the genre."

            "Although Gameau's film includes a fair amount of science, he and his helpers sweeten the film's statistics, delivering them in clever, accessible ways.",
            "Gameau builds his case well, and by the end of the painfully dorky musical number, you may be swapping your smoothies for berries and plain, full-fat yogurt.",

            "In its substance, the film is an effective call for individuals to reduce sugar intake while exposing the places those sugars may reside.",
            "With its peppy, pop style, complete with silly, colorful special effects and animation, this documentary should prove accessible to school-age viewers, who might profit the most from its frank information about sugar's effect on their minds and bodies.",
            "[Gameau] does have an undeniable way of grabbing your attention, and it's a lack of that that seems to be half the problem when it comes to our sugar-packed diet.",
            "It's important to probe the Western world's overconsumption of sugar, but Gameau's attempts to do so while being hip and fun feel condescending and trite.",

            "A quietly profound study of the unfathomable nature of conflict.",
            "The funniest and most profound film about war since Dr Strangelove.",
            "It is tremendous storytelling: engaging, intelligent, and with some lovely touches.",
            "The film is a character study, a chamber piece with incursions, a morality play with a thoughtful sense of its own boundaries.",
            "Though the themes about war and peace will be familiar, this is good, old-fashioned storytelling - with a high level of craftsmanship.",
            "Zaza Urushadze's slow-percolating drama finds a simple farmer navigating a perilous truce between warring factions in the 1992 border war between Georgia and Estonia. ",
            "You'd find that in investing 87 minutes of your time for \"Tangerines,\" you had viewed not just a poignant anti-war film, but a beautifully realized cinematic parable.",
            "Pitch-perfect performances and Urushadze's careful unwinding of the story ensure Tangerines is never less than riveting.",
            "A thought-provoking, tiny-but-tough Oscar-nominated Georgian anti-war drama.",
            "It's powered by casually great, lived-in acting, particularly from Lembit Ulfsak as the old man under whose roof the gruff Chechen mercenary and his sensitive young Georgian foe find themselves facing off.",
            "The wonderful, sensitive Tangerines is a plea for tolerance -- an appeal which should always be heard. It is a must-see.",
            "An oustanding and emotional movie. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Ulfsak, by all accounts Estonia's Olivier, is the pivot of the all-male cast, his mournful face bringing an intense gravitas to proceedings in an small, but engrossing and handsome film.",
            "It represents the horrors of war in a small town setting. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "A conventional war drama that is perfectly made and acted. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "The simple nature and sobriety of this tale, along its bittersweet ending and the transparency of its message, make it, in the end, an homage to anti-militarism cinema.[Full Review in Spanish]",
            "An elegant but unexciting anti-war film, poignantly told in the form of a humanist parable.",
            "Tangerines explores the absurdities and complexities of the ensuing nationalistic, territorial and religious fall-out with an admirably simple set-up.",
            "A melancholy morality tale that beautifully illustrates the folly of conflict and blind hatred.",
            "This is a film that mines the profoundest truths from the simplest of stories and underlines the sheer absurdity of the situation.",
            "The anti-war message is not new but the film delivers it eloquently and with quiet, insistent dignity. And sadly, it's a message that's still not being heeded.",
            "Although set in a specific time and place, the film's message about human life is universal. And director/writer Zaza Urushadze makes his points without being heavy handed, overt or politically demonstrative.",
            "It's not often that you watch a film stripped of all the usual bells and whistles, let alone one that packs the emotional punch of Zaza Urushadze's Tangerines."

            "Unpretentious and it goes down easy, like sweet tea brewed by sunshine.",
            "That the creaky romantic comedy \"Big Stone Gap\" attracted such a large ensemble of talented name actors only makes this country-fried turkey feel like an even more notable miss.",
            "It's tempting to say \"Big Stone Gap\" is greeting-card pretty and sweet, but that doesn't quite fit because these days greeting cards seem to have developed a bit of an edge. \"Big Stone Gap\" is edge-free.",
            "The plot itself has little momentum, and what should feel dramatic instead feels inert.",
            "Trigiani's heart is in the right place and the film is very obviously a labor of love that isn't very heavy on plot but makes you feel like you're right at home.",
            "If you really want an unpretentious, sweet romantic movie, you deserve a whole hell of a lot better than Big Stone Gap.",
            "With Big Stone Gap, Trigiani sets out to crack the cycle of sentimental melodrama by reminding us that adults still dare to dream and sometimes even follow through on achieving those hard-to-articulate wishes.",
            "Despite its all-star cast, Big Stone Gap falls short of what it aims to be: the next great love story. There are a few notable comedic moments, however, and fans of big screen romances may find the journey worthwhile.",
            "Flat comedy about small-town '70s life lacks laughs.",
            "Brutally mediocre.",
            "Sure, the script can be simpler than a diner menu. And at times the nostalgia seems manufactured like the goodies at a Cracker Barrel gift shop, but...Big Stone Gap proves to be...a nice change of pace from the summer popcorn-movie season.",
            "Trigiani doesn't push the material into any energetic directions, but she does capture the sway of the town, better with atmosphere than dramatics.",
            "Nothing feels believable in \"Big Stone Gap,\" a bungled, charm-free look at small-town life in the South in the late '70s.",
            "Director Adriana Trigiani, adapting her best-selling novel, delivers the hackneyed material with good cheer, eliciting bright performances from an [excellent] ensemble cast.",
            "The warmth of spirit behind this project allows its missteps to be mostly forgiven.",
            "Apparently too close to the story to recognize how ill suited she was to translating its charms to the screen, Trigiani has emerged with nothing but corny, stilted Americana, like something Garrison Keillor might burp out on a really off day.",
            "Good nature counts for something, but it's all so comfy you may fall asleep.",
            "A novel setting surrenders to a seriously corny rural romance with not nearly enough laughs to put it over. ",

            "Ted 2 is not entirely devoid of comic merit. But it is way off the pace set by its predecessor. ",

            "It's odd to see such a mix of merciless humour and heartfelt schmaltz, but somehow it works in this riotous return to form for MacFarlane.",
            "The filmmakers seem to have put as much effort into the plot as they did with the film's title, relying on terribly low-brow humor to keep things going.",
            "The fate of \"Ted 2\" really boils down to one simple question: Will fans of \"Ted\" and MacFarlane be pleased? Probably.",
            "Even though there's not much new in this installment...it's still fun to go slumming in Ted and John's world-for 115 minutes, at least. ",

            "What makes it work is the solemn efficiency of director David Oelhoffen's storytelling and the quiet intensity of the two leads: The rough tenderness of Mortensen's gaze plays off well against Kateb's conflicted demeanor.",
            "But to expand Camus's slender story to 101 minutes, Oelhoffen decides to say a lot more than the basic dramatic situation necessarily demands.",

            "Surprisingly affecting.",

            "As Westerns go, it is certainly well outside the mainstream, but this small film will linger in the mind longer than most shoot-out standards.",
            "This imbalance in the screenplay keeps Far From Men from its chance at greatness. Nevertheless, its strong stance of taking the side of humanity, even in the face of a civil war in which sides are expected to be taken, deserves respect and applause.",
            "It's a somber-and hopeful-elegy to a time of conflict and one that could draw parallels to many wars, including the one currently raging on between Israel and Palestine.",
            "Viggo Mortensen stars in Far From Men, and he's the main reason to catch it, as he delivers an understated performance of subtle power without ever beating you over the head with it.",
            "A mostly absorbing trek, bolstered by the ominous, enveloping sweep of Guillaume Deffontaines's cinematography and Warren Ellis and Nick Cave's sparse, starkly haunting score.",
            " Speaking fluent French, Viggo Mortensen again proves what a fine actor he is outside of Middle-earth. ",
            "Far From Men astutely highlights that no matter how hard we try, we cannot avoid the tough choices that fate throws our way.",
            "A refined anchoring performance from the famously gymnastic linguist Viggo Mortensen (speaking fluent French and Arabic here) is the trump card played by this stylish production.",
            "Writer/director David Oelhoffen has crafted a soulful, slow-burning western with Far From Men, which is as morally rich as one would expect given its source material, but also considerably more compassionate.",
            "Donning the mantle of a decent man, Viggo Mortensen is remarkable - in part because of the absence of remarkability of his character",
            "Camus sets the movie's initial course, but Mr. Oelhoffen resolutely steers it home with political context, historical hindsight, an unambiguous moral imperative and a pair of well-matched performances; put another way, he makes the story his own.",
            " It's refreshing to see a sincere paean to nobility, honor, and courage, especially one that periodically elevates the pulse with expertly mounted standoffs.",
            "This thoughtful, contemplative Western is compelling and well-crafted, even if it's occasionally as slow as a wandering tumbleweed.",
            "Attempting to expand Camus' rather lean short proves to be a hurdle Oelhoffen can't completely overcome.",
            "The actual physical locations in Far From Men are stunning, and Oelhoffen smartly emphasizes the emptiness of the desert, which seems to stretch on infinitely behind the characters."

            "In the end, the film suffers from cultural overload.",
            "Francofonia is less of a swooning and immersive cinematic experience than a free-range, multi-media essay about the survival of art and culture in an inherently destructive world.",
            "I will not pretend I understood the meaning of every single image I saw, or that I am fully behind Aleksandr Sokurov's views. But I am very happy to have taken this trip through the Louvre, and he sure is an able and knowledgeable guide.",
            "In the grand scheme of things, it's not much, but it's something worth fighting for.",
            "\"More than a documentary, this is a very personal historical essay about the most famous museum in the world\".",
            "More meditative than informative, Francofonia is many things, but it's not your run-of-the-mill documentary. Art and history buffs will get a kick, but perhaps not too many others.",
            "Francofonia (2015) bristles at labeling. The latest whatsit by Russian titan Alexander Sokurov moves comfortably between categories. It stands three paces to the right of the essay film and three paces to the left of the docudrama.",
            "This is one of the best films by the great Russian director Alexander Sokurov.",
            "Enjoy scoping the things you can never quite get a look at because of the stampede of tourists, and mull over Sokurov's sentiment that the contents of the Louvre are worth more than all of France.",
            "While Francofonia has very little to offer on the subject that's new, Sokurov is spry and chatty and keeps things continually engaging.",
            "Sokurov raised any number of fascinating questions and unexpected historical perspectives in this engrossing documentary.",
            "Francofonia is unusual, sometimes challenging, and always intriguing.",
            " Francofonia is beautiful to see, and the big ideas still tug at the heart of viewers and remind contemporary audiences of their place in the world.",
            "Highly recommended for people close to art cinema, avid consumers of World War II stories and above all, for those who enjoy art in general. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Using documentary footage and bits and pieces of semi-realist dramatics, [Sokurov] tells of the strange friendship between the Louvre director Jacques Jaujard and the Nazi officer sent to oversee the treasures and possibly relieve France of them.",
            "An exhilarating intellectual exercise that packs a ludicrous amount of philosophy into 88 dense minutes.",
            "The Russian director Alexander Sokurov has never been afraid of tackling weighty, often philosophical issues head on, and his latest film Francofonia is as pioneering - and, some might say, unnecessarily uncompromising - as ever.",
            "A true conversation with the past, which reminds us that all of what we consider fixed in the canon or forged by history is in place because of specific human personalities and decisions.",
            "Sokurov's thematically chewy if visually choppy film essay on the Louvre's chequered history demands close attention."

            "The great joy of the film, whether you know piano or not, is watching Bernstein teach.",
            "Hawke's cinematic etude may not unlock all the mysteries of music, but \"Seymour: An Introduction\" is universal enough to be understood by a bananafish.",
            "Coming off of his superb one-two performances for Richard Linklater in Before Midnight and Boyhood, Hawke continues to work at a creative high level. He demonstrates a rapport and openness with his subject that proves exceptionally affecting.",
            "Whether or not Hawke got any answers to his questions about the purpose of being artist, seeking them under the guidance of a teacher like Bernstein resulted in this work of art.",
            "Watching Seymour: An Introduction is like receiving a motivational speech from someone who is not just the best at what they do, but also the best person they can possible be.",
            "Gorgeously straightforward yet emotional.",
            "This is classy, dynamic filmmaking that reduced me to tears.",
            "Whether teaching, reviewing new pianos or demonstrating how he plays a specific piece, Bernstein radiates joy and enthusiasm.[Full review in Spanish]",
            "Gossip isn't what [director Ethan] Hawke is after. No, what he's after is no less than the secret of a happy, satisfying artistic life - heck, of a happy, satisfying life in general - and the delightful Bernstein seems to have figured it out.",
            "Academy Award or not, Hawke and Bernstein make a better case than Chazelle and J.K. Simmons.",
            "Whether or not you've studied piano, or any musical instrument, it is fascinating to observe Bernstein's gentle but rigourous technique in correcting errors, training the musicians' bodies, and helping them to locate their own place within the piece.",
            "With this film, [Ethan] Hawke has given the world the gift of being taught to see the world - and music - as [Seymour] Bernstein does, and it's a great one.",
            "Seymour is intriguing, mainly because it brings together two uniquely talented artists -- Hawke and Bernstein -- and captures them in thought and ocasionally in conversation, sometimes together but more often on their own.",
            "More crucial to [the film] than Bernstein's personality, endearing as it is, is the music he plays.",
            "It's quiet, considered and spellbinding, with a great deal of beautiful music - some of it performed exquisitely by Bernstein himself.",
            "Bernstein seems like a man who has found fulfillment in his life, and his students seem fulfilled as well. His story is compelling and his words seem to be loaded with wisdom. He is a fascinating character.",
            "A lovely, purposefully small movie that just dusts the edges of many deep concerns that Bernstein, now in his mid-80s, is still wrestling with. ",
            "It's a poetic statement, but the reason the music and the man stick with us is because they inspire us to work harder at whatever we are doing, regardless of whether it can be played on a piano.",
            "...a gentle yet insistent interrogation of a monkish master, an 88-year-old piano teacher named Seymour Bernstein who, in the grip of terrible stage fright compounded by existential dread, gave up a promising concert career ... ",
            "An idiosyncratic, very personal portrait of an inspiring musical sensibility.",
            "Remarkably elegant film from Ethan Hawke about his friend, classical pianist and sometime-composer Seymour Bernstein, is one of early delights of 2015.",
            "Expertly directed by Ethan Hawke, Seymour: An Introduction is both a portrait of an artist's life and a quiet repudiation of the assumptions that might tempt some people to call Bernstein a failure."

            "The burden rests on Eid's shoulders, and he more than carries it. He's a natural, showing us Theeb's curiosity, loyalty and ingenuity while still retaining the innocence of a boy who has been sheltered from the world outside the desert.",
            "First-time director Naji Abu Nowar rehearsed his largely nonprofessional cast for almost a year before shooting began, and as the title character, Jacir Eid beautifully conveys a mix of emotions, from wonder to fear to determination.",
            "The further this strikingly assured debut feature by the British-born director Naji Abu Nowar goes along, the more it seems a metaphor for fierce self-determination - an origin story for Middle Eastern discontents.",
            "Viewed from the perspective of this young Bedouin, Theeb presages both the treacherous partitioning of Arab lands at the end of the Great War, as well as all the terrible echoes of the colonialism that continue to plague us today.",

            "The epic and the intimate combine impressively in Jordanian director Naji Abu Nowar's debut feature Theeb.",
            "Part of what makes Theeb such a breath of fresh air is that it narrows its focus, examining a group of individuals (and one in particular) rather than getting stuck in well-meaning liberal \"typicality.\" ",

            "The first movie from Jordan to be nominated for a foreign-language Oscar, Theeb is a stark and affecting drama about a boy growing up fast in the face of war.",
            "Nowar operates with the understanding that less is more, and proves that you can make a strong film without dumb contrivances such as exposition and cliched character arcs.",

            "Whatever the state of your mental health, you'll want to follow Alice down the rabbit hole.",

            "The end ultimately justifies the means; whether viewers will want to stick it out is another thing. ",
            "Like its titular Guatemalan volcano, Jayro Bustamante's hypnotic film debut Ixcanul bubbles with the tension of a teenage girl at odds with her family's native customs, before erupting into a frantic and quietly devastating third act.",
            "Whether we're closely gazing at Maria or watching her stride along the ashy volcano's side from a distance, Bustamante lets images linger long enough for their beauty to fall away, giving us a compelling and tragic look at where our coffee comes from.",
            "It all looks fascinatingly foreign to American eyes, but Mar\u00eda's story - about rebellion and consequences, oppression and heartbreak - is anything but.",
            "You can sense the director's respect for his subject in the movie's unhurried dramatic rhythms, its grounding in the earthy rituals of everyday life and its strong cast of nonprofessional Maya actors.",
            "The young woman, whose coming-of-age story this is, responds limply to every force she comes in contact with.",
            "The film is comfortably languid.",

            "The greatest success of Ixcanul, about a Maya woman living in the Guatemalan mountains, is that it makes you feel as though you have come to deeply understand a culture that is so deeply unfamiliar to us ",
            "It often feels like there are a few different movies going on within Ixcanul at the same time, but they're all well constructed enough to make it come together as a mostly cohesive whole.",
            "Ixcanul eludes the kind of drama that ceremoniously, if all too inevitably, attends the bucolic strands of narrative suggested by Bustamante's chosen milieu, instead opting for a more earthy but no less exigent denouement.",
            "Beautifully shot with local residents represented in the cast, the story gains momentum and tragic dimensions as it progresses.",
            "Director Jayro Bustamante erupts onto the scene and brings forth the Guatemalan film Ixcanul (from the Mayan word for volcano), which he delivers with graceful intimacy and a quiet force that builds and builds.",
            "The feature debut of Guatemalan filmmaker Jayro Bustamante is a beautiful and unsentimental portrait of traditional Mayan culture where peasants live in huts without electricity or running water ...",
            "An age-old story is played out among the cinders.",
            "Bustamante never lets the story mechanics overwhelm the basic minute-to-minute reality of his subjects, resulting in a film that's earthy and unsentimental and riveting throughout.",
            "There's nothing glaringly wrong with Ixcanul, it's just hard to get whipped up for stoicism.",
            "The ideal village-picture fable, as fascinating for its innate mythology as for its ethnography.",
            "While storytelling speed seems unbearable in the opening scenes, a rhythm emerges that identifies thrilling directorial control and an appreciation for the brutality of love and trust.",
            "Ixcanul is a moving portrait of a clash of cultures we North Americans may never experience firsthand. ",
            "As an indictment of how people of privilege continue to exploit and abuse life's have-nots, the movie is devastating.",
            "Touching on multiple feminist issues as it goes, and even venturing, gallingly, into the matter of baby trafficking, Ixcanul can suffer from predictability... But the film's rhythms, details and visuals, particularly that volcano, are vivid and unique.",
            "\"Ixcanul\" provides a window into a culture that we rarely see. But it's not just an anthropological study - it has a powerful story to tell, too."

            "is a sharply observed psychological drama that takes time to focus on small, but not insignificant, moments of high emotion",
            "It's an archetypal Canadian story, the kind Canadians have been filming since the corpse fell out of the coffin in Mon Oncle Antoine, but told through a German lens, it looks entirely different.",
            "The cast is largely inanimate in this two-hour slog through rural Canada.",
            "Tomas and Kate's paths will cross repeatedly over the ensuing years, but this is not the story of an unlikely couple drawn together by tragedy. Rather, it is a multi-pronged exploration of the things we keep inside.",
            "Wim Wenders' newest drama proves that 3D doesn't have to be reserved for animated adventures and superhero stories. You can tell a basic drama quite nicely in the third dimension.",
            "A strong cast can't enliven this muddled and lumbering melodrama.",

            "Whedon delivers an uneven, if entertaining second installment that, like many superheroes, has both great strengths and hidden weaknesses.",
            "Another thing people only do to comic book movies is compare them to each other. Nobody walks out of a drama like Boyhood and says \"Now rank all the dramas.\" Age of Ultron is fun, ephemeral summer fare. As lame-o Hawkeye says in the film \"that's our job.\"",
            "It was almost inevitable that the Marvel Cinematic Universe would one day bite off more than it can chew. "

            "Gibney is never able to join, or understand, the choir of millions singing the praises of Steve Jobs. Perhaps because of this, the documentary he has created seems a lot closer to the truth than anything else I've seen about Jobs.",
            "A chilling portrait of an icon who remains revered for spearheading so many technological innovations despite his general contempt for humanity and his utter lack of people skills. ",

            "Thought-provoking documentary on the iconic legendary Apple co-founder.",
            "This isn't a love letter or a takedown; it's a procedural, just-the-facts biography of a man who made a big impact on the world.",
            "The picture is made with the consummate skill of the predominant documentarian of our age, getting as close as conceivably possible to the essence of Jobs.",
            "If GIbney's questions are not precisely yours, his premise - that documentaries must ask questions rather than presume answers - is bracing, reimagining not only what documentaries can do, but also what belief can do.",
            "A thought-provoking and ethically-charged documentary about the Apple computer entrepreneur.",
            "It simply isn't that easy to write off the Jobs' extraordinary drive to succeed at all costs. The difference between Gibney's documentary and other posthumous profiles of Jobs is that it doesn't necessarily maintain a reverential tone toward its subject.",
            "Coolly performs vivisection on a man, a company, an industry, and a way of life.",
            "An attempt to understand the cult around a figure that's virtuous and revolting at the same time. [Full review in Spanish]",
            " While too long and with little new light on Jobs' failings as a human being, the questions it raises about his cult status and the way he helped change the world make it worthwhile.",
            "Alex Gibney's twisty, engrossing documentary Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine approaches its subject from an oblique but highly productive angle.",
            "Steve Jobs: The Man In The Machine is a conversation starter loaded with controversial data about the lesser-known life of genius/tyrant Steve Jobs, but it asks a simple question of \"why\" that it can't even answer itself."

            "Heart of a Dog is a triumph and not simply in its love and candor, but in its calming ease that gently reminds viewers: no matter what, everything will be OK.",

            "Its own great, singular achievement, outside of the considerable iconography. ",
            "with Creed, the series really has returned to its roots... there's an earthiness and street quality that we haven't witnessed since the 1976 original.",
            "Creed is a sure-fire hit that's impossible to hate but I may have to punch the next person who tells me it made them cry.",
            "With all of the redundancies in plot and imagery, it might as well have been one long montage of scenes pulled from the previous six pictures.",
            "Creed hits hardest thanks to a never-better Stallone. Some actors get better with age. Others fade into the distance, taken over by younger talents never to be found again...",
            "There's an incredible empowerment in Creed that speaks volumes to our current generation. With Stallone representing the past, he passes on the boxing and life metaphor torch to Michael B. Jordan which he seizes with open arms.",
            "Although the narrative follows the basic pattern of the previous films, Coogler and Jordan infuse it with an identity all its own. There's a level of grit that hasn't been seen since the original.",

            "Creed is a meditation on fatherlessness, a call-to-arms for black youth who are taught lowered expectations to believe they are powerful, a rousing boxing flick, a quality love story, and one of the best damn films of the year.",
            "What's disappointing about Creed is how slavishly it follows the template of the previous pictures. It's not bad -- it's the best entry since Rocky III -- but one's enjoyment depends entirely on how charitable one is feeling in the nostalgia department.",
            "Director Ryan Coogler gives the film a surprisingly indy feel for such a mainstream franchise.",
            "Ryan Coogler, an accomplished talent after just two films, wisely trades in the authenticity of 'televising' Creed's bouts, a platitudinous technique used so ubiquitously in boxing movies, for intimate handycam..."

            "The film is right in line with Kempner's other works...but as long as she keeps excavating these illuminating treasures of the Jewish-American past, that she's not doing anything radically new fades in importance.",
            "Inspiring as the story of Julius Rosenwald is, there's little in the film that illuminates what kind of man this heroic philanthropist was.",

            "Rosenwald does veer into hagiography, and there's a sense his darker moments are glossed over, but the good works he did should be celebrated, and they're all the more meaningful now that the Voting Rights Act is under attack.",
            "Rosenwald will reaffirm your faith in capitalism, compassion, community, diversity, social justice and the American dream.",
            "Kempner has also interviewed people whose lives were shaped by Rosenwald's charity, and their cultural reminiscences give a strong feeling for what he was all about.",
            "If her film borders on hagiography, Kempner can be forgiven, for this was a remarkable man.",
            "More than awe, the film provokes gratitude for what this man did.",
            "...focusing on a more obscure character for many of us, Kempner's tone remains light, brisk, entertaining, instructive, and thoughtful.",
            "Kempner's film shows the difference one person can make by telling Rosenwald's story, a critical history lesson and a welcome reminder of our own tikkun olam obligations.",
            "\"Rosenwald\" used to be a name to conjure with, but no more, and that is a shame this vivid, engaging documentary attempts to do something about.",
            "Like her subject, Kempner's film doesn't try to be flashy or stylish.",

            "Chooses not to criticize or pass along judgment to Gerry, but rather showcase his extreme sadness and internal pain, which is something that Ben Mendelsohn superbly illustrates with subtle facial expressions",
            "Mississippi Grind not only refuses to indulge in the easy pleasures of dramatic momentum, but it pushes its luck by meandering towards a bizarrely extended series of possible endings.",
            "Reynolds and Mendelsohn are both excellent in an intelligent and richly atmospheric film that deals as much with addiction and human frailty as it does with friendship.",
            "While there is a loose story/plot line to the narrative, Boden and Fleck have crafted the perfect interlude to encapsulate a never-ending story with little hope or light.",

            "It doesn't always add up to much more than a smile and a tear, but the music and the acting are just good enough to make this \"Song\" sing. ",
            "Kate Barker-Froyland's musical melodrama isn't particularly deep in the dramatic department, but hits a few key notes when it comes to its music.",

            "Yet another film about how superior we are to those awful racists from the 19th-century.",
            "Aferim! is the opposite of a cultural celebration. It uses startling, hilarious misanthropy to portray Eastern Europe's immoral legacy - a hapless, dissolute, pusillanimous culture that has bequeathed the region a cynical present.",
            "Although he's taking on a complex historical time...Radu Jude has made a very entertaining film...Marius Panduru, shooting long takes in b&w 35mm, achieves the illusion of a mittel-European Western rediscovered decades after its release.",
            "Jude keeps his camera at judicious distance, but its grit sets it apart from the stern minimalism of most contemporary Romanian filmmaking. ",
            "A boisterous black-and-white Romanian faux-western should not, by rights, be this funny, this jaw-droppingly well photographed, or this incisive in its depiction of society and history.",
            "A twisted history lesson whose messages transcend its insular time period of 19th-century Romania.",
            "Aferim! is a landscape film of gorgeous variety, which sends Costandin and Ionita riding through mountains, fields, and forests, and a folkloric romp of increasingly grisly tone.",
            "So intricately textured, well observed and meticulously researched are the incidents these two encounter... that the film seems to combine the best pleasures of historical romp, road movie and western. ",
            "Everybody in Aferim! seems to hate and demean everyone else. And yet, they all seem like parts of the same blend of cultures - not a melting pot, but sort of a stew - that reasserts itself throughout the film.",
            "The antithesis of warm and reassuring, hard to snuggle up to, but impossible to take our eyes off of.",
            "Both a stark, widescreen black-and-white Western and a deadpan Romanian dramedy in the manner of 'The Death of Mr. Lazarescu' and the recently released 'The Treasure.'",
            "Aferim! never tries to foreground its own significance and is ultimately much more affecting.",
            "Jude gets strong performances from his three leads and, with the help of cinematographer Marius Panduru, has created an uncommonly beautiful film ... that at times evokes the simple beauties of classic Westerns.",
            "In subject and style, it's a departure from [Jude's] contemporary satires, but the period story is evidence of the same keen eye for class hierarchy, codified cruelty and the limits of self-deception.",
            "Like many films set in contemporary Bucharest, this is a story of self-styled potentates, small-time graft, and inevitable disappointment.",
            "Violent, profane, and frequently hilarious.",
            "A funny and brutal costume drama with a potent contemporary kick."

            "There are few titles and no interviews or narration. Entire scenes go by without anyone speaking. Instead, Ballet 422 is a very intimate look at the process.",
            "For fans of dance, \"Ballet 422\" will produce plenty of pleasures. But as with great ballet, great movies always benefit from a little drama.",
            "What makes Jody Lee Lipes documentary so interesting - even transfixing at times - is the fact that nothing is editorialized or explained. There are no interviews or voice-overs.",
            "Director Jody Lee Lipes, known for his cinematography on films like Martha Marcy May Marlene and Tiny Furniture, puts his focus on the long, grueling process of bringing something creative to life in Ballet 422.",

            "Essential viewing for dance fanatics, and perhaps less so for cinephiles. But anyone with even a minor interest in dance or any creative process will learn something about the hard work of the creative process from the film's modest observation.",
            "With its brisk pace and unique style, Ballet 422 is a cinematic gem that encapsulates the passion of two inspired artists, the one in front of the camera and the one behind it.",
            "I have zero interest in ballet, but this film held my interest. It isn't so much about ballet itself, as much as it is about all the people involved in creating and presenting a ballet, and how they all work together so effectively.",
            "In this beautifully muted documentary by cinematographer-director Jody Lee Lipes, a New York City Ballet company dancer gets and takes a chance to create his own show.",
            "Since dance is so difficult to describe, there are some great expressions. My favourite is when Justin tells a performer a sequence is \"not crispy enough.\" Thing is, you get what he means.",

            "Watching the documentary Ballet 422 is like standing in front of a Picasso without knowing anything about the artist, the subject or the context. The work is beautiful but a little more knowledge would bring a lot more depth to what is being viewed.",
            "Ballet 422 lacks the traditional hallmarks of most standard documentary films, eschewing talking head interviews and recurring streams of title cards crafted to hand-hold the audience through learning, and that's what makes it such a gem.",
            "There are very few truly unguarded moments in \"Ballet 422,\" despite its v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style, but it remains a fascinating pullback of a rarely penetrated curtain.",
            "Lipes' verite camera work is first rate, but his abilities as a storyteller are virtually non-existent.",
            "...viewing this film is like being a privileged fly on the wall who has been given access to the working processes of one of the world's greatest ballet companies. ",

            "At its core, \"Ballet 422\" addresses a universal theme: The importance of having a dream, and the courage and dedication to make it come true.",
            "Aside from the time constraint, there isn't much tension here, or much insight into the creative process.",
            "...offers many insights into what goes on behind the scenes, but it presents an environment with minimal conflict and a ballet seen in sketches."

            "It is a very cunning spy thriller that follows the path of Spielberg's historical films. [Full review in Spanish]",

            "Based on the 2010 book by Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway, the film lays out a convincing, follow-the-money trail from the tobacco industry's postwar efforts to prevent (or forestall) government regulation to a profitable lobbying specialty today.",

            "Movies have already been made about the science of climate change, from \"An Inconvenient Truth\" to \"Chasing Ice.\" Robert Kenner (\"Food Inc.\") has made a movie about the anti-science.",
            "The film finds a wealth of worthy interviewees but it probably will preach to the choir on the one hand and be ignored by the other."

            "When you have such a provocative foundation and such rich material to work with, pushing it to the next level isn't necessarily the best choice.",
            "\"Experimenter's\" most striking quality is the way it encourages us to think deeply, from the first frame to the last, even if it's just to consider what on Earth an elephant is doing on screen.",
            "What writer/director Michael Almereyda manages to create with Experimenter is an interesting look at the way Milgram's experiments worked through the eyes of cinema.",
            "A perfect blend of performance art, cinema and the science of psychology, the result is thought-provoking, profound, and beyond intelligently entertaining.",
            "Almereyda's direction is nothing short of brilliant here in the way it channels the spirit of Milgram into its own conception.",
            "Bland and monotonous, Experimenter is certainly a forgettable film.",
            "It's a strange, unsettling, but almost playful experience watching Sarsgaard watch us. It's this mischievousness that makes the film, one of the more unique, oddly entertaining things you'll find at the cinema this fall.",
            "The film works better when crafting its own experiments in social embarrassment, such as the scene where Milgram argues about his work with an Abe Lincoln impersonator, as opposed to the stuffy book report that dominates the final hour.",
            "A fascinating, provocative film about movies and illusion.",
            "Experimenter jumps from one style to another so much we don't know what world it's really set in.",
            "A traditional biopic about Milgram played by a perfect Peter Sarsgaard, between melancholy and boredom. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Experimenter is not only an inventive exploration of the life and personality of an offbeat and perhaps misunderstood intellectual; it is also an exposition of his relentlessly probing mind and jarring revelations.",

            "It is rather encouraging to see a film as ambitiously cerebral as Experimenter let loose in theaters.",

            "Alas, the storytelling remains one-dimensional.",

            "While not for everyone, this old-fashioned adventure with a fresh twist may gain a cult following of those interested in how two French directors challenge the cookie-cutter narrative of most animations.",

            "Gagnol's thin screenplay gives the animation little to latch onto, and the whole enterprise fades into nothingness.",
            "The movie is simple, small and exudes a certain throwback charm.",
            "Kids won't be bothered by the throwback stuff, and most grownups will enjoy the lovingly crafted images of a mythical city at night.",
            "Much is left unsaid in this gentle children's fable, mostly because the filmmakers assume kids are smart enough to read between the lines.",
            "Like their previous entry A Cat in Paris, film soars on wings of directors' film noir fancy with a villain worthy of Fritz Lang. Music by Serge Besset is gigantic asset."

            "A worthy port-of-call for those curious about one of cinema's greatest ever icons - Ingrid Bergman",
            "The picture that emerges is of an emotional nomad with a fragile gift for joy, embodied in a smile that could bring down the walls of Jericho.",
            "In the end, she had no regrets, which may be the most remarkable thing about this remarkable woman.",
            "The woman may now seem less of an enigma. What made her work great remains a mystery.",
            "Those reels are one of the many elements, along with the testimony of her children, several professional collaborators, and extensive archival footage that form this intimate and enlightening documentary",
            "The portrait that emerges is that of a mercurial talent who would not be pinned down, even by a film as adulatory as this one.",
            "This isn't the usual cine-doc that relies heavily on movie clips -- instead, the screen scenes are more like a couple of minutes from Autumn Sonata, a few seconds from Casablanca, a solitary still from Spellbound.",
            "The best thing I can say about it is that I will never see Bergman-someone who I had thought was quite familiar at this point-the same way again.",
            "Such sources and archive footage (much taken by Bergman on her trusty 16mm) lend this portrait valuable authenticity.",
            "Bjorkman makes solid use of the family archive to focus on the Swedish star's personal travails, while Alicia Vikander reads poignantly from her letters and diaries.",
            "A charming, poignant film with a lovely score from Michael Nyman.",
            "A startlingly intimate portrait of a remarkable woman.",
            "Bergman's effortlessly poetic diary and letters provide more evidence, though patently unnecessary, of her artistic temperament, her lyrical view of experience. [Criterion Blu-ray]",
            "Fans will delight in the treasure trove of 16mm footage, photographs, and a wealth of anecdotal testimony from family and peers.",
            "The tone remains meticulously respectful as Bj\u00f6rkman delivers a discerning appraisal of an endlessly intriguing, frequently contradictory individual.",
            "An intimate, if unanalytical, portrait of one of movies greatest talents, told in her own words and through an adroitly assembled use of fantastic home movie footage.",
            "The film is riveting when it delves into the complex family dynamics, but it could have used some tightening."

            "Nominated for the Sundance Grand Jury Prize, the film has plenty of smart, witty lines, and Clement is the perfect actor to give them life.",
            "Clement's predilection for center stage is real and actually kind of astounding, pole-vaulting James Strouse's low-key romantic comedy into something much sturdier.",
            "Strouse has a built a career on small, personal stories, and this film is no different.",
            "Clement is better-suited as a foil to Conchord-like absurdity, where it works as a droll counterweight.",

            "Solomon's skills as a raconteur, the employees' unabashed love for their work, and the constant stream of rock music playing in the background advance the film into something much more than a talking-heads documentary.",
            "In Colin Hanks' admiring and tragic corporate biography, Tower Records wasn't just a rock 'n' roll mecca, but a family operation that got high on its own supply.",
            "Hanks and Leckart tap into a latent nostalgia for Tower's free-and-easy heyday, and the movie is an intensely bittersweet experience for anyone who grew up with Tower Records as a home away from home.",

            "But Hanks wisely limits the celebrity talking heads in this rise-and-fall story. Instead, he focuses on the people who built the company from a Sacramento drugstore annex to a global brand, creating a ragtag family in the process.",
            "While it's hard to shed too many tears over a corporation taking its customers for granted, what Hanks' movie does so well is appreciate the people who built Tower, and in doing so, transmit that in this case, they did care."

            "In the Shadow of Women is a trifle: pretty, but lacking any substance.",
            "In the Shadow of Women is one of Garrel's weakest works. (It) feels dated, as if it is grasping to be relevant in world that the director perhaps no longer inhabits.",
            "Merhar emotes so little than his bodily tremble during a climactic argument with his wife is seismic. Courau, on the other hand, frowns, dotes, laughs, and seems entirely human.",
            "Shot in diffused black and white ... the movie teeters on the edge of self-parody. Two heated performances, sexy and vicious, anchor it in the artful.",
            "In Philippe Garrel's finely wrought In the Shadow of Women ... the struggles of the creative class are repeatedly contrasted with the weight of 20th-century French history.",
            "It's more dialogue than action, but the film's emotional conversations hit home-especially the brutally honest scenes in which the couple lie together after sex and both know that the love is gone.",
            "Garrel's exceptional achievement is managing to treat such potentially trite material with a freshness that is discreetly radical.",
            "Sweet shimmering sliver of romantic regret... he demonstrates through jealousy that you only ruin yourself... a behavioral lightness that's like hypnosis for both the characters and a ready audience. ",

            "A French drama that reveals the pain and confusion of those whose marriages have been rocked by infidelity",
            "Mr. Garrel is always worth attending to when he takes up the rhythms and paradoxes of love, and even though this is a minor entry in his canon of melancholy romances, it is brief, brisk and intermittently affecting.",
            "What distinguishes In the Shadow of Women are its naturalistic performances - especially Courau's - and its elegantly composed shots and offhand rhythm.",
            "Perhaps, having made so many movies that feel like ghost stories, Garrel deserves to take it easy for once.",
            "The sturdy elements of '60s-era French romantic drama -- crummy (yet charming) apartments, horrible breakup scenes and a relaxed sense of time -- come together in this beautifully realized black-and-white throwback."

            "It may not qualify as a movie entertainment in the full sense of the word, but it is most certainly an edifying picture of social stagnation at its saddest.",

            "While not an outright disaster, this is still as massively perplexing a misfire as any likely to see a release this year.",
            "ny picture featuring Geoffrey Rush channelling King Lear as the patriarch god Ra while flying about in a spaceship can't be all bad.",
            "The fantasy film Gods of Egypt does practically everything wrong, from its whitewashed cast to its irredeemably goofy storyline. What a waste.",
            "A raspy voiceover man (Lindsay Farris) announces authoratively that we are about to witness the story of the Egyptian gods... \"From what I recall it goes something like this.\" What? Did he just say that?",
            "Unprecedentedly violent and incomparably preposterous.",
            "The film doesn't just play fast and loose with mythology, it also besmirches the cinematic legacy that precedes it - chiefly, the inventive ancient Greek special effects creations of Ray Harryhausen.",
            "We had very high expectations for it but then it awfully disappointed.",
            "This is a badly rendered CGI wasteland that has no sense of fun or adventure, and wallows in its own mediocrity.",
            "Gods of Egypt is the latest in a long line of insane, half-assed fantasy epics that leave audiences scratching their heads, jaws agape, wondering what the they just witnessed. Half tedious, half the best time I've ever had at the movies.",
            "The posters were ugly, the trailers foreshadowed disaster, and... yes, the movie did not disappoint in being a train wreck. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Not since Jupiter Ascending have I seen such a hot mess, but much more of an entertaining one.",
            "It was the best piece of hot, hot garbage that I've consumed this year.",
            "I felt neither disdain nor schadenfreude during it, only boredom and a slight headache afterwards. ",
            "The gods Horus and Set assume winged form and dogfight with magic fire lasers as Apophis the Giant Worm of Chaos literally drinks the Nile River in the background, and yet it's deathly boring.",
            "GODS OF EGYPT is a movie that commands no respect and lets you sit back and have brainless fun.",
            "Gods of Egypt is likely to strike you down, with overwhelming boredom, an urge to cringe and a profound regret at spending actual money to see this big-budget turkey.",
            "You might say it's deliciously awful.",
            "\"Gods of Egypt\" expresses an intense effort in its cinematography, but is accompanied by disappointing characters that are all brawn and no brain or heart. The characters are forgettable and lack substance, and the dialogue is comically bad. ",
            "While early action sequences show some flair, sadly the film's third act descends into the repetitive meaningless mass destruction we expect from modern blockbusters.",
            "It's an utter failure from director Alex Proyas. ",
            "It's a brutal attempt to recreate the Egyptian folklore, with disastrous results.",
            "They just keep inventing story points...the worst part of this movie, though, is that it's 127 minutes...",
            "The effort it takes to sit through this movie strains the eyes, the intellect, and the attention span.",
            "What ultimately makes Gods of Egypt such an off-the-charts bomb is that it tries to shoehorn Egyptian history and myth into the Biblical epic formula."

            "This documentary holds every card in the pack, from geology to anthropology to the history of tribes and tyrants, and plays them like a master.",
            "This haunting Chilean documentary is more poetry than journalism as filmmaker Patricio Guzman compares the fate of the indigenous people of Patagonia with that of the disappeared of the Pinochet regime.",
            "As always, Guzm\u00e1n unearths details that establish resonant connections between diverse worlds (the \"pearl button\" of the title proves typically allusive) but at a brief 82 minutes this feels like too many streams gathering in one overcrowded pool.",

            "An astoundingly beautiful visual essay which revels in the stunning scenery of Chilean Patagonia, it morphs into a harrowing depiction of the nation's distant and recent past.",
            "Guzm\u00e1n's predilection for na\u00efve wide-eyed wonder weighs down his recent films, never eclipses the most striking feature of his work: the way in which dreamy musings and far-fetched speculations coexist with toughness, prickliness, and matter-of-factness",
            "A fascinating journey through Chile's troubled past.",
            "The most recent documentary by Patricio Guzm\u00e1n explores and faces the past and the presen of Chile, looking at the heavens and turning down, towards the earth. Or, in this case, to the sea. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Chilean documentarian Patricio Guzm\u00e1n delivers a stunning companion piece to his 2010 film Nostalgia For The Light, continuing his exploration of the effects of Augusto Pinochet's ruthless dictatorship.",
            "Time and again, Guzman generates profound meanings from simple concepts.",
            "A film where poetry is everything, with beautiful images and music. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Guzm\u00e1n's generous diagnosis of human failing makes for a truly moving and ingenious film even if it lacks the sharp focus or political edge of his best work.",
            "Fans of Terrence Malick and timeless images of nature and space should catch The Pearl Button, a leisurely but pointed meditation on human history.",
            "It's not a failure by any means, but given the power and elegance with which Guzm\u00e1n usually makes his points, it does seem rather slight.",
            "A challenging film that addresses big issues with grace and humanity.",
            "This is a film of masterly artistry, heaving political anger and uncontained ambition.",
            "A sobering, lyrical essay film on Chile's various physical and emotional surface areas.",
            "Contrasting sea and sand, buttons and stars, Guzm\u00e1n laments Chile's failure to exploit its natural and human resources in this typically astute, potent and beautifully photographed essay.",
            "Despite the striking photography, this fascinating denunciation of 150 years of persecution and oppression lacks Guzm\u00e1n's customary trenchancy and restraint.",
            "If, as the poet Ra\u00fal Zurita testifies, the process of returning the dead is about allowing the living to grieve, The Pearl Button is ultimately about cinema's unique way of retelling the past."

            "The size of that ensemble and Swanberg's particular way of sorta hazily drifting from one half-overheard conversation to the next gives the picture a Robert Altman vibe that's never really been present in his work before.",
            "The movie has been dedicated to Paul Mazursky, the great radiologist of American social interplay who died last year. But Swanberg is still murmuring where Mazursky could speechify, gesticulate, and shout, sometimes in the same sequence.",
            "Conversations drift and weave, as do the people having them. Narcissistic melancholy dukes it out with beer-and-pot-stoked merriment. There is longing. There is foolhardiness.",
            "While you're watching it, \"Digging for Fire\" may feel slight or tentative, but its cumulative impact is entrancing. Few films about a marital rift make so much of what seems so little.",
            "While it has its charms, Swanberg is tilling soil here that has been churned since humanity began, and he doesn't come up with very much that's new.",
            "Digging for Fire fails its title's own promise: It has the capacity for startling insight and artistry, but mostly it's just a toe listlessly pushing dirt around.",
            "The frivolous blend of ludicrous mystery and tepid romance offered in Digging For Fire got me quickly bored.",
            "Simple but affecting, deep without becoming preachy, and dancing on the line between comedy and drama.",
            "What makes Digging for Fire such an enjoyable yet fleeting experience is how Swanberg lets these ideas flow organically into the film through his terrific cast and tight editing.",
            "DIGGING FOR FIRE is the tight, often funny and loosely scripted film that relies on the choices of the actors living in the moment",
            "Digging for Fire is not revolutionary, or even revelatory, but it captures some things that are hard to express, and it did so with a terrific cast. ",
            "Digging for Fire has an absolutely loaded cast full of recognizable names, but does nothing with them;",
            "The actors are fine, but the end result feels undercooked, largely because of all the detours and subplots. It's like a miniseries writ small.",
            "Strong performances drive thoughtful, mature marital drama.",
            "May not say anything revelatory, but the realization it imparts is no less valuable for it.",
            "The looseness turns into haphazardness, and while the picture digs around a lot, it never really catches fire.",
            "It's a killer when 90 percent of your film consists of dozens of actors spouting reams of improvised dialogue that quickly fades into a din. ",
            "The large, talented cast is clearly thriving in the freewheeling style.",
            "Given all the sexed-up tension and enigmatic buzz of a murder mystery, Digging for Fire doesn't ever really get dirty enough.",
            "It's peak mumblecore with some big stars getting in on the action. And it's completely empty.",

            "A great psychodrama about a strange war in a strange land and a skirmish with no winners.",
            "Moviegoers hoping for a more traditional cinematic take on war may be turned off by just how quiet and contemplative Neither Heaven Nor Earth is, but those prepared for a more philosophical take will walk away satisfied.",
            "A French/Belgian metaphysical drama about the mysterious disappearance of soldiers on both sides in the Afghanistan war.",

            "French troops on the front lines in Afghanistan fall prey to an unseen enemy in a strikingly original war story.",
            "The performances are strong, the cinematography by Sylvain Verdet alternately harsh and spooky, and one or two of Cogitore's images are almost good enough to have come from Claire Denis.",
            "A bizarre, cross-genre production that is a war movie, a suspense film, and a metaphysical creation. The viewer will be left with the impression that it's better not to join the military.",
            "As with the soldiers, the direction has a workman-like quality as it goes about its task of exploring the story.",
            "[It] has a highly suggestive philosophical agenda, but at the same time functions as a gripping, subtly eerie drama which keeps you guessing even while it maintains its supernatural (or theological) undertow simmering beneath the surface.",
            "[Cogitore] has a few good ideas and the right elements to set them off, but his bomb doesn't fully detonate.",
            "Shot on digital video and emblazoned with such impressionistic effects as the visions captured by a night-vision camera, Neither Heaven Nor Earth is a contemporary ghost story that's both unabashedly mystical and thrillingly pulpy."

            "She is as invigorated by her missing daughter's sexuality as her husband is terrified. It's an interesting enough subtext, but foregrounded, it's not enough to carry the muddled movie that ensues.",
            "Strangerland runs out of gas, leaving us with a couple of final \"Forget You\" (shall we say) moments. Thanks. Thanks for nothing.",
            "Director Kim Farrant goes for a feeling that's as harsh, unforgiving, and wild as the land she lets the camera linger on, and it's the right idea when handling the potential melodrama of the material.",
            "erie and unpredictable, Strangerland holds attention, even if traditional suspense tricks are avoided like they were dingos at the daycare.",
            "Kidman's best performances have often been as grieving moms (Dead Calm, The Others, Rabbit Hole) and here she provides the flaccid movie's sole flash of daring and unpredictability.",
            "Strangerland amounts to little more than a turgid 2 hours with a pair of bland, lifeless characters. ",
            "It occasionally winds down here and there, but the intrigue and the character interactions keep it from dipping too low. With strong performances throughout and a story that is solidly told, we have a lot to look forward to from Kim Farrant.",
            "The ambiguity that characterizes the film ultimately does not seem to be so much an artistic decision as lack of assertiveness on the part of the writers. The acting saves it.",
            "It's the parched Outback landscape, thrumming with beauty and menace, that leaves the biggest impression.",
            "Secrets and lies is the name of the game, in other words, as this taut but sinister ensemble piece turns the screws in what is an intelligent, all-engrossing - and indeed Irish-produced - film.",
            "A shift in focus from a potentially jittery thriller to a humdrum, psychological analysis of a dislocated family becomes the narrative driving force and given the rich backdrop, it appears a great opportunity has been severely missed. ",
            "All the guilt, shame and anguish create a heady brew in an atmospheric but sometimes overwrought tale of a family in crisis.",
            "While director Kim Farrant superbly captures the haunting, parched beauty of the Aussie interior in her debut feature, she stumbles when it comes to the emotional landscape, with the movie flickering uncertainly in tone.",
            "The result won't astound but it will intrigue - at least for a time.",
            "Strangerland unassumingly goes way beyond your usual art-house fare to the heart of a scared and scary colonised country.",
            "If only the malevolent spirit of the bush were a satisfactory explanation for the enigma being spun here.",
            "The pieces of this troubling puzzle never come together; indeed, it appears that they're not meant to.",
            "Exemplifies why it's hard to sell Australian made films to the public, with potential there to create something intriguing, yet for every step forward it takes three back, a couple to the side and then does the arty-farty boogie.",
            "... the melodrama is overheated more than the sweltering setting.",
            "Strangerland is presented through a prism of womanly wantoness juxtaposed with a mother's pain and fear. ",
            "Despite all of its well-intentioned, high-minded aspirations, Strangerland is a hodgepodge that plods along at a torpid pace.",
            "Drenching the movie in so much mood is rough on the pacing, and there's a pointed lack of urgency to the search.",
            "A slow, opaque Australian psychologicsal drama."

            "A completely weird, off-kilter, bizarro-land version of a romantic comedy, writer/director Andrew Bujalski finally cracks the Broadcast News code moony filmmakers have been trying to break for three decades.",
            "Bujalski might never crack Hollywood, but what does it matter? He's defiantly his own man. Results gets results.",
            "Bujalski's script is smarter and much weirder (in a good way) than the standard romantic comedy. ",
            "A movie like this feels like a dream challenge for an actor. It lives and dies not sheerly by the writing and the direction of the script, but by the cast's organic adherence to both.",

            "A respectable, funny and softy touching grown up take on the endlessly re-hashed rom-com formula.",
            "A romantic comedy is nothing without its leads, and [Cobie] Smulders and [Guy] Pearce make a wonderful, charming pair.",
            "Results is not without nice touches, and will raise a sm ile more than a few times. Guy Pearce's slightly off-kilter performance as philosophy-driven Trevor is worth a look.",
            "A creative comedy about two physical fitness pros and an out-of-shape client who spurs them on to fresh possibilities.",
            "This is one of those romantic comedies with a meandering plot and offbeat characters who don't seem to know what they are doing most of the time. But these wacky, drunk, stoner characters grew on me. They are lovable.",
            "While it has the trappings of a mainstream rom-com, it largely refuses to follow that template.",
            "Realistic romance drama revolving around the incestuous gyrations among gym rats in love, in like and in lust.",
            "An engrossing droll relationship comedy by mumblecore filmmaker Andrew Bujalski.",
            "In truth, it doesn't quite work, but the dissonance between the content and Bujalski's approach is oddly compelling.",
            "Thankfully, Results does not become a straight-ahead tug-of-war. It's a much more subtle and affecting odyssey of the soul, moving in pleasantly unpredictable turns that, while they don't always make logical sense, are palpably driven by the heart.",
            "The movie is a delight start to finish, but it never sells out its characters for each sentiment or laughs: It sees all three of them as damaged, difficult dreamers who need each other so they'll finally start getting out of their own way. ",

            "This cosmopolitan noir thriller sometimes raises more questions than it has answers, just like its characters, but remains a compelling and well-acted murder mystery.",

            "This plays like Law and Order, but there are also striking glimpses of a backward society in rapid transition. ",
            "An affecting drama that is honest and clear-eyed about Hirut's trauma, and the ongoing struggles she'll face even if she's freed, without ever treating her abuse in an exploitative manner.",
            "Mehari's drama about the landmark court case that ended child bride kidnapping in Ethiopia is hardly a sophisticated film. But that can't diminish the importance of its message.",
            "It's not exceptional filmmaking - the characters are particularly thin - but that doesn't make it anything less than necessary viewing.",
            "This film is a necessary reminder of what can happen when people preserve tradition for its own sake.",
            "\"Difret\" has an earnestness that hovers between plain-spoken and pedestrian, and there are scenes and sequences that just don't come together as written and edited, no matter how admirable the film's existence is.",
            "The awkwardness of the overall production evaporates whenever Getnet and Hagere deliver their haunting performances and it makes for a strong debut from a director with important stories to share.",
            " Although the film doesn't dig into its characters' backstories much beyond Meaza, so as not to take away from the film's energetic pace, it treats all of them with respect, no matter how perverse their views may seem. ",
            "Difret is heavy-handed cinema and conflicted advocacy for a cause that deserves better.",
            "Change is complex-[Difret] illustrates that.",
            "It's not always a riveting sit, perhaps too procedural at times, but the effort excels at providing a glimpse of a little-known human rights violation, and one that continues to occur around the world to this day.",
            "Tizita Hagere as Hirut Assefa provides the film with its stark emotional center while the unassuming cinematography emphasizes the feeling that the audience aren't just bystanders, but witnesses.",
            "An earnest and passionate film, based on a true story that is enraging yet inspiring, that is essential viewing for anyone concerned with women's rights.",
            "Difret [feels] more like an on-site documentary than a dramatic film.",
            "Intense Ethiopian film makes case for girls'/women's rights.",
            "The true story of a landmark case about abduction for marriage in Ethiopia that stands up for the dignity and rights of women everywhere.",
            "Difret is painful but profound, skirting the pitfalls of the inspirational biopic for something more grounded and remarkable. Its authenticity extends beyond its central characters, conveying a very real sense of what is at stake.",
            "Difret is concerned with Ethiopian feminism in both method and narrative.",
            "Misogyny, tradition, innocence and experience are among the themes given a sophisticated treatment herein.",
            "Difret is a true story, that dives into the layer of polite social customs to expose a deeply set patriarchal system, which promotes hostile conditions for women in Ethiopia.",
            "The film focuses on the moving and complex relationship between Hirut (Tizita Hagere) and her lawyer Meaza Ashenafi (Meron Getnet) as they battle a death sentence and prejudice against women.",
            "Difret is an important film dealing with an important theme ... Don't be deterred by the gravitas.",
            "While Mehari's motives could not be more honourable, his methods leave much to be desired.",
            "It's hard not to stifle a tear at the emotional climax, and cinematographer Monika Lenczewska does a particularly handsome job evoking the milieu."

            "You may find \"Sunshine Superman\" exhilarating or you may find \"Sunshine Superman\" terrifying, but you almost surely will not find it boring.",
            "Sunshine Superman is at times a bit too reverent with the material, and there are distracting reenactments (\u00e0 la The Jinx and Man on Wire), some of which seem extraneous, but overall, the film is a sun-kissed tribute to a singular individual.",
            "Engrossing, tension-filled and utterly fascinating.",
            "While the doc takes a conventional and even pedestrian approach -- with multiple talking-head interviews and some re-enactments with actors -- there is also plenty of spectacular archival footage showing jumps dating back to the 1960s.",
            "[A] spectacular and affecting portrait.",
            "Long before there were GoPros, there was Boenish, a camera mounted on his helmet, jumping from Yosemite's El Capitan or L.A. skyscrapers under construction.",
            "The footage is spectacular, and the big screen is the perfect place to convey that majesty.",
            "[Director] Marah Strauch captures here not only arresting visuals, she effortlessly sums up emotions, and extremely inspiring ones at that.",
            "Thrilling not just from its subject's charisma and death-defying feats, but from the inventive and terrifying process of filming a jump.",
            "In the end, Jean Boenish is the real hero of Sunshine Superman.",
            "The unabashed freedom and high spirits of the film are almost overshadowed by the brutally sobering ending.",
            "Sunshine Superman is a touch long, and at times pedestrian but it's still a moving, thrilling story.",
            "Ever watched an extreme sports enthusiast leap off a mountain to his death? No? Then you haven't seen this bittersweet biopic about a compulsive base jumper with a death wish. ",
            "This documentary about Carl Boenish, founder of modern BASE jumping is a captivating portrait of a man unlike any other. Not just an adrenaline junkie, but a superb cinematographer, technical wizard, philosopher, filmmaker and promoter of his sport.",
            "This is still a wonderful portrait of a man who chose to embrace life to its fullest whilst biting his thumb at gravity.",
            "Heart-stopping cliff-jumping doc.",
            "It's a routine documentary about a fascinating man, albeit one with a great classic rock soundtrack.",
            "It will dropkick you right in the vertigo.",
            "First-time filmmaker Marah Strauch skillfully interweaves the Boenish story -- full of copious vintage footage shot by Carl -- with dramatizations and interviews.",
            "[Boenish] convinced plenty of jumpers to strap cameras to their heads, which resulted in some spectacular footage.",
            "You might walk away from the film saying not 'That was cool' or 'That was sad,' but: 'That soundtrack was really fantastic.'",
            "Daring, Thrilling, Surprising - a well told true story",
            "The two sides of the documentary more often exist alongside each other, rather than supporting them. Still, especially for people who aren't going to be throwing out chutes any time soon, it's a thrilling ride.",
            "Boenish's enthusiasm and life-force energize Sunshine Superman whenever he's an onscreen presence; his absence proves to be a much harder thing to turn into compelling cinema."

            "Trainwreck is both the best romantic comedy of the year as well as its most crushing disappointment.",
            "At times it feels as if five different films are going on at once, but Schumer's whip-smart delivery and no-holds perkiness keeps it all in place.",
            "An entertaining and emotionally honest film.",
            "Trainwreck is quite raunchy. It's also hilarious and very sweet...I expected the raunchiness and for it to be really funny, but I didn't expect it to have such heart.",

            "So, yes, it's a romantic comedy. You know where it's going. But Trainwreck is one that's smart, witty, and a little bruised. ",
            "For the sections of its 124-minute running time that it focuses on Amy's romantic foibles, Trainwreck is a good time at the movies.",
            "It's sharp, subtle, funny and thoroughly entertaining.",
            "Trainwreck lives and dies with Schumer, but she picked the right director to wring sympathy out of a character who is looking for love, yet may be too damaged to find its restorative powers.",
            "The movie's not perfect, and neither is Amy, but it's a strong step in the right direction.",

            "Five minutes ago, Amy Schumer was an ungovernable force of comedy. Then, she was introduced to Lena Dunham, and possibly Patricia Arquette...",
            "Schumer is a talent Hollywood has understandably fallen in love with; Trainwreck plays fast and lewd, hitting an impressive laugh-rate and bringing a fresh take to a hoary genre.",
            "If Trainwreck ultimately fails to match the remarkable, politically-informed comedic zeniths of Schumer's superb sketch series... [it] still frequently impresses by further acquainting us with the radically refreshing transparency of Amy Schumer, actress.",
            "The classic rom-com formula is represented here without deviation, but the movie works because it's all just a frame for Schumer's personality and charisma, which is rich and colorful enough to carry any plot, even unimaginative ones, to success. ",

            "It wants to immerse itself entirely in Agu's experience, yet the filmmaker can't resist standing aloft in scenes that underscore the soldiers' ages and their actions, and pointing out easy ironies.",
            "Fukunaga gives the film a visual grandeur that makes it feel like it's taking place after the world has ended, and all that's left for Agu is this morass of endless, uncaring violence.",
            "Fukunaga's hurtling camera and taut cutting keep Beasts of No Nation only just this side of hallucinatory, and Elba is the kind of titanic actor to kick it to a near-mythic level.",
            "Under Fukunaga's expert guidance the camerawork nearly becomes a third character alongside the real find in the film, newcomer Abraham Attah as Agu.",
            "It's a powerful tale of lost innocence, albeit sometimes heavy-handed in its depiction of the plight of African child soldiers.",
            "Attah is an industrious little actor, but his fall from innocence is not delineated with the same force as the carnage.",
            "Push it up your watchlist, you won't regret it.",
            "A harrowing, surreal, and often times bleak portrayal of a reality many of us shy away from. ",

            "Beasts of No Nation is high caliber cinema.",
            "It will be seared into viewers' memories for quite some time.",
            "Beasts is a harrowing experience, but a powerful one. It might read as derivative to a cynic, but there's something palpable at the film's core that can't be denied.",
            "The cast's intense young actors are to be applauded, as is the film's stance as a thought-provoking (and crushing) piece of cinema - but twenty minutes fewer would alleviate violence fatigue.",
            "Violent, but not without reason, Fukunaga brings out the best of his actors, his story, and his resources for a movie that will sit heavily in your heart and thoughts long after the credits roll.",
            "Fukunaga and his actors -- especially the two leads -- have managed to create a riveting drama which is suitably appalling.",
            "It's a one-hundred-percent humanistic, visceral story that transcends any issue or conflict you could read about in the news. ",
            "Beasts Of No Nation is a masterful film; assured, confident, artful.",
            "BEASTS OF NO NATION brings the tension, along with the tears through the crippling fear that encompasses the landscape...",
            "Needless to say, but Alba is so damn amazing. For the most part, he was convincing, he was totally committed to that role.",
            "This is a powerhouse of a film about a subject matter most people might not even realize exists to the extent that it does. It's assured and confident with a deeply sympathetic center that carries you to the end.",
            "A tough, but rewarding watch. As this is Netflix's first charge into feature films, they have set a pretty high bar for themselves.",
            "The result is a film that is at once diligently dramatic and oddly becalmed, a film about unutterable horror that isn't particularly horrifying.",
            "Beasts of No Nation is that rare monster of a film that is incredibly difficult to watch, yet impossible to look away from",
            "Beasts as a film is worthy of its terrific lead performances. In case there was any doubt, Fukunaga is a MAJOR talent, and ought to be writing his own ticket from here on out."

            "Gross ... is ultimately unable to satisfy the rules of dramatic engagement.",
            "Viewers are graced with a few disappointingly subdued action scenes, two humdrum romantic subplots, and a virtual museum of bad acting.",
            "Paul Gross situates the film's events somewhere between violent, militaristic fantasy and gentler, anti-war lament.",
            "The war story featuring good people making the best of a bad situation may feel very familiar, but it is a better kind of familiarity that also characterizes Hyena Road.",
            "It's enjoyable enough on first watch, but it's unlikely you'll want to see it again. ",
            "Gross manages to craft a feature that's horrifying and strangely inviting at the same time, delivering solid characterization to go with all the chaos. ",
            "The explosions are so wonderfully photographed; if only we actually cared about the characters exploding.",
            "While it's not American Sniper, it still seems like a missed opportunity.",

            "Canada's own war-on-terror film can't get beyond embedding us among the troops (GoPro-style shots, military code and jargon) to strike at any deep, dark truths about the recent war in Afghanistan.",
            "The strategy was sound, but the script proves clunky on screen because it's clad in a heavy armor of thought and doesn't leave enough gaps for the subtle nuances and offhand gestures that make characters feel entirely real.",
            "Gross' combat scenes are the appropriate kind of chaotic, explosive rushes that tend to feature the soldiers trying to figure what's going on as much as actually fighting.",
            "The goal of the movie is truth-telling rather than flag-waving, but it also succeeds as impactful storytelling.",
            "\"Hyena Road\" has an agreeable modesty to it that almost makes up for what can sometimes be a very pedestrian treatment of contemporary warfare.",
            "Gross' script realistically depicts the uncertain and frequently shifting alliances that characterized the Afghan conflict's security situation.",
            "The conflict between acting strategically from the comfort of a military base, and acting morally on the ground, plays well in Hyena Road.",
            "The film acknowledges political and moral quandaries in Canada's peacekeeping mission in Afghanistan but then applies the most disingenuous tropes from old-school combat films and westerns to gloss over the grey areas.",
            "Writer-director-star Paul Gross spent a lot of time over in Afghanistan as he prepared to make Hyena Road, and the verisimilitude of its combat sequences, both on the ground and back at command centre, is one of the payoffs.",
            "An engrossing rebuttal to the sense that only Hollywood can do big, kinetic entertainment.",
            "Alternately detailed and derivative, thesp-filmmaker Paul Gross' third feature has a relatively offbeat point of view that only partially masks its formulaic characters and narrative twists."

            "Handsomely shot by Damian Garcia in full-frame black-and-white, G\u00fceros is at times both painfully arty and arbitrarily plotted.",

            "Cinematographer Christos Karamanis boxes in the madness with disciplined framing. It is, perhaps entirely the point, that the film's shenanigans leave one yearning for the same sense of order to be imposed elsewhere.",
            "Tsangari's deadpan approach to the increasingly sociopathic behaviour of the sextet is perfectly judged.",
            "It is very well-acted, and often chuckle-worthy, and it does pose an amusingly distant view at how we all constantly compete with one another anyway, whether we're using a rulebook or not. ",
            "Tsangari leaves plenty of room for interpretation in terms of figuring out what exactly this absurdist case of male competition can represent, but some moments point toward a fun case of role reversal between genders. ",
            "[Tsangari] has made Chevalier into a raffish and intelligent divertissement with one of the year's most applaudably in-sync ensembles. ",
            "Tsangari seems less interested in satire than in digressive dawdling, and while she probably achieved exactly the sterile tone that she wanted, a lot of Chevalier plays like Kubrick on horse tranquilizers, empty and benumbed.",
            "Athina Rachel Tsangari's Chevalier is a timely arrival as it zeroes in on the minutiae that constructs the modern male identity.",
            "Chevalier may, as well as a sideswipe at male ego and rivalry, be a wider sideways comment on the prevailing political situation in Greece, where everyone, even the two hired staff, gets drawn into the game.",

            "Athina Rachel Tsangari, who reenergized contemporary Greek cinema with Lanthimos, succeeds in Chevalier by concentrating on a group of six men.",
            "Chevalier is rich with bickering and petty squabbles, but the film is sustained thanks to the men's ability to preserve (for the most part) a modicum of respect toward one another, and toward the rules of their absurd game. ",
            "... there's another benefit to a greater percentage of female directors: a more critical take on masculinity.",

            "With his feature debut, young Australian filmmaker Ariel Kleiman tells a creepy story about a cult-like commune, anchored by a riveting performance from French actor Vincent Cassel. ",
            "Kleiman's Dogtooth-esque dark drama paints a weird and disturbing portrait of stolen innocence.",
            "Cassel's subtle and quietly menacing performance helps compensate for a story that drifts along rather aimlessly at times, while Kleiman's dreamy visuals mark him out as a talent to watch.",
            "Partisan is an impressive feature debut; both expertly condemning its paternalistic society, but sadly lacking in a single interesting female character to take a stand to Cassel's complex figure.",
            "A deeply frustrating head-scratcher.",
            "Vincent Cassel's primal physicality and threatening charm are front and center in this taut dystopian fable."

            "The end result is a revealing portrait of an artist wholly dedicated to his art.",
            "\"Noma: My Perfect Storm\" is crafted with exquisite care in the vein of its subject, though it occasionally feels overly precious.",
            "Less a documentary than a glittering souvenir, but it's still a record of a legend.",
            "Most scenes feel stagey, with Redzepi feigning intimacy but sounding like he's auditioning to be the next Gordon Ramsay. ",
            "Noma: My Perfect Storm doesn't reflect in its form chef Redzepi's obsession with food, which in this case turns out to be a fatal flaw. The film is too fixated on what's in his head to truly appreciate what he's making with his hands.",
            "The film's cinematography does its best to capture the beauty of Redzepi's dishes. The images are so stunning, it's hard to believe they are objects you put in your mouth and destroy. ",
            "Combining fly-on-the-wall observations, talking heads and artistic cutaways, there is enough for everyone's tastes.",
            "Foremost in this fly-on-the-wall report is the fascinating contradiction of Redzepi himself, whose abrasive perfectionism appears to be prompted by the prejudice he suffered in his youth after his family moved to Denmark from humble roots in Macedonia.",
            "Redzepi's creations explode with color and are highly imaginative. His dishes seem less like food and more like a series of art installations.",
            "Any attempt to examine Redzepi's philosophy, much less interrogate the reasons for the restaurant's success (is it more than a fad or a gimmick?), is notably missing in action. In its place are pretty pictures of glistening leaves.",
            "Unfortunately, you learn more about his struggles, and his food, in multiple episodes of Anthony Bourdain's TV series No Reservations and The Mind of a Chef than you do in the 100 mostly flaccid minutes of Noma: My Perfect Storm. ",
            "Food is not an inherently cinematic subject, being fundamentally about the sense of taste rather than that of sight. But, in its own terms, this doco isn't too bad at all.",
            "The film forgoes narration for a naturalistic style, putting viewers in the place they're most curious about -- the kitchen.",
            "Despite some mouth-watering shots of the presumably delicious menu items, the approach combines a strange mix of ingredients that isn't for all tastes.",

            "The problem is that LaMattina and Walker refuse to let Spinney's story breathe for a single moment, instead relying on a barrage of maudlin tactics to choke tears out of viewers. ",
            "I Am Big Bird: The Caroll Spinney Story\" is the delightful and heartwarming story of the man inside the head, the 8 foot tall 6 year old who has crossed borders, transcended politics, breached intractable boundaries and enriched lives from his inception.",
            "A slathering of sentimentally triumphant music emphasizes what seems like a feeling of protectiveness for their subject, but fair enough.",
            "It plays like an extended promo, washed with a score of elevator-music strings, and composed of so many talking-head snatches that it often feels like a trailer for itself.",
            "It's amazing that a documentary so clumsy has such incredible highs and lows, but that's the power of Big Bird for you.",
            "I Am Big Bird is not great filmmaking but it pays fitting tribute to Spinney and the character into which he invested so much of his own personality.",
            "The purity of intent and sophisticated craft [Spinney] has poured into their creation remains unacknowledged by the general public. The modestly appointed, crowd-funded documentary I Am Big Bird should clear up that oversight once and for all.",
            "Spinney is well-deserving of the attention, and from a standpoint of sheer curiosity and fascination, knowing more about this man who created a character that we loved as children and that our children now love, is a gently poignant experience.",
            "This adulatory doco of Spinney's life and work is a handful of love stories glued together by Spinney, who is at the centre of it. A kinda This is Your Life doco",
            "While nice--arguably too nice, in fact--it feels like fifty minutes of material drawn out to nearly ninety.",
            " In less than 90 minutes, it's a reasonably complete history of the big Bird character and the man in it.",
            "Not a definitive story of Sesame Street, but it's a superb portrait of one of its longest residents, and a peek behind the scenes well worth taking for anyone who grew up with one of pop culture's most identifiable and most long-lived children's icons.",
            "Children love and understand the majestic galoot.",
            "I Am Big Bird: The Caroll Spinney Story, for the most part, is a puff piece. A feather film, if you will. It's as nice and flavorful and yellow as a Nilla cookie."

            "The whole thing looks like it cost its writer-directors, Fran\u00e7ois Simard, Anouk Whissell and Yoann-Karl Whissell, oh, maybe $1.98.",

            "With nods to Mad Max and a fun synth soundtrack, Turbo Kid packs plenty of retro affection and loopy fun, but its over-the-top violence gets tiresome; think Monty Python's Black Knight on endless repeat.",
            "It's a satire to be sure, but one that embraces its retro origins with an exuberance that is as much fun as it is nostalgic.",
            "Turbo Kid is a completely stupid, over the top, action-comedy with a heart. It's enjoyable if you are one of those who don't need their stories to make a whole lot of sense.",
            "Turbo Kid has the makings of a perfect midnight movie, and will be a nostalgic blast in the face for those of us old enough to remember, or at least those who have developed an affinity for, the cheap Mad Max knock offs of the early 1980s.",
            "It's strange stuff, but there is an endearing quality to it. What the movie lacks in budget, it does makes up for in imagination.",

            "Simultaneously cute and disgusting, this 80s throwback picture is a fun amalgam of Mad Max and BMX Bandits ...",

            "A beautiful and brilliant film from India. The objectivity and confidence of his fictional work, which follows the various participants in their daily lives, is astonishing for a filmmaker only 27 years old.",
            "An incisive upending of the nexus between legalese and tradition, Chaitanya Tamhane's authentic judicial drama gets into the cogs of India's censorship laws and their overlap with India's broken courts (and the people who keep them broken).",

            "The great thing about this work is it quietly and gradually accumulates into a brilliant comedy about contemporary India, with its many social, urban, and cultural layers.",

            "Court not only mirrors the reality of court proceedings but also makes us question our own beliefs and notions.",
            "Court is a rare film that creates drama out of the humdrum lives of ordinary people, whose limited world view and biases affect the lives of others in more ways than they can imagine.",
            "The result provides a memorable introduction to a filmmaker clearly working in opposition to the lavish escapism Bollywood has enabled over the years.",
            "The deliberate pacing risks trying our patience, but it's an accurate reflection of a system in stasis.",
            "Chaitanya Tamhane's quietly brilliant Court takes an individual court case and, through following its laborious labyrinthine process, creates a damning j'accuse of wider Indian society.",
            "A humane and absorbing big-city film.",
            "To borrow a phrase from a David Bowie song, Court is moviemaking at the speed of life, providing you still remember how life felt when moving at less than 100 miles an hour.",
            "A crude portrait of Indian society, profoundly injust and cruel. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Instead of dulling the drama, this almost journalistic approach to the narrative makes things tick with increasing urgency as the enormity of the system's ills and their impact on the ground are made clear."

            "Part Lynchian hallucination, part deadpan comedy, part existential musing, Rick Alverson's unique vision is fully realized, and even ugly, but demands to be watched.",
            "With Turkington's deft hand, Entertainment methodically deconstructs the world's shallow surfaces.",
            "There's a chic emptiness to \"Entertainment,\" undoubtedly, and anti-comedy constructs that may rub the wrong way, but there's also a spiky intelligence at work too, one that engages through the artifice of disengagement and the illusion of \"performance.\"",
            "It is not fun, but its confrontational style yields dividends.",
            "A daring and mainly successful black comedy about a dour and depressive comedian on a dead-end tour of California. ",
            "The Comedian is an ugly man with an ugly soul, and an ugly sense of comedy that at one point literally includes making fart noises for 90 full seconds as he pretends to gun down his silent audience with a soccer trophy.",
            "There's something powerful in Entertainment's ability to push down into the darkest depths without any hesitation.",
            "Entertainment challenges our tolerance for comic absurdity by making it confrontational. At times, it's hard to figure out whether you should be laughing, gasping or both.",
            "Rick Alverson's breakthrough film about a bitter, aging stand-up comedian who is a character that Nathaniel West might have conceived.",
            "It sparks interesting discussion on what actually is funny, what should be considered funny, who to respect as far as comedians go",
            "Though often slowly paced, Entertainment reveals itself as a remarkably dense, if not difficult film that rewards patience and a willingness to step into the anti-social mind.",
            "Entertainment is a fully realised and extremely accomplished translation of Gregg Turkington's Neil Hamburger character to the big screen.",
            "Alverson continues to zero in on the most brutal tendencies of contemporary comedy.",
            "It's difficult to give Alverson and his star too much credit for depth, insight or having a point. Because I'm not certain they have one. ",
            "This is one of those in-your-face, angry, confrontational movies. It wasn't just a chore to sit through, it was more like a homework assignment given to you by a teacher who hates your guts.",
            "A weird road flick about a weirdo stand-up comic with a weird repertoire. ",
            "An unsparing road trip through the barrenness of American pop culture and, by extension, the human soul.",
            "The Frankenstein-esque final scenes of Entertainment make it painfully clear: As much as we want to read them as social critique, Rick Alverson makes monster movies.",
            "Conjures an elegant portrait of a nation lost in a surrealist slipstream, drawing on the iconography of its past and the shell of its present. It's one of the best American movies of the year.",
            "It's the closest emulation of a waking nightmare in an American movie in a very long time. The anxiety is generalized, but it's also as specific as Hell. ",
            "A Greek tragedy told through the vessel of a small-time comedian, Entertainment is a bleak look into a broken man swallowed-up by second-rate showbusiness. ",
            "Gregg Turkington delivers a spot-on performance as a down-in-the-dumps comic in this gloomy offering. Too bad the film left me me in a deep funk too. ",
            "Like Hamburger's meta-hacky comedy routine, the film confronts and challenges in order to produce something increasingly rare in American cinema: an active, engaged experience.",
            "Weirdly compelling if student-y and unfocused ..."

            "The sadness and hopelessness of the story becomes overwhelming. ",
            "Berg has a secret weapon in the sermons Jeffs recorded for his flock: his bland, droning voice epitomizes the banality of evil.",
            "A chilling portrait of a megalomaniac.",
            "A film that feels horrifyingly urgent, even as it is, at times, nearly impossible to watch without squirming.",
            "The real story here, as in Deliver Us From Evil and An Open Secret, is that so many people knew what was going on and still did nothing.",
            "This isn't a one-person problem or a two-person problem. But rather than condemning and deconstructing the institution, Berg puts almost all of the focus on a couple awful men. ",
            "What results is a riveting documentary, an unintentional horror film that exposes what truly goes on behind the doors of one of the world's most evasive religious sects.",
            "What's shocking about the film, which is as effective in its way as HBO's Scientology expose, Going Clear is how widespread his ugly cult still is.",
            "Just in time for Halloween, Showtime is unleashing one of the creepiest, most depraved characters you'll ever see on television: Warren Steed Jeffs.",
            "Despite going too far in one of its arcs while not going far enough in the other, Prophet's Prey is still an excellent distillation of the FLDS and Jeffs, presenting as much information as possible behind this truly awful story.",
            "Despite the fragmented nature of Berg's exploration of this mysterious group, it's chilling when providing a comprehensive look at one happens when one twisted man convinces enough people that he speaks for God.",
            "A powerful, enraging and heartbreaking expos\u00e9.",
            "People of religious faith -- LDS Church members in particular -- will likely be disturbed to see how Jeffs was able to distort familiar doctrines into such awful ends.",
            "Prophet's Prey has few answers, but no shortage of blistering facts, and the sad hope that others can be saved. Eventually.",
            "Amy Berg's documentary about Jeffs and the FLDS is a study of evil disguised as virtue and of devotion taken to the extreme.",
            "Jeffs, to cut to the chase, is a monstrous madman and exploiter of the flesh... as devastating as Berg's 2006 Deliver Us From Evil.",
            "Berg lays down a narrative of warped religious authority and patriarchal abuse every bit as chilling as her pedophile priest expos\u00e9, \"Deliver Us From Evil.\"",
            "As horror upon horror unfolds in Prophet's Prey, Amy Berg's shocking documentary about the mad polygamist Warren Jeffs and his followers, one may marvel, in horror, at the elaborate forms that deviancy can take.",
            "At its best, this is an absorbing look at how people fall under the control of sick, sadistic hucksters.",
            "It speaks for itself. And what it says is scarier than any horror film this year.",
            "Prophet's Prey digs deep into the demons lurking within a hotly contentious church.",
            "For the most part ... Ms. Berg gets it right, burying Mr. Jeffs with persuasive witness testimony and documentation.",
            "Grim but riveting viewing, a layered commentary on this country's moral and spiritual underbelly.",
            "One watches the film with an escalating sense of disbelief and horror, as Warren Jeffs is steadily revealed to be an even greater monster than we initially take him for. "

            "Epic in scope, yet at the same time intensely intimate in its handling of its protagonist's inner life, it's a unique wildlife tale that sets a tribe of humans against a majestic pack of wolves.",

            "Warns us that an old-fashioned way of life is passing to an encroaching civilization.",
            "While visually stunning, this Chinese French collaboration is melodramatic and narratively disjointed. It is a man-and-his-dog story meets outsider-learning-to-appreciate-a-new culture story, just set in a place unfamiliar to Western audiences.",
            "if the film has a true star, it is the environment itself, which is enormous and daunting, dangerous, yet serene",
            "A true story that manages to seem both mythical and too fantastic to have really happened, Jean-Jacques Annaud's epic 3-D Wolf Totem is ultimately a hymn and a plea for ecological harmony.",
            "The four-legged creatures are more compelling than their two-legged counterparts in this visually stunning 3D adventure.",
            "Annaud and company make a bold environmental statement cloaked in a personal story of one young man's personal growth, change and awareness.",
            "Though Wolf Totem is notable for being a Chinese-scripted-and-shot film that actually offers some kind of critique of the communists, it nevertheless falls into a fairly well-worn story of an outsider growing to appreciate a culture he's come to change.",
            "Presented in IMAX 3D, there are scenes in this film that are literally breathtaking when they are not capturing or breaking the heart.",
            "At the film's core is a quirky love story between the student and the orphan wolf cub he finds and raises.",
            "It becomes difficult to separate the natives from their communist masters in terms of their treatment of their natural surroundings. ",
            "If it strives too hard for weighty import, Wolf Totem remains an occasionally stirring portrait of Mongolia's wolf population.",

            "Welcome to Leith is a sober, terrifying look at the very real monsters roaming the quiet countryside.",
            "Indeed, this could be the scariest film of the year.",
            "Tense, incisive, and remarkably objective ...",
            "Hand it to directors Michael Beach Nichols and Christopher K. Walker, who could have made the story into a black-hat/white-hat affair.",
            "The film is a must watch. The storytelling is strong and the imagery will give you pause. Here is hoping for wide distribution.",
            "Welcome to Leith doesn't really delve too deep into some of the topics it brings up, but its transformation of Leith's storyline into a tense, efficient narrative provides plenty of engrossing material.",
            "A disturbing tale that lacks information. Welcome to Leith feels vague as the documentary that should have told an extraordinary story. [Full review in Spanish].",
            "Tightly wound and terse throughout, Welcome to Leith ends on a note of disturbingly unresolved tension - the terror is real, even if it's only in your head.",
            "Some of the images seek for a closure that just isn't there... Given recent docs that have gone for the long haul, one wonders whether Walker might have been advised to have stuck around a little longer.",
            "In the end, this documentary, which has the mood of a Hollywood thriller, is about a plan that failed...Nothing hurts like failure.",
            "You come away from the film realizing that nothing Cobb could ever do to these people is as bad as what they do to themselves out of fear, which may have been his plan all along.",
            "Do not miss this true-life thriller.",
            "Welcome to Leith shows what Can Happen Here, though instead of the old warning \"watch the skies,\" those who can stomach it will have to keep their eyes on hate-speech websites.",
            "This is true-storytelling par excellence.",
            "Welcome to Leith delivers a psychological horror film, one more compelling and politically relevant than your average fiction offering in the genre.",
            "A thought-provoking offering that asks timely questions about the legal status of those espousing unpalatable ideologies, although the subject matter does involve extreme opinions some may find offensive.",
            "You are constantly reminded of the old saying: 'The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.' An unshowy but utterly compelling documentary.",
            "Framed as a thriller with Cobb as the villain - a role he seems to relish - the film captures plenty of candid footage and is impressive in its objectivity despite the obvious inclination to join the outrage.",
            "There's a superbly strong short documentary inside \"Welcome to Leith,\" but what's here remains quality work, only periodically fighting bouts of disorientation as it waits for something significant to return to town.",
            "The people of Leith went ballistic, and the almost biblical conflict that resulted is chronicled carefully in Michael Beach Nichols and Christopher K. Walker's film.",
            "\"Welcome to Leith,\" is an indictment against the white supremacist movement, racism, bigotry and hate.",
            "Michael Beach Nichols and Christopher K. Walker's often chilling documentary Welcome to Leith tells how a particularly low-IQ group of neo-Nazis attempted to take over the tiny hamlet of Leith, N.D."

            "Kilo Two Bravo is one of the most intense anti-war films extant.",
            "Mines detonate, the men hold on, the humour is the gallows' kind and the audience's gut is as tight as the tourniquets on the hurt soldiers' stumps.",
            "An intimate, unforgettable examination of war.",
            "Few war films are entertaining in a traditional sense. This one is so relentless that recoiling from it is nearly impossible.",
            "Once the men are on the riverbed facing a painful death, [director] Katis and screenwriter Tom Williams wind up the suspense to the point where even a rock cascading down a hill will have you holding your breath, waiting for the next bomb to detonate.",
            "It is an effective reminder of the youth, determination and heroism of the armed forces; a grisly modern-day coda to the upcoming Testament Of Youth.",
            "By casting unknowns, Katis only ratchets up the tension more, leaving his audiences breathless throughout, unable to second guess who might make it out alive.",
            "An arguably anti-war depiction of true events, yet one that expertly eschews the mawkish or sanctimonious didacticism such films frequently espouse.",
            "... more focused on character-driven moments than elaborate battlefield conflicts, yet it ratchets up the tension effectively.",
            "A rare, incredibly well executed film about brotherhood, tenacity and grit.",
            "The cast are fully believable, and the landscape - Jordan filling in for Afghanistan, as it did for Saudi Arabia in the recent release Theeb - provides another character, implacable and indifferent. War may be hell, but hell can be starkly beautiful too.",
            "While hardly a fun time at the movies, Kilo Two Bravo is a fine piece by first-time feature director Paul Katis.",
            "It's a relief that one can report that, strictly in aesthetic terms, it is indeed a well-made piece of work, executed with better-than-average levels of craftsmanship.",
            "Effectively tense and utterly unflinching in its depiction of battlefield carnage.",
            "Authentically harrowing.",
            "A gripping, and very tense drama that portrays the horrors of war while leaving interpretation open to the viewer, something rarely achieved in recent war movies.",
            "The strong, earthy performances by an experienced if unstarry cast bring profane integrity to a brave project.",
            "While the film-makers are clearly keen to pay tribute to the heroism of those involved, the film itself wisely avoids glib romanticism, opting instead for gruelling realism.",
            "Paul Katis' debut feature is a tense, rigorously realized portrait of British soldiers trapped in an Afghan minefield.",
            "Tense, blackly comic and troubling because it's so recent and so real.",
            "Working with an obviously low budget, newcomer Paul Katis whips a massive amount of tension into a nightmarish day endured by a group of British soldiers in Afghanistan.",
            "This suspenseful drama authentically reconstructs a disastrous rescue mission during the Afghan conflict.",
            "Driven by a diligent commitment to reality, the relatively unknown cast, first-time feature director Paul Katis and his expert prosthetic effects crew, turn the unfolding events into a nerve-shredding experience.",
            "This film possesses a lacerating power that reinforces its self-contained claustrophobia."

            "What it does do - is allow you to park your brain in neutral for 100 minutes, laugh at some silly jokes... and then walk out of theatre and immediately forget it ever happened. And there's nothing wrong with that. In fact, it's kind of refreshing.",
            "Not good, then, but not especially terrible and infinitely preferable to the excrescence of Hart's previous outing, Get Hard.",
            "The film is likeable but nowhere near as sharp or as funny as you hope it is going to be.",
            "You could make a better feature by repeatedly throwing a camera into a lake. ",
            "It's simply a shame to see a talented guy like Kevin Hart saddled with material that doesn't begin to live up to his immense comic range. ",
            "A listless retread with a few new wrinkles.",
            "Bland, lazy, and unable to elevate itself to the low standards of its predecessor, Ride Along 2 is a ride not work taking.",
            "All in all, more than simply being bad, Ride Along 2 is disappointing. ",
            "We admit it's a wild ride, but this one holds the road much better.",
            "\"Ride Along 2\" is one those sequels that didn't need to be made, but now that its existence can't be argued, should have and could have been better than it is.",
            "[Ride Along 2] is a film that misses far more often than it hits, filled with generic action sequences and tired one-liners.",
            "There is nothing inherently bad about this sequel, but there is nothing that hasn't been seen in pretty much any other film in the genre.",
            "Comedy sequels frequently deliver on being terrible, but Ride Along 2 is a case of extreme laziness. It's nothing more than an attempt at once again making gangbusters during the doldrums of January",
            "The heat is off.",
            "The plot is generic and hardly matters.",
            "If you've seen the global trailer for \"Ride Along 2,\" you've seen the entire movie.",
            "Ride Along 2 may be the first mainstream comedy in years to feature a cast this diverse and for that it deserves some sort of accolade. But that's it. Otherwise its the same eye-rolling numbskullery as the first.",
            "The shame of it is that the two leads have good chemistry together -- along with some decent support from Ken Jeong and Olivia Munn -- but they're stuck in a paint-by-numbers cop story that spends more time on its twists than being funny.",
            "This second helping does little more than add a bit of Miami glitz to a formula that wasn't especially inspired to begin with.",
            "Ride Along 2 follows in the indifferent footsteps of its predecessor.",
            "There are only so many bad things you can say about a film that left you genuinely bored and watching the clock, but there really isn't a redeeming feature and all I can say is, you'd be better off giving this one a miss.",
            "A wholly generic and predictable cop movie, not just in its plot but down to the tiniest details of its aesthetic."

            "Schwartzman ... gives Larry enough humanity and a modicum of personal growth that you keep coming back for more.",
            "Writer-director Bob Byington showed potential as a social satirist with his provocative 2008 indie RSO (Registered Sex Offender), but this slacker comedy lacks any such venom.",

            "7 Chinese Brothers is so slight it risks evaporating on contact.",
            "A very funny, resonant and, most importantly, self-aware film that allows a grade-A performer to show off his deadpan chops.",

            "\"7 Chinese Brothers,\" modest and unassuming, wins us over too, even though I can't figure out what the R.E.M. song has to do with the movie. Plus, it looks like Byington could only afford 2 Chinese brothers at most.",
            "It's a small film, with some great performances and one irrefutably cute dog.",
            "The project is more of a sketchy workshop than a fleshed-out feature, but at least Schwartzman's freewheeling banter provides some modest amusement.",
            "Byington's words elucubrated by Schwartzman's rich varieties of mutter and mumble and banter are one of the genuine moviegoing treasures of a not-completely-half-bad year for emphatically idiosyncratic comedy. I laughed. A lot. ",

            "The one bright spot is French bulldog Arrow (Schwartzman's own dog), who snorts and sighs and all but rolls his eyes in annoyance at the lifeless goings-on. We are Arrow; Arrow is us.",
            "You've seen this movie before in different guises. Byington does seem to have a vision of life, though, which is more than you can say for most comedy directors working at this budget level.",
            "Schwartzman is great at making Harry both sharply intelligent and not nearly as clever as he thinks he is. You also sense, in some lost look in his eye, a faint realization that life is passing him by.",
            "Considering how aimless its screenplay, how lost its hero and how unglamorous its setting, Bob Byington's \"7 Chinese Brothers\" is remarkably appealing.",

            "This is an expertly deejayed party without name-tags (until the credits), which on some level may be an appropriate manifestation of a shared, passed-down music that defines something collective about a people.",
            "\"Argentina\" provides a fine introduction to that country's traditional music and dance for those already familiar with it. The contradiction in that statement is why this pretty film is also a frustrating one.",
            "Minor but highly watchable ...",
            "Carlos Saura's Argentina is really a concert film, unique in that the only spectator is the camera.",
            "Though the dancers dance beautifully, the singers sing melodically and the musicians play soulfully, it is all without meaning, like one seamless but context-free concert on a bare stage.",
            "The vignettes are connected, though -- visually through Saura's habit of enlarging and distorting imagery, and spiritually through his unabashed love of his subject. ",
            "Saura proves once again, he is the best in the business capturing dance on film. In this case he has the added advantage of two wildly cinematic show-stopping numbers.",
            "There's music and dance galore, but the Argentinian cognoscenti will best appreciate this doc, while others may be less diverted.",
            "Carlos Saura's direction feels less like the work of a masterclass DJ of a specific musical culture than that of a great artist dutifully hopping from one former hit to the next.",
            "What's refreshing is that this doc about Argentina's rich folklore avoids clich\u00e9 by covering every dance and song BUT the tango."

            "Magic Mike XXL sort of plays like the lesser sequel to the movie we all thought the original would be.",
            "If the film looks and moves like a Soderbergh movie, it has a different feel than the original; it's lighter, for good and ill, an encore without much of an agenda. ",
            "Magic Mike XXL is the cinematic inverse to Magic Mike, swapping out the drama for wild, blazing cuts at physical comedy and leaving behind the first film's dark aches for a friendly happiness.",
            "[Magic Mike XXL] has an easy, engaging flow, at once natural and dreamlike.",
            "It's a reinforcement of some elements of the first film, but also a departure in ways that make it more thoughtful than its predecessor without ever undermining its commitment to entertain.",
            "If you're really expecting more from Magic Mike XXL than gyrating and pulsating, then you're really going to be disappointed.",

            "Plot-free, significance-free, character development-free and crotch-in-face heavy, Magic Mike XXL is a cheerful, inconsequential bit of jiggle and thrust, buoyed by a few strong performers.",
            "In a summer dominated by reboots and superhero movies, MMXXL is at once a thoughtful throwback and a gleeful example of how to cater to audiences without pandering to them.",
            "Bulging biceps and famous abs can only do so much; sometimes less is just less. ",
            "Pure fun, plain and simple. A buddy road film for the ages, there's enough sexual innuendo to tide you over until next year, enough nervous giggles elicited to keep your mind wandering and plenty of good feelings that leave you wanting more.",
            "It's an honest-to-goodness good time, and on a cinematic level, it's far from trashy.",
            "The biggest problem with Magic Mike XXL is that from the very start, the film doesn't find its footing and never manages to. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "The dances are hotter, the laughs funnier and thankfully, there's no lame love story.",
            "When \"Magic Mike XXL\" doesn't take itself seriously, it's actually kind of funny... Unfortunately, most of the time the film tries to take itself way too seriously.",
            "...Magic Mike XXL delivers on the first film's promise...judging by the audience of near-rabid women I saw the movie with, it was a borderline religious experience.",
            "It is not any more ambitious than its characters, but it's a splendid example of what it is. If accomplishing laid-out goals, however modest, is a definition of success, this succeeds completely.",
            "MAGIC MIKE XXL is a sex-positive comedy that invites the audience to talk about sex in a productive and provocative fashion.",
            "This was made for a very specific demographic in mind, and for all of those amped-up sexpots looking for nothing more than cheap, tawdry thrills - this Mike is magic.",
            "Certainly there are a zillion sarcastic cracks to be made about male strippers on one last run and the women who pay them. The film will polarise audiences but seriously there are worse things in life than a movie about stripping.",
            "A hell of a good time for those willing to settle into its easygoing vibe, especially during its climactic, impeccably choreographed showcase, which sent me home with a big, goofy grim plastered on my face.",
            "You get lost in the absurdity and joy of this seemingly hopeless endeavor."

            "Attempting to capture the screwball essence of the old-school suspense-comedy ... Lawrence Michael Levine's flighty \"Wild Canaries\" lacks the filmmaking discipline required to pay effective homage.",
            "Cute or presumptuous? It's your call where \"Wild Canaries\" is concerned.",
            "The genre play is an interesting take on what has become a clich\u00e9 genre of Brooklyn relationship dramedy. But unfortunately, the execution is bungled along the way, and the film ends up feeling like not quite one thing and not quite the other.",
            "It offers an unpredictable ride that's kind of fun, or at least sporadically simulates fun. ",
            "It's evident that the film is largely a lark, that Levin is having fun creating comic sparks by smashing a murder mystery together with a group of self-centered detectives, plot details be damned.",
            "Despite an appealing cast, though, neither comedy nor suspense really takes flight until very near the end, largely due to a script that isn't equal to the filmmakers' enthusiasm.",
            "While there are funny moments, mostly coming from Levine and Shawkat's performances, most of the film is lackluster, especially the relationships between the characters.",
            "[Lawrence Michael] Levine juices the intrigue with humor (a dub-intensive score elevates the tension), and that helps to keep things engaging, but man oh man, can these people be exasperating.",
            "Clearly, Canaries is all about the couple at its core, who are both drawn smoothly. ",
            "Married filmmakers Takal and Levine have an easy rapport, and they elicit likable performances from all their cast. (Even the villains are hard to hate.)",
            "This screwball noir about a Brooklyn couple who investigate the death of their elderly neighbor is an enthusiastic but bungled effort at a comedic thriller.",
            "Levine deftly toes the seriocomic line, making us sure nothing underhanded has actually occurred in one scene and making us question that certainty in the next.",
            "It's like \"Scooby-Doo\" for the artisanal cupcake set.",
            "A delightful diversion that succeeds in spoofing the film noir genre while simultaneously spinning a thoroughly-modern variation on the theme of those classic crime capers.",
            "The stars of the show are Levine and Takal, whose performances not only perfect the film's comic tempo, but also suggest that their real-life relationship has influenced every frustrated argument and passionate kiss seen in the film.",
            "Like much of Woody Allen's mid-career work, it's a light romantic comedy handled with aplomb. ",
            "'Wild Canaries' is a polished indie homage to screwball comedy, but its retro fever is not shallow. Its understanding of the subgenre runs deep.",
            "At its core, Wild Canaries is a reminder that relationships require a sense of adventure, and maybe a little mystery, to keep the magic alive. Indie comedies, as the film proves, benefit from the same.",
            "On paper, \"Wild Canaries\" sounds like it has all the ingredients for a reasonably diverting comedy, but they just never quite pull together into a cohesive or entertaining whole.",
            "Setting this pair of squirrelly, suspicious minds loose on matters of love and death, Mr. Levine spins a caper that wins you over more through tenacity than through originality.",
            " It's rare for a film that feels this loose to be populated by men and women so precisely constructed that they could've been pulled right out of a novel. ",
            "Dusting off the kind of screwball whodunit that the Thin Man series once perfected, this update cleverly clashes old genre tropes against the backdrop of modern Brooklyn.",
            "Lawrence Michael Levine's film occupies a sweet spot between the self-aware and taut.",
            "As performers, Levine and Takal are both practiced and casual; as a director, Levine displays a sharp comedic touch; the result is self-deprecating and self-revealing."

            "If comedy is tragedy plus time, is stand-up comedy a kind of higher math used to survive that equation? ",
            "With so many subjects, it's obvious the director is going for quantity, but it doesn't work (especially the scenes with Matthew Perry; a funny actor is much different from a professional stand-up). The overall tone feels scattered and self-important.",
            "If you want to be a comedian, see this Kevin Pollak documentary first. However, although amusing and enlightening, it's also a bit scary and incoherent at times. ",

            "A documentary that asks many comics big questions about the dispositions of comics - but doesn't often enough put anyone off balance, the audience included.",
            "Commingling industry shoptalk with introspective insights and wrangling testimonials, the film casts an incredibly wide net, but doesn't reveal much of anything. ",
            "What might have turned out to be a movie about comedy only for comedians is instead a funny and engaging look at the most twisted and naked branch of the entertainment world."

            "Do you have to be sad to be funny? You'll have to sit through a slew of micro-anecdotes and shop talk before you get any answers from this choppy documentary - longer than any decent comic would defer a punchline.",
            "We hear plenty of engaging anecdotes, though, taken together, they don't do much to illuminate a subject that has been thoroughly explored elsewhere ...",
            "Are they miserable? No; everyone seems to be having a great time. Are they funny? Um, not so much.",
            "For the most part ... this is a pretty safe discussion about a very unsafe art form. We can only imagine what's in the outtakes.",
            "An evident labor of love and also a work of grating amateurism.",
            "While genial and never dull, the film is all over the place, a classic example of trying to do and say too much.",
            "Pollak only gets round to misery right at the end, in a quick-fire sequence of comedians either agreeing or disagreeing that you have to be miserable to be funny. By then, though, you'll probably have stopped caring.",
            "[Kevin] Pollak isn't taking a solve-for-x approach here so much as simply geeking out with his fellow tribesmen (and a few -women), who may or may not be your favorite funny people, anyway.",
            "Because he packs the film as tightly as the star-studded The Aristocrats, none of these issues receive in-depth exploration, but it's more of a survey than a psychoanalytic exercise.",
            "It's a decent enough film for comedy buffs though there aren't a whole lot of surprises.",
            "If only he had probed a bit deeper, and widened his scope beyond the predominantly white, male subjects (including our own Rob Brydon, Steve Coogan and Stephen Merchant), this could have been a fascinating film as well as a funny one.",
            "Overall, what we get is a relentless conveyer belt of talking heads, earnestly dissecting their profession.",
            "If comedy is tragedy plus time, is stand-up comedy a kind of higher math used to survive that equation? ",
            "With so many subjects, it's obvious the director is going for quantity, but it doesn't work (especially the scenes with Matthew Perry; a funny actor is much different from a professional stand-up). The overall tone feels scattered and self-important.",
            "If you want to be a comedian, see this Kevin Pollak documentary first. However, although amusing and enlightening, it's also a bit scary and incoherent at times. ",
            "There was a time when all this might have felt, if not revelatory, then perhaps not quite as exhausted as it does during this particular moment in popular culture.",
            "Might have been a better movie if [director Kevin Pollak had] rejected some of the five-dozen funny (or not) people who volunteered.",
            "The niche it aims to fill has already been occupied by people willing to go much deeper than Pollak. ",
            "While there's no single, monumental insight here-no a-ha moment that cracks the code of comedy-there are a ton of stories and opinions that comedy nerds should love.",
            "Explaining humor is usually like boiling water - it evaporates. But the funny folks in actor Kevin Pollak's well-structured doc can actually break down what they do.",
            "Pollak obviously had fun, but you get the feeling the best bits never made it in.",
            "A documentary that asks many comics big questions about the dispositions of comics - but doesn't often enough put anyone off balance, the audience included.",
            "Commingling industry shoptalk with introspective insights and wrangling testimonials, the film casts an incredibly wide net, but doesn't reveal much of anything. ",
            "What might have turned out to be a movie about comedy only for comedians is instead a funny and engaging look at the most twisted and naked branch of the entertainment world."

            "For a movie that wants to send a message about privilege and prejudice, it displays a clumsiness and exemplifies a lot of the ignorance and thoughtlessness it wants to rage against.",
            "It's all awful enough that you expect the movie to end with a title card that proclaims, \"Don't worry, guys - we have gay friends and black friends. We're cool.\"",
            "A confused and contradictory mess.",
            "I wanted to tell the film-makers where to shove it, but having seen the movie it's clear that they've already done so.",
            "The film exists in an alternate reality, where lots of guns are waved and no one gets shot, and where deadly situations pop up but result in barely a drop of spilt blood.",
            "They're a pretty incredible comic duo even in a remarkably average film.",
            "Get Hard features the type of jokes you'd expect from a title that's an innuendo itself. The outrageous laughs almost make the plot unimportant but ultimately fit the style Ferrell is known for. ",
            "Uninspired and unfunny, Get Hard is further evidence that Ferrell needs a career intervention.",
            "Instead of lampooning racial difference or satirising white collar crime, it opts for the easiest, most crowd pleasing humour, and hammers the screen with jokes that get old almost as soon as you hear them.",
            "There are some chuckles to be had here, because with such gifted and reliable talent that's pretty much a given. But the vehicle that houses Hart and Ferrell is so scummy and poorly crafted it isn't worth anyone's time.",
            "Ferrell and Hart prove to have really good chemistry... But for every positive moment the two generate, you get three or four moments that don't work.",
            "I was offended by the film's laziness. It confuses being shocking and obnoxious with being edgy. Instead of finding the line and cleverly crossing it, it finds the line and takes a greasy, self-righteous dump on it.",
            "So when you sit in this movie and can count on one hand the number of times you laugh, it's disappointing, especially when it's the same joke repeated over and over and over again.",
            "For all the yammering about Get Hard being too racist or too homophobic, much of the chatter that has been lost is that it just isn't funny.",
            "So let the racist stereotyping and gay-panic high jinks begin!",
            "Get Hard tries to highlight the reality that there are two very different sides to Los Angeles. The problem is that it does so in the most cartoonish way possible.",
            "Will Ferrell randomly yelling baked potato with a shiv stuck in his forehead is gold",
            "It's awash in jokes reeking of racism and homophobia, and while I'm sure that the films creators would argue that they're simply trying to air out these differences, they utterly lack the finesse to walk that line.",
            "The weird thing, though, is that Get Hard isn't mean-spirited. It's just bad comedy falling short of its mark in the worst possible way.",
            "It's offensive to minorities, it's offensive to gay people, and it's offensive to the lead actor's resumes.",
            "A deformed composite of every buddy comedy ever made, sliced and diced to the point of total anonymity. The characters aren't buddies and the premise isn't comedic.",
            "Too often the filmmakers rely on lowest-common-denominator prison rape jokes and lazy plotting to allow for action-comedy set pieces."

            "Bill Plympton's latest feature-length animation, about a loving couple riven by infidelity, contains some of his loveliest fantasy sequences, though the gap between his visual and storytelling skills persists.",
            "You certainly can't fault Plympton for ambition. If only the jokes were a little stronger!",
            "It certainly was an enriching experience to watch.",
            "There's a messy beauty to the scribbled hatching and extremely loose shapes jittering in their imperfections from one frame to the next.",
            "Movement is of the essence here, and it's really something to see these irrepressibly protean figures put through their emotional paces.",
            "Now and again, the movie feels like a compilation of short \"Plymptoons\" that happen to share a theme and a pair of characters.",
            "By far the best of the four or five of the seven Plympton features that I've seen. What he used to do with faces, he now does with figures, abstracting them to Plastic Man arms and s-curves.",
            "Perhaps [Plympton's] most ambitious and visually impressive work yet.",
            "The visuals are consistently brilliant, Plympton's delving into human nature is unparalleled in recent animation, and the imaginative conceits that spit forth without respite are very near mind-blowing. He's a Rube Goldberg of the psyche.",
            "At times it comes to life, but for the most part it's a bit one-note and repetitive.",
            "...Cheatin' at least proves that though hand-drawn animation may be one of the oldest forms of the medium, it's plenty lively and colorful when its practitioners care.",
            "In an earnest bid to balance noir and nutty, neither benefits, in this otherwise anti-Disney fantasy freakout counting super-macho misery and objectified devious damsels in undress popping up. Perhaps revealing more about the filmmaker than anything else.",
            "\"Cheatin'\" is a highlight of Plympton's robust body of work because motion-not the journey, or the destination-is always its creator's priority.",
            "Even at 76 minutes it feels stretched, but Plympton's vivid hand-drawn visuals-one sequence hurls a man through a boxcar, into the sky, underwater, and off a cliff-never lose their electric charge.",
            "Like every other great animator, from Chuck Jones to Hayao Miyazaki, Mr. Plympton rewrites the laws of physics at will, but within a rigorous and coherent logic. He conjures a world of absolute improbability that, somehow, makes perfect sense.",
            "Like trying to drink a gallon of chocolate syrup without a milk chaser.",
            "Cheatin' offers little narrative or emotional advantage over watching a series of the director's more concise works. At 76 minutes, it should play like a short feature. Instead, it's more like an extra-long short.",
            "Plympton manages to keep it lively with one stunningly kinetic setpiece after another, many of which could easily be airlifted out of the picture to function as stand-alone shorts.",
            " It's hard to imagine any American studio movie this year that possesses the same liberating creativity found here. "

            "With its casual deadpan attitude, Buzzard offers a nightmare portrait of arrested development and anomie for the age of inequality.",
            "Potrykus's puckishly outrageous visions are short on insight, but they pack an enduring hallucinatory power.",
            "Burge is phenomenal here, giving a memorable, well-rounded performance. His take on Marty is not your typical cinematic slacker: all cool detachment and na\u00efve apathy.",
            "Love it, hate it or tolerate it with reluctance, \"Buzzard\" has a ruthless clarity of vision, and breaks new ground in pushing character-based comedy right to the edge of profound discomfort.",
            "Tough to categorize, tougher to shrug off, \"Buzzard\" firmly places young indie filmmaker Joel Potrykus on the ones-to-watch list.",

            "Coming of age movies are generally about finding your voice, but this film of troubled youth is a terrifying variation: it's about losing yourself. I didn't enjoy watching Buzzard, but I admire it as a character study of a tragic a--hole.",
            "The leisure culture presented by [director Joel] Potrykus is endemic and responds to radical changes in social and labor paradigms, not only in the United States, but in the world... [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Lacking a third act, Buzzard is less of a complete story than a slow-motion car crash, but then again, there are few things more fascinating than car crashes.",
            "A truly indie American comedy that will entertain you with its constant twists. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Marty seems intended to exemplify modern American discontent, but a slacker hero is false to this political moment of digital entrepreneurs. His immature \"rebellion\" patronizes the very audience...that the young adult Marty resembles.",
            "Buzzard, written, directed and edited by Joel Potrykus, who plays Marty's work friend Derek, is a comedy that grows less funny by the scam, deepening desperation and eruption of white-hot anger.",

            "Its oddly jumbled machinery never clicks. The logic of Chappie gradually disintegrates, becoming increasingly farcical.",
            "Blomkamp has retained his flare for gorgeous production design and interesting ideas, unfortunately with Chappie, those ideas are all recognizable from other, better pieces of entertainment.",
            "The principal charm of the film arises from Chappie's ears, which prick up and droop like those of a titanium rabbit.",
            "Blomkamp's strength lies in his unabashed populism, an extension of his sympathy with the underdog.",
            "The concept of creating AI that must learn through observation is one with vast potential, yet it feels considerably restricted within the walls of a derivative action movie.",
            "On a storytelling level, Chappie mixes a sweetness and a swagger that becomes quite addictive.",
            "It is neither as good as it could have been nor as bad as many will say it is.",
            "Like the robots populating it, the film desires to be something more but lacks the heart to get there.",
            "Chappie is a brilliant examination of what it means to be human and what exactly constitutes a soul.",
            "Despite flashes of brilliance, Chappie's script often resembles a list of stuff that would be cool to see in a movie rather than an actual story.",
            "Chappie packs a shocking climax into a movie which focuses on growth, humanity, and innocence. ",
            "Chappie needs one and all to leave practicality, a desire for authentic social statements, and distaste for over-the-top story and character at home. If you can't do that, stay home yourself.",
            "Had it been more unhinged and odd or had it been dramatically less Die Antwoord-ly focused, Chappie could have been more than the haphazard hot mess it is.",
            "Chappie is an amalgam of better movies.",
            "Within Chappie, there is an almost perfect short film; an inventive take on a mechanical consciousness developing under unusual circumstances. If only the additional 100 minutes could have sustained this.",
            "Chappie is an extraordinary film. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "I think even Blomkamp's biggest fans will find Chappie quite disappointing.",
            "The movie is definitely lacking in terms of narrative succinctness, which comes primarily from asking far more questions than it is capable of answering in two hours.",
            "Blomkamp keeps things moving but has plenty of time for grace notes. Most importantly, he makes us care about all of the characters, so that by the end, we're genuinely invested it how it all turns out.",
            "It's sure starting to look like we've hit the boundaries of Neill Blomkamp's particular wheelhouse. ",
            "It's clear that there are just a few too many bugs in this machine. ",
            "The film has plenty of potential with its themes and ideas, but other than its titular character there is no one participating in this story to care about."

            "The imagery, in scenes that always unfold slowly, is truly startling, particularly given that the film is almost 90 years old.",
            "Flaherty's company are performing their lives and their ancestors' lives and Flaherty's idea of both, for him, for his camera, for the world of '26, for us today, for all time.",
            "A magnified travel film, it's interesting and has been well done, but there's no story, and a travelog is a travelog.",
            "Flaherty's sticky romanticism can't obscure the power of his images, which speak with an eloquence the intertitles lack.",
            "While the sounds don't always fit perfectly, it's remarkable how natural they often seem, providing a more accessible portrait of Savai'i, even if it is no longer 100% authentic.",
            "But still, it's all a lie. A beautiful lie; a lie that provides a crucial glimpse into the past of a colonized culture. But a lie nonetheless. ",
            "A delight.",
            "Don't go into Moana with Sound expecting an accurate anthropological depiction-just look forward to the drama and intergenerational negotiation of reality and fiction. ",

            "Moana is praiseworthy as a glimpse into Samoan life, but it is even more remarkable for [Robert] Flaherty's imagery.",
            "Flaherty catches it all by coming up with the needed stylistics as the occasions arise.",
            "It is a joyful and at the same time a thoroughly artistic contribution to motion pictures."

            "Cut Snake is an unexpected and invigorating piece of work, blessed with a simply brilliant central performance.",
            "In terms of plot and motivation ... an illogical mess that no amount of carefully moody cinematography can save.",
            "Performances keep the tension building toward an incendiary climax.",
            "It's a big movie, despite its small circle of characters, and rewarding for adventurous viewers.",
            "Performances are uniformly impressive, with Stapleton guaranteed a place in the pantheon of creepily charismatic Australian screen criminals.",
            "Ayres and screenwriter Blake Ayshford take a familiar premise down a surprisingly knotty path that makes for an intriguing and apprehensively sweaty yarn.",
            "Nevertheless, lumpy, repetitive plotting keeps matters at a low simmer.",
            "Its title suggests a hint of madness: instead, it's utterly conventional and lacking in fangs.",
            "It's a minor story with minor ambitions, yet it manages to deliver a fully satisfying and moving experience.",
            "In Tony Ayres' Cut Snake, the true blue Aussie crime flick gets a queer coat of paint. It masks itself as a standard crime flick, but subverts what we have come to expect from these films...",
            "A tough little crime drama full of muted anger, growled dialogue and whispered threats...Much as we applaud the achievements of filmmakers working on small budgets, you can't hand out free passes when those limitations hobble the flow and feel of a film.",
            "An inconsistent film covering too much familiar ground, Cut Snake often gets distracted by the need to service an admittedly striking (though largely pointless) 1970s production design.",
            "Artfully shot by Simon Ford, with fine period detail from production designer, Josephine Ford, Cut Snake is technically top-notch, and emotionally uncompromising, as Ayres again strides into largely virgin territory for Australian cinema.",
            "Perhaps the low-ish budget shows here and there, but Ayres' filming of Blake Ayshford's script has a fittingly lived-in '70s look, a cool soundtrack, strong work from the leads (and the supporting cast) and, at times, a sense of real foreboding.",
            "A young crim out of jail, trying to go straight... hardly an original concept, but Blake Ayshford's screenplay gives it a novel twist and extra layers, while director Tony Ayres pushes for an edgy delivery",
            "Is wasting a great idea better than having none at all? It's up for debate in Cut Snake, where one smart spin on crime caper conventions just isn't enough."

            "After a quarter-century, Poltergeist remains one of the most popular movies whose reputation rests almost exclusively on behind-the-scenes diversions.",

            "Given the talents, Poltergeist is an annoying film because it could have been so much better.",
            "One of the all-time great haunted-house epics.",
            "Poltergeist doesn't deserve serious attention... It lacks minimal logic and a coherent objective. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "The sweet, angelic face of Heather O'Rourke swirled together with viscous, ectoplasmic demons and food abominations make for an uncomfortable yet unforgettable movie watching experience",
            "A slick, entertaining ghost story and a stomach-turning gore-fest in equal measure, the balance of Spielberg and Hooper's creative impulses blending together.",
            "Spielberg's intent may be satirical, but I find these stereotypes even more depressing than hobgoblins, and would not have minded if they'd all been dragged off into the fourth dimension.",
            "One of the 1980s' most distinctive and important horror movies.",
            "The buildup is slow and deliberate, creating a vivid sense of love and warmth within the family who share the harrowing adventure.",
            "Hooper's direction may lack its usual edgy personality -- apparently over-ruled by Spielberg's script suggestions -- but he puts on a dazzling show, and the intuitive performances are uniformly on the panic button.",

            "Paper Towns is a breathtakingly vanilla adaptation of another soppy novel from The Fault in Our Stars author John Green.",
            "An engaging, if familiar, mix of teen rites of passage, the fun of friendship and mooning over a cool girl. Still, Nat Wolff and Cara Delevingne make for a watchable duo.",

            "The worst thing about Paper Towns isn't that it's poorly made or majorly flawed; it's that it's so humble and plain and unexciting that it saps the life out of you. It even sucks the life out of its talents.",
            "Nevertheless, this is a charming, engaging movie.",
            "It's actually quite harmless, and, at the end of a very long, slow, uneventful journey, it has an excellent message. I just wish the point could have been made with a little more panache.",
            "Look up the definition of \"paper towns.\" Reading the definition in a dictionary will be more entertaining than seeing this movie.",
            "'Paper Towns' is an admirable film more due to what it tries to do, than to the final product, and although it does entertain, it could've done a lot more. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "A healthy amount of self-deprecating humor and self-awareness would have saved this well-intentioned (if meek) script from eternal mediocrity.",
            "Ferris Bueller said it best: 'Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.' 'Paper Towns' reminds us not to miss our life.",
            "Overall, Paper Towns is a good and solid, if somewhat lengthy, film. The film is structurally and visually conventional with the odd glimmer of indie quirk.",
            "Destined to play second banana to last year's critical and commercial darling \"The Fault In Our Stars.\" But as second bananas go, it's not a bad one.",
            "A smart script peppered with genuinely witty dialogue and some nuanced acting by a young ensemble cast at least keep this coming-of-age story watchable throughout.",
            "This is not a film that stings, lasts or moves - it's just a nice indie movie at the end of the day.",
            "With the overarching story so unengaging, coupled with Margot's fondness for making worldly statements no 18-year-old can say without sounding pretentious, this turns out to be better on paper.",
            "With a simple storyline that can be slow at times, Cara Delevingne's new movie will earn a place in the hearts of teenage filmgoers. But it doesn't offer the same emotional punch as The Fault In Our Stars.",
            "Margo's departure leaves us in the company of characters who are way less interesting than her, and the answer to her mystery, when it comes, hardly seems worth the wait."

            "Slam-bang bravado, non-stop adventure, and overall modest fun, based loosely on a science-fiction story by Richard Bachman (a.k.a. Stephen King).",
            "With little or nothing to extract from the performances, with a production design that screams \"I'm from the eighties !!\" at the slightest opportunity, and lack of ingenuity. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "It's a remarkably prescient media satire, presaging the reality TV craze by almost 15 years and even went so far as to cast Family Feud's Richard Dawson as the show's egomaniacal host.",
            "It is a rare movie. It was thirty years ago and still today it looks like one of the most 'Martian' films of the golden age of Schwarzenegger. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "The Running Man remains as much fun to watch as it was back in 1987 and thanks to a perceived drop in social standards it is more relevant now than it has ever been.",
            "Holds up a shocking reflection of where we actually stand as a society in 2017.",
            "One of those movies that's a lot of fun to watch without being particularly good, The Running Man is a chintzy-looking affair that gets by on stunt casting and a killer concept.",
            "Give the movie credit for being prescient: Given the disgusting rise and success of reality TV, it's not difficult at all to imagine fans of garbage like Survivor or Jersey Shore easily turning into the audience for a deathsport show like The Running Man.",
            "It's an arcade-game romp done with flair.",
            "Only Richard Dawson -- brilliantly cast -- redeems this mess with a superior performance.",
            "The fun of the movie is really in its premise, its cool confrontations between Arny & villains, the cheezy one-liners and Maria Conchita-Alonso in tights!",
            "Richard Dawson's best performance in a film.",
            "The licenses taken with King's original tale only serve to make a more effective movie."

            "The unhurried storytelling matches Adaline's endless life, making this a respectable date movie.",
            "Like Adaline, the film gives the sense of being somewhat uncomfortable in 2015, but while the movie makes a case for romanticizing the past, Adaline's story shows the limitations of detaching yourself from the present.",
            "Lively is appealing, natural and often touching.",
            "Immortality can be depressing, but immortality when you have no discernible personality is truly terrifying. If the film were even the slightest bit aware of the macabre message it sends, it might be worth wasting a few mortal minutes on.",
            "Lively does a good line in aloof, and if Huisman never convinces as the object of her desire then the narrative's peripheral relations more than fill the emotional gap.",
            "A quaintly disarming fairy tale, refusing any date that isn't written in the stars.",
            "The excessively science-fiction-steeped setup only undermines the parts that work.",
            "The joy of Lively's performance is that she creates a sympathetic and appealing character out of Adaline.",
            "Gorgeous on a visual basis, but remains empty behind a heavily contrived plot, preposterous scientific mumbo jumbo, and unabashed romantic exaggeration.",
            "One minute I'm baffled and the next minute I'm quite literally falling asleep.",
            "This movie is so bizarre.",
            "It is a film with a good technical polishing that takes great care to be an elegant production, but has much less success in achieving a content that at least approaches the level of its form. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "Ross's voice resonates in our heads with the same intensity as it did in Dominik's film, capturing the essence of the story with its kind, direct and serious tone. Unfortunately, the images say otherwise. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "The audience is certainly offered plenty of beautiful bone structure featured in languid close-ups of the two leads, along with jewel-like, memorable moments of acting prowess from the older actors.",
            "Takes its premise and squanders it on a run-of-the-mill romance that doesn't have the courage to tackle its themes head on.",
            "The plot is both ridiculous and overly convenient, stealing screentime from the deserving thorough period production design.",
            "The film's greatest gift might be that it harbors one of Ford's best performances in years. You can never tell these days how invested he'll be in any given project, but Krieger must have the magic touch. ",
            "I thought Lively was strong enough in the role and the chemistry between all was so good I enjoyed it.",
            "If you are looking for a romance film with hints of science fiction, this is it. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "It's a lovely idea, but the film misses the mark.",
            "The Age of Adaline is a plushly packaged and has its fantasy charms, but it could have been infinitely more impactful.",
            "It's a film that takes itself way too seriously, even when there are campy elements that keep creeping into the material. It kept me interested to a point, before ultimately collapsing under the weight of its own silliness.",
            "For a movie about a woman who has lived for more than a hundred years, it's disappointing - and more than a little bit baffling - that Adaline is so lacking in dimension.",
            "It has the powerful tang of nostalgia, memory for things we knew or didn't know. It reminds us that time is precious and it's never too late to make a good life."

            "A simple story of coming of age and the bitter failings of hero worship that succeeds thanks to the impressive skills of its young star.",
            "Rolleston's winning presence doubtless has much to do with the fact that Boy is a record-breaking hit in its home country, but there's some salt mixed in with the film's sugar.",
            "\"Boy\" finds hope, and love, in the oddest corners.",
            "Waititi has reached into his past for a story that belongs to him alone.",

            "The film may be slight, but there's plenty of charm and wit to engage and amuse.",
            "[A] breezy coming-of-age story.",
            "It's relentlessly funny but depends in equal part on the charm of its characters and on Boy's sense of wonder at the world.",
            "The momentum from the opening dissipates early and without a real engine pushing the movie foward, it begins to drag...the film is 87 minutes and feels like it's 2 hours.",
            "This is an upbeat, often hilarious, but never mawkish, celebration of love.",
            "It's one of those flicks that has more resonance than you may at first realize and a level of charm that few films contain.",
            "A film like this would have little chance without the right casting, and James Rolleston is so right as Boy, it's difficult to imagine anyone else.",
            "A performer and comedian before becoming a filmmaker, Waititi uses his comic sensibilities to keep Boy from becoming mawkish or clich\u00e9d. He has created a coming-of-age tale that is truly original.",
            "Boy is a charmer, a funny and affecting coming-of-age story rendered with heart, and with nuttiness.",
            "Waititi does a nice tonal juggling act, balancing eccentric characters, a 1980s setting, child-drawn animation and Maori-inflected restagings of Michael Jackson videos with the painful consequences of parental neglect.",
            "\"Boy\" is a delightful discovery, a charming little film about fathers, sons, New Zealand and Michael Jackson.",
            "This is a good-natured, goofy and often charming little coming-of-age comedy that is bright, light and fun.",
            "It's serious stuff, but with a veneer of cheeky comedy.",
            "Homegrown though it often feels, the film is hurt by a distinct lack of budget; how else to explain why \"Thriller,\" or any song at all by Michael Jackson, never appears? ",
            "Funny and touching at times, but a little bit of Dad goes a long way.",
            "\"Boy'' rollicks along with bright, sunny style and, for the most part, balances its sadness with invention."
