            "Coupled with Connery's magnetic performance, that's enough to make The Hunt for Red October as watchable today as it was during its 1990 release.",
            "Clancy is known for writing difficult books, but the movie makes plausible a preposterous situation because of Baldwin's convincing, low-key approach to being a film hero.",
            "You may not be limp from accumulated tension when this hunt is over, but its cautiously upbeat global message leaves a satisfying glow and it operates with a crackerjack premise.",
            "An exciting techno-suspense thriller with a hollow center.",
            "Though Hunt shows fitful signs of life, it lacks the human drama of Das Boot, the technical dazzle of The Abyss and the old-fashioned brio of Run Silent, Run Deep.",
            "Red October is an idealized, dreamy fantasy of life in the business world-harmless as airplane reading, a bit dull on the big screen.",
            "With enough of a corkscrew plot to keep anyone guessing and with plenty of edge-of-your-seat suspense, this high-stakes espionage thriller never misses a beat.",
            "With a chilly majesty to its scale despite its confined locations, this is a supremely confident film with the courage of its convictions as the story slowly and steadily unfolds. 30 years on it still packs a powerful punch, the tension ratcheting. ",
            "It's to McTiernan's credit that so much of this is made intense. Every silence on board the Russian sub, whether they're squeaking through a narrow underwater canyon or sending out a single sonar ping, seems occasion to hold your breath.",
            "the kind of action thriller that is rarely made today-one that emphasizes intellect and logic, intuition and political maneuvering over might and brawn",
            "The Hunt for Red October is a happy cinematic event, the first motion picture that allows us to experience the sweaty-palm thrills of the Cold War without worrying that the world will blow up this year.",
            "Based on Tom Clancy`s phenomenally successful techno-thriller novel, The Hunt for Red October proves that a film can equal, if not surpass, the intrigue and excitement of the story it is based on.",
            "Like the nuclear submarine it's named after, The Hunt for Red October is big, shiny, and expensive. But it's also hard, cold, and cumbersome, just when it's trying hardest to be likable and even friendly.",
            "This is first-rate adventure stuff, an all-missions-accomplished submarine movie. ",
            "The Hunt for Red October is overplotted and sometimes implausible, but McTiernan's clipped style and lavish budget help it through the choppier waters.",
            "The big question hanging over the much-anticipated film version of novelist Tom Clancy's best-seller The Hunt for Red October is how, in the current world climate,this cold war thriller will stand up to the warm glow of glasnost. The answer is: just fine.",
            "[McTiernan's] alternation of menace and human interest, technological wizardry and action sequences is subtly calibrated, ultimately hypnotic in its effect.",
            "It picks up some steam and we get what we came for: air-sea stunts, underwater effects, hunters closing in on the prey, a saboteur doing his stuff, lethal weapons and a few twisteroos.",
            "The talented supporting cast gives a pleasing sheen to the material, while John McTiernan's no-frills direction ensures that the tension rarely slips below pressure-cooker level.",
            "In spite of the high level of talent on board and at the helm, The Hunt for Red October is a heavy-duty mediocrity, sluggish, unwieldy, and instantly forgettable.",
            "The film mechanically uses the crosscutting technique made famous by Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove without any of its wit or focused energy.",
            "The Hunt for Red October is a lot better than you may suspect.",
            "One of Hollywood's better glossy, big-budget thrillers, delivering a solid chunk of tension spiced with occasional frantic action sequences.",
            "It is Sean Connery who really makes this movie work for me."

            "Stillman sketches his characters with gentle humor, capturing not only their foibles and foolishnesses but the earnest intentions behind them.",
            "Stillman hasn't made as hermetically appealing a movie since, but for those lamenting the absence of the written word in modern comedy - rather than the improvisationally blurted-out kind - \"Metropolitan\" makes for delightful memory-lane viewing.",
            "Metropolitan has always felt like a movie that exists in a strange, insular little bubble of its own, utterly divorced from the personal experience of virtually anyone who watches it.",
            "It might make you long for a return to movies in which teens have a greater vocabulary than their parents.",
            "Stillman films these rounds of romance and jealousy, old mind-sets and new friendships, as scintillating dialectical jousts in which verbal blows take the place of action and leave lasting emotional wounds.",
            "Whit Stillman's crafty independent feature about wealthy Park Avenue teenagers and a middle-class boy who joins their ranks over one Christmas vacation is certainly well imagined, and impressively acted by a cast of newcomers.",
            "Metropolitan introduced us to an intriguing new cinematic voice in Whit Stillman, and it stands as an utterly unique and highbrow example of the kind of cinema that's increasingly harder to find. ",
            "It's as though the world of F Scott Fitzgerald has been caught in a time warp, complete with a social interloper.",
            "Metropolitan is a melancholic lament for not-quite-doomed youth-a self-styled new \"lost generation\" that isn't really lost, but might just never have a purpose.",
            "Though the ensemble, on the whole, seem a scotch older than the characters they're playing, there's a fidelity in their Awkward Age emotional peculiarities that makes them absolutely convincing.",
            "Overall I enjoyed Metropolitan and I think the script by Whit Stilman is outstanding.",
            "It is difficult to describe it without making it sound precious -- but in fact it is fresh, funny and very appealing.",
            "Whit Stillman's directorial debut is a terrifically satirical portrayal of the upper echelons of New York society.",
            "Whit Stillman's \"urban haute bourgeoisie\" are redeemed because the filmmaker takes custody of them, their idiosyncrasies, their flaws.",
            "You get the feeling that you're eavesdropping on real conversation rather than the polite chit-chat you might expect at actual events, and seeing those aristocratic tendencies fall away to reveal scared human beings is part of the movie's infinite charm.",
            "Stillman's script is so present at every moment that it's easy to overlook how precisely the film has been directed.",
            "Unusual subject matter handled with competent self-assurance.",
            "A witty, urbane portrait of Manhattan's debutante scene.",
            "As low-budget as the film looks, Stillman overcomes financial limitations by providing a learned script and eliciting polished performances.",
            "It's wearing surprisingly well, yet is touchingly dated.",
            "It's the beautifully chiselled dialogue -- counterpointed by near-static camerawork and a nicely mannered acting style -- that remains the chief attraction.",
            "Filmmaker Whit Stillman makes a strikingly original debut with Metropolitan, a glib, ironic portrait of the vulnerable young heirs to Manhattan's disappearing debutante scene.",
            "Stillman's film depends on strong dialogue and language, his humor is submerged in the text and is played deadpan by his actors; no wonder some critics have compared him to the Gallic Eric Rohmer",
            "None of Stillman's endearing characters quite fits their prescribed social context, and in its exhilarated final movement, Metropolitan finds an exit out of the stifling UHB salon."

            "Walter Hill, who also directed the first film, surely recognizes the hollowness of what he's doing here. He also hasn't had a hit since \"48 HRS.,\" which no doubt explains why he's once again tilling these charred fields.",
            "The key words here are lazy and contrived.",
            "Mr. Murphy has two comic moments, which aren't enough for a feature-length film. Among other things, he has developed some of the same maddening mannerisms that marked Frank Sinatra's performances in his Rat Pack movies.",
            "Hill and his stars are merely going through the motions, but the motions are immensely familiar.",
            "The reason for bringing the odd-couple, buddy-cop combo back together again isn't particularly clever, though their chemistry is almost as amusing as it was before.",
            "Although original stars Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte are reunited with director Walter Hill, all three seem to be going through the motions here.",
            "The idea of dropping in on Reggie Hammond and Jack Cates five years later presents some amusing and intriguing possibilities. But little thought or imagination have been devoted to considering how the two characters might have changed over the years.",
            "Not a career high for anyone involved, rarely has 90-odd minutes felt more like 48 hours.",
            "From start to finish, the picture is barely alive, staggering through a cardboard obstacle course while waving around a few guns and breasts to keep the audience awake.",

            "The movie, a heady thicket of political intrigue and double crosses, is slower, talkier, and more prosaic than the first two films, and its narrative seams sometimes show. And yet it's more than the sum of its mazelike convolutions.",
            "The Godfather Part III matches its predecessors in narrative intensity, epic scope, socio-political analysis, physical beauty and deep feeling for its characters and milieu.",
            "Represents a certain moral improvement over its predecessors by refusing to celebrate and condemn violence and duplicity in the same breath, or at least to the same degree.",
            "The acting is merely passable, several characters are given nothing to do, and Michael's paranoid self-pity lends the film an absurd morality: Coppola expects us to sympathise with the semblance of virtue.",
            "Sofia Coppola, making a horrendous leading-role debut, is perhaps the single most significant reason why this film was not nearly as well received as the previous two entries.",
            "Countless set-pieces, both intimate and explosively violent, build intoxicating tension.",
            "That The Godfather, Part III works up any grandeur at all is a tribute to the luridly baroque plotting of Coppola and Mario Puzo and the fierce and apparently ineradicable residue of artistic honor still left inside Coppola.",
            "The movie has received an unfair amount of at times very petty criticism for the unspeakable crime of being a worse film two of the most highly-regarded American films ever made.",
            " [...] a crushing disappointment. It's a sluggish movie with nothing to say about the moral rot of the powerful that the first two parts didn't say much better [...]",
            "The third (and final) chapter of Coppola's epic crima saga is the weakest in terms of narrative and acting, but it still has artistic merits.",
            "The third and final Godfather saga; not for kids.",
            "This hits have gotten bigger, and the violence has gotten bloodier. It's less of an examination of family and more of a character piece for Michael.",
            "While it's better than your average film in a lot of respects, it simply cannot hold up to the legacy of its predecessors.",
            "...didn't live up to expectations but turned out to be a pretty good movie in any case.",
            "Considering the way it inadvertently lampoons and nearly diminishes the earlier two films, this is nothing less than a travesty.",
            "An epic without epic scope, a muted, strained, unnatural affair that never comes into dramatic focus.",
            "Indeed the disappointment many of its detractors assert it to be - in the same way that some of Orson Welles' subsequent works can be called disappointments when compared to Citizen Kane.",
            "Very few have stepped up to bat to defend The Godfather Part III (1990), which I consider a masterpiece and the equal of Parts I and II.",

            "Rocky loses his fortune, moves back to the old neighborhood and neglects his son while training an ultimately ungrateful young boxer. A manufactured attempt to capture the spirit of the original. What's intended as high drama is cloying and silly."

            "One-of-a-kind fairytale for adults from director Tim Burton. ",
            "Watching the film is like turning the pages of a small child's book which has very pretty pictures and two lines of large print spelling out the story.",
            "With Burton's surreal illustrative ingenuity, Depp and Ryder's career-making performances, and a story filled with simplicity, complexity, and intangible wizardry that stands the test of time, Edward Scissorhands is one of the greatest films ever made.",
            "Depp cuts a haunting figure, while Wiest is typically excellent. The rest of the actors are forced to play characters who are either underdeveloped or overcooked, and the broadness of Burton's approach eventually leads to a wholly unsatisfying resolution.",
            "Between this masterpiece and that other Ed (Wood), TIm Burton and Johnny Depp are at their dual-career best. Ed Wood is about how insane Hollywood is -- and Edward Scissorhands delivers the pure magic that, once in a rare while, escapes the place.",
            "...perhaps the cinema's most enchanting parable about the misunderstood and alienated artist.",
            "... this sweet 1990 fantasy ... for the first time crystallized the latent themes in the director's work: the notion of the artist as outsider, of skills that make one special but at the same time different.",
            "Fine performances all around, particularly from Depp and the immensely sympathetic Wiest.",
            "Visually, stylistically and emotionally stunning.",
            "It's visually pleasing and an easy film to like, even if it never gets out of shallow water as far as its story goes.",
            "[Burton and Depp] seem to bring out the best in each other.",
            "Burton's movies are fairytales for retarding evolution.",
            "His gothic tones always mask a feeling of wonder and an endearing love for everything that is possible in life and death",
            "Burton's sweet Gothic fairy tale has lost none of its charm.",
            "Johnny Depp and Tim Burton in magical collaboration.",
            "A personal film for Tim Burton, which also serves as a parable about the artist as an outsider, this lovely fairytale began the long, fruitful collaboration with the endlessly versatile Johnny Depp."

            "Burnett and his cast tap depths of mystery, soulfulness, and glee.",

            "It's a very entertaining, complex film, a comedy of unusual substance that also manages to keep the audience in suspense as to when the comedy might dissolve into some kind of vicious melodrama.",
            "This stately, stagey, funereally paced contemporary drama of middle-class African-American life looks as if it could have been set almost any time in the past half-century.",
            "An impressive, high-profile indie feature from Burnett, To Sleep with Anger stands on par with his seminal Killer of Sheep and oft unexplored resentments sometimes barely contained.",
            "an exemplary drama that reveals more and more narrative, emotional, and thematic layers each time you see it",
            "A strange film which I think would reward rewatching.",
            "Burnett employs a lyrical shooting style that aptly fits the material.",

            "Subtle and quietly powerful - partly novelistic, partly poetic",
            "Charles Burnett bridges theatrical dialogue, portentous omens, and presentational acting with masterful grace.",
            "If Killer of Sheep is Burnett's masterpiece, this film, an odd combination of drama, comedy, and irony, well-acted by Danny Glover, is his most accessible picture.",
            "An odd little movie -- and a bit too leisurely paced -- that was largely overlooked on its original release.",
            "A poetic and consistently surprising comedy-drama that is clearly a pet project for all its participants.",
            "Probes the value clashes in a middle-class Los Angeles black family",

            "The movie is quite enjoyable as long as it explores the fantasy of a neglected little boy having an entire house of his own to explore and play in, and it still manages to be fun when he exhibits superhuman ingenuity and resourcefulness.",
            "Pic boasts wonderful casting, with Culkin a delight as funny, resilient Kevin, and O'Hara bringing a snappy, zesty energy to the role of mom.",
            "A lot of people love Home Alone around the holidays but I love Home Alone year round.",
            "Home Alone has a premise that over the years became classic and an execution that was endearing from the beginning. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "The charisma of Macaulay Culkin matched with the intelligent script by John Hughes makes this the definitive holiday story that it is, appealing to all ages. ",

            "A hit for its slapstick humor as well as the age-old theme of a kid who bests the grown-ups.",
            "Its endearing story and a charming performance by Culkin make Home Alone a standout among the usual holiday movie fare.",
            "Two decades after it dominated the international box office, the idea continues to carry an almost parasitic charm, as if the underlying subtext of young Kevin's antics are like devices of adamant rebellion that refuse to fade quietly into the night.",
            "A better director could have helped the film out considerably, even saved it... But even then, the script is tremendously weak, by Hughes's standards or anybody else's.",
            "The only really likable thing about this film is Culkin. He's an uncommonly natural child actor, but even he doesn't always survive the tiresome gags (the aftershave bit is funny once; three times is tedious). ",
            "This is engaging and frequently hilarious. But the joke is stretched a bit too far.",
            "A hilarious comedy (although not a very believable one -- there can be no eight-year-olds this ingenious) that kids will love and adults won't mind sitting through either.",
            "A funny, but overrated family comedy",
            "There are few movies that can be described as never having a dull moment, and Home Alone fits in this small group. It's the perfect family holiday film.",
            "A lot of Hughes' hooray-for-suburban-misfits sensibility survives the milling process.",
            "watching this all again today with a critical eye reveals that Home Alone's prat-fall humor has gotten completely worn out",
            "[The movie has] an inconsistency of mood not helped by abrupt editing and Columbus' sometimes self-conscious direction."

            "[Director John McNaughton] shows few of Henry's dozen or so crimes. Instead he reveals the victims, at the scenes of their deaths, in slow zoom shots accompanied by elegiac music. He is a coroner with a touch of the poet.",
            "In a world in which eight nearly identical Friday the 13th movies offer the adventures of Jason the ax-murderer as entertainment for teen-agers, maybe we do need this sobering alternative.",
            "The film is an honest and disturbing attempt to come to grips with the sort of modern horror that we must -- more urgently every day -- try to understand.",
            "The difference between John McNaughton's incredibly chilling film and the usual serving of screen carnage is the difference between the mind of a murderer and the cynical and manipulative depiction of mindless murder.",
            "Sure, it's compelling; the nature of the material guarantees that. But it doesn't seem to be telling us much more than that the world is a scary place and murder is ugly. We knew those things. This is tabloid chic.",
            "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer is as fine a film as it is a brutally disturbing one.",
            "Combining raw realism and commentary on violent media, McNaughton closes the gap between fictional slasher horror.",
            "A disturbing, realistic film loosely based on Henry Lee Lucas that also questions our relationship to violence in media. One of the best horrors of the 1980s.",
            "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer has a creepy, city-after-dark overtone, an existential chill. It carries a true grindhouse whiff while staking its claim as art.",
            "It is unspeakably unpleasant, and it is almost perfect.",
            "The director's artistry overshadows his grind house titillations, though they're still to be found aplenty...not just grim and gross or even disturbing; it's hurtful.",
            "It resonates with nightmarish energies, as if possessed by a malevolent quality that keeps its subject matter piercing in this era of violent saturation.",
            "A powerful, original look at the hopeless urban underclass in the American city, where lost people nibble at the garbage of our culture -- in a kind of perverse application of the \"trickle-down\" theory -- hating themselves and us all the while.",
            "If you want a gore fix, this is it. If you're looking for a film with purpose, better wait until the bill changes.",
            "McNaughton's rough, non-judgemental direction gives the film a stylishly chilling documentary feel, while the killer's use of a camcorder asks some challengingly uncomfortable questions about voyeurism and the nature of screen violence.",
            "John McNaughton's direction has flashes of cinematic brilliance, but there's a disturbing lack of purpose to its clinically told and horrifyingly violent tale.",
            "A drama of vivid intensity, it has all the marks of a well-made, thoughtful film that does not exploit violence for its own sake or make killing a source of entertainment.",
            "This movie is not really about a killer, but about killing -- the way killing is depicted in the movies and the way movie audiences have been conditioned to react to such violence.",
            "McNaughton's direction combines a strict social realism with a cool, Fritz Langian sense of pre-determination, while his work with actors has the improvisational freshness of a John Cassavetes.",
            "The film is diabolically driven by Michael Rooker, who embodies the fractured, disconnected personality of Henry.",
            "The flipside of the '80s teen slasher genre, John McNaughton's movie manages to go beyond the disquieting, distressing or even disturbing. It's downright dismaying.",
            "From a technical standpoint, Henry is amateurish. But ultimately it's not the gilded frame that made it a modern horror classic, but its unblinking portrait of a remorseless killer who stares back at the audience and forces them to turn away.",
            "McNaughton, co-writer Richard Fire and Rooker have pulled off an amazing feat -- a portrait of a damaged mind that refuses to explain, judge or glamorize psychopathic violence.",
            "This is sicko territory with a vengeance but certainly has an impact."

            "Boasting a prettified brutality that rivals that of 300, Pathfinder also explores a similar theme, the manly pursuit of revenge at any cost.",

            "'90s thriller about near-death experiences is very violent. ",

            "Young medical students intentionally kill and resuscitate each other, thereby gaining knowledge of the afterlife, which turns out to look a lot like... MTV.",
            "The death trips are part travelogue, part bad dream, and they quickly start to pall with the same scene basically being repeated five times.",
            "The look is overpowering enough to delay -- though not forever -- examination of the plot, which has to pull a fast one at every turn to keep moving and which eventually makes a mockery of plausibility.",
            "Released shortly after the huge commercial success that was Ghost, this is a little like an overlong episode of the The Twilight Zone.",
            "An intoxicating, smoky triumph, highlighting the helmer as a visual maniac who once made gloriously strange genre movies for a strange audience.",
            "A cautionary tale that ends along fairly traditional horror-sci-fi lines, Flatliners is a strikingly original, often brilliantly visualized film from director Joel Schumacher and writer Peter Filardi.",
            "We're in mystical territory here, hence the flamboyant visuals; but that's no excuse for Peter Filardi's affected script."

            "Reiner's tense adaptation of Stephen King's first satisfying screen yarn in years is superbly paced, chock full of devilish plot twists and capable of lifting audiences inches off their seats.",

            "Director Rob Reiner creates an atmosphere of tense horror wrapped around rich dialogue (\"Cockadoodie dirty birdie!\"), and in the process, he gets sterling performances from Caan and Bates.",
            "Kathy Bates brilliantly portrays Annie as someone with absolutely no sense of her own monstrosity.",
            "Except for the flat, compromised ending, Reiner's smooth direction and Goldman's nicely structured script make this version of King's novella enjoyable as a horror flick and psychological thriller, not to mention Kathy Bates' superb turn as the wacko fan",
            "The dark duet between Paul and the frankly psychopathic Annie is played to tense perfection."

            "Preys upon that dread in a wonderfully cinematic manner, elegantly keeping the antics lighthearted enough to encourage a viewing, but eventually digging into spiderific panic -- pure candy to horror junkies on the prowl for the perfect thrill.",
            "Plenty of laughs, but the action scenes don't really generate much in the way of scares. Good enough for Sunday afternoon, though.",
            "Spider terror -- overproduced and effects-driven, but adequate."

            "Darkman sustains mild interest throughout, but it never takes off, partly because a real-estate scam, gangland shootouts, city corruption and a love story clutter up the sad story of Westlake's strange mutation.",

            "It's a fun, gruesome, and original revenge picture for horror and pulp fans alike...",
            "As with most of Raimi's early work, the second-hand premise is an excuse for the director's movie-mad visual invention.",
            "Darkman is funny, but it's no joke; it's the work of a man who underlines the conventions of adventure stories and horror because he enjoys them, and knows that even when rendered tongue-in-cheek, they're timeless.",
            "Truly the overall film is quite good, but the audience will likely be moved to unintended laughter on occasion and the film is sometimes too surreally silly to truly feel as \"dark\" as Darkman. ",

            "Raimi's $14-million project is a thrilling comic-book-style adventure that goes for the heart but uses romance and tragedy in lieu of an eight-inch blade.",
            "Darkman remains a powerful picture, isolating a pitch of superhero sadness while amplifying the rest with a comforting church-bell clang of violence. A sly Bruce Campbell cameo is merely icing on the cake."

            "It's all fairly unconvincing - but its heart is roughly in the right place.",
            "This is old-fashioned, assembly-line moviemaking without the old panache.",
            "An unequalled exercise in modern, mature romance, which would garner Roberts a Best Actress Academy Award nomination and a lengthy streak of box office stardom.",
            "Pretty Woman is packed with guilty pleasures. It's a fresh, beguiling bottom-drawer Pygmalian that entertains despite its worn premise.",
            "Originally meant to be a serious drama (called $3,000) about a man buying a prostitute for the night, this turned into a delightful romantic comedy in the hands of director Garry Marshall and sent the career of star Julia Roberts into the stratosphere.",
            "Despite its cornball attributes-maybe because of them-this is a sweetheart of an old-fashioned romantic comedy.",
            "But in the end, what's most ridiculous about the film isn't the lack of realism.",
            "The message is plain: Men, especially rich men, have all the power. So be sure to do what they tell you, and maybe they'll treat you nicely.",
            "Between a woman who sells her body and a man who sells shares there is no difference: There was no greater example of postmodernity than this. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "The soundtrack, including the Roy Orbison classic that gave the movie its name, is bopping, and the pacing is breezy. Gere is charismatic, and he and Roberts have a subtle chemistry, a complicity that you want to share.",
            "Uneven film that is not as good as the public thought at the time.",
            "The movie is a fairy tale, more about American consumerism than a reformed prostitute, but it's worth seeing for Julia Roberts charismatic performance.",
            "Takes the Disney princess and puts her in the real world, creating a chick flick with a little bit of edge, a whole lot of heart and and even more chemistry between the film's two leads.",
            "Believing in love is swell and all, but maybe we're better off not buying the brand Pretty Woman is selling. [Blu-ray]",
            "The movie itself, a modern update of the Cinderella story, is as contrived as you get--isn't that not-so-secretly what we want?--but at no point is Roberts' performance",
            "Against all odds, the presence of the incomparable Julia Roberts makes this a damn enjoyable career-defining film for Garry Marshall, and a guilty pleasure for movie lovers.",
            "Gere and Roberts do good work, but this feelgood fantasy is laced with some preposterous messages about love, success and money.",
            "Pic's casting is astute, with Gere underplaying like a sturdy ballet star who hoists the ballerina Roberts on his shoulders.",
            "Bound to offend prostitutes and millionaires everywhere, this flick is not the street-smart Pygmalion it desperately wants to be.",
            "Low on real social comment, this modern fable still has more than enough chemistry between its leading pair to rake in the box-office rewards."

            "Complex, volatile, ironic and disquieting, Scorsese's Goodfellas is a masterly achievement in intense observation.",
            "Is it a great movie? I don't think so. But it's a triumphant piece of filmmaking-journalism presented with the brio of drama.",
            "Anti-romantic, it nevertheless sweeps us into the allure of mob glamour -- then slams us with its cost of admission.",
            "Robert De Niro is reliably dynamic, and Joe Pesci's portrait of a gangster with a sense of humour is hideously memorable, but there's no doubt that GoodFellas fights a losing battle against numbness.",
            "Goodfellas is a terrifying film because, like much of Scorsese's best work, it is about the lives of avuncular psychopaths, and pretty-boy Liotta brilliantly encapsulates that fetid contradiction.",
            "Brash and brilliant ...",
            "GoodFellas feels to me like the movie Scorsese was put here to make. And he made it accordingly.",
            "I've never seen a movie with such swagger. When you watch it you feel like you're getting away with something.",
            "From the soundtrack to the dialogue to the brutal violence, everything is coated in humor - an uncommon but wry style to impart on a movie with such serious themes.",
            "Henry Hill's love song to his life in a Mafia family.",
            "It's got a sharp script and good performances all around, which makes it very entertaining.",
            "\"The movie's morality lies in its form.\"",
            "It's probably the manic air and the sense that what we're really watching is a black comedy that transmits the most.",
            "The dialogue is as wonderful as it is profane. The performances are as down-to-earth and familiar as they are superlative achievements in screen acting. The movie is so densely textured, you can almost smell the gravy cooking on the stove in the kitchen.",
            "Scorsese's barely fictionalized adaptation of Hill's memoir captures the charge of being a mobster on New York in the sixties and seventies without glorifying the behavior by keying into Hill's willfully self-deluded perspective. ",
            "The best movie about who gangsters are, and how they came to exert such a magnetic pull on American culture.",
            "A fascinating, intelligent, and in some ways groundbreaking movie.",
            "It's a film full of thrilling entertainment: a juicy, wry and relentless account of a garish way of life.",
            "For its swaggering energy, the heart-in-your-throat pacing and for some of the most memorable, most imitated scenes in mafia movie history, this must rank as one of Scorsese's finest films, if not the best.",
            "This is Scorsese at the very height of his powers, orchestrating storytelling with a dynamic urgency and a bravura use of camera, music and outstanding performers.",
            "The rock 'n' roll counterpoint to the grand operatic tragedy of Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather saga.",
            "Goodfellas is remorseless, its message terminally bleak.",
            "It hasn't aged in the slightest.",
            "Sure, it's a rush - but is that enough? "

            "[It's] fast-moving, never dull, extremely funny, and manages to touch, with lighthearted (and R-rated) profundity on almost every youthful issue you can imagine, including police harassment, teenage sex, the all-too-easy road to jail and alcohol drinking.",
            "House Party isn't a great movie, but it's heartfelt and enormously winning.",
            "Such a classic movie on so many levels, very well-written and it holds up really well.",
            "Really fun, not too long, and I enjoyed myself as it kept going. Scenes with cops resonate today...",
            "'90 hip-hop comedy marred by gay slurs. Lots of cursing. ",
            "One's enjoyment of House Party, I suspect, will be largely dictated by one's tolerance of teenage energy. Because there's not much else going on in this amiable, but overlong and under-plotted movie.",
            "An energetic and hilarious party film with charming stars, a killer soundtrack, and some great moments...",
            "This is a feel-good no-brainer with a party-loving cast and flat-top hairdos you could play pool on.",
            "Crude and cartoony but hypnotic in its infectious energy, this low-budget comedy about a night in the lives of some black teenagers is an auspicious debut from brothers Reginald (directing) and Warrington (producing) Hudlin.",
            "The first--and best--of the three black comedies made of the same concept, this joyful picture was far less cloying than its white counterpart movies of the 1960s.",
            "What is most appealing about House Party, and what sets it apart from many movies in the same genre, is that there is an energy and exuberance, a joy of living being celebrated here that is absolutely infectious.",

            "It's weird and surreal, but it ends with most of the holes plugged and all but a few of the loose ends tied into a tidy package. Some argue this is a cheat and the film should have been more open ended. That's a personal choice; I like it the way it is.",
            "For hours and days after you've seen it, you'll still be putting it together in your head. While all of it is gripping, it doesn't come together until the final scene, which is jolting, transcendent, unexpected yet inevitable.",
            "As long as the movie refuses to commit itself, it is a truly creepy, nerve-jangling experience.",
            "In the best puzzle movies, the pieces fit -- eventually. But if you try to piece together Jacob's Ladder, all you get for your trouble is more pieces.",
            "Without a strongly sympathetic figure at the center of the movie, Jacob's plight seems very remote. Watching this film should feel like being caught in a nightmare, but it feels more like watching someone else who is caught in a nightmare.",
            "[Robbins' and Pena's] scenes together are the highlight of the film, so natural, so bright. That's why we're willing to invest a lot of time in what turns out to be a terribly overwrought plot.",
            "It's just as haunting as I remember.",
            "Jacob's Ladder wrestles with our fear of death, the power of our dreams, and the presence of angels (or are they demons?) in our lives.",
            "It is this constant slippage into uncertainty that makes Jacob's Ladder unique. Lyne's focus on the sensual experiences of his character helps blur that line between dream and reality...",
            "Though [Lyne] arguably focuses more on the thriller elements than the existential ones, he still manages a seductive, nightmare-like quality.",
            "'90s drama about Vietnam vet has language, violence. ",
            "Jacob's Ladder is unique. Rarely is such an unconventional screenplay given this full-blown, $25 million studio treatment. It is a curiosity -- a mutant of a movie in an industry that specializes in clones.",
            "One of Robbins' finest unheralded performances, plus a slew of supporting roles from then-unknowns Eriq LaSalle, Ving Rhames, Jason Alexander, Pruitt Taylor Vince, and an uncredited Macaulay Culkin.",
            "There's a word for a movie that dresses up the usual cheap tricks with real human suffering and a bogus patina of truth: offensive.",
            "Every story needs some kernel of internal logic, some hold on reality. But Lyne's film is like trying to scale a mountain of Jello. There's no solid ground. Everything is constantly shifting and undulating.",
            "Just when it's on the brink of becoming one of the most disturbing, disorienting and penetrating psychological horror movies, Jacob's Ladder -- in a self-deflating few minutes -- turns itself into a shaggy-dog story. ",
            "A friend, after seeing Jacob's Ladder, griped, \"I wasn't afraid of dying -- until I saw this movie.\" Put that blurb in an ad and see who shows up at the multiplexes.",
            "Despite its frequently maddening lapses in logic and time frame, Jacob`s Ladder transcends most script ills to become a haunting and truly chilling thriller-melodrama.",
            "Jacob's Ladder takes a long time getting to the point, and when it does, there isn't that much to it.",
            "Tim Robbins gives a strong performance in this first-class horror yarn, which has a surprisingly strong political edge.",
            "Jacob's Ladder only belongs to the horror genre insofar as it understands these conventions well enough to simultaneously borrow from and transcend them. In the process, it becomes something else altogether. ",
            "Jacob's Ladder is the nightmare as Rube Goldberg machine. Lyne bombards us with omens and portents, but they aren't rooted in anything, and so the audience remains in a state of arbitrary, floating anxiety.",
            "worthwhile journey--just didn't blow me away",
            "Unfairly dismissed on its original release, this really deserves to be better known: the ultimate example of bad-trip mainstream cinema."

            "Total Recall is slick, sly and subversive, and if some of the special effects have aged somewhat, that only adds to the charm.",
            "As Quaid, Schwarzenegger continues to stretch beyond his reach as an actor, relying on physical prowess to keep him in character.",

            "Total Recall went through four directors before Verhoeven finally took it on, and four writers worked on the script. It's no wonder the finished film emerges without a unifying style, or a single performance worth mentioning.",
            "This rip-roaring slice of sci-fi excess remains Arnold Schwarzenegger's most satisfying film since his breakthrough hit, The Terminator.",
            "If the movie sometimes seems overwhelmed by its budget and its legendary third-act problems, it's still entertainingly raw and brutal, full of whiplash pace and juicy exaggeration.",
            "If Total Recall isn't as much fun as I'd hoped, it's not as dreary as I'd feared. I wouldn't call it totally awesome, but it's far from being a total loss.",
            "The movie is a cartoon, though a mammothly enjoyable one.",
            "Arnold Schwarzenegger brings an effective blend of machismo and innocence to his role. Too bad director Paul Verhoeven lets brainless violence and tricky special effects swamp the cleverness of the tale itself.",
            "Total Recall begins to self-destruct not long after Schwarzenegger arrives on Mars, and the story degenerates into a violent, stunningly foul-mouthed enterprise.",
            "If you don't ask too many questions, or just accept that it's all a dream so logic and science don't matter, then this is an enjoyable romp.",
            "Paul Verhoeven's version of the original story packs a real sense of intellect and brilliant ambiguity beneath the seemingly surface science fiction action tale...",
            "A wickedly violent, action-packed old school piece of warped, twist-filled sci-fi and Schwarzenegger cheese. You'll wish you had three hands to hold this one.",
            "Minor Verhoeven, well-above-average Schwarzenegger, and as well-made as any action movie from around the turn of the 1990s you could name.",
            "Total Recall's caricaturing of Schwarzenegger, its flip ribbing at his stocks of action-hero cache, signal the deep, almost atomic level at which its satire functions. ",
            "When the leader of the rebels turns out to be Baby Herman from Who Framed Roger Rabbit, it's clear that the satirical bull's-eyes Verhoeven nailed in RoboCop have here been turned into a more benign state of rib-nudging.",
            "It's not a masterpiece, but it is a fast-moving thriller, one worth revisiting (and, evidently, remaking)."

            "Just when you've had it with the mistimed scenes and the clunky direction, writer-director Andrew Bergman comes through with an inspired piece of lunacy.",
            "It's the kind of material that could easily fly apart into silliness, yet Brando and Broderick help the director to keep it anchored in a certain emotional reality, which is always the source of the richest comedy.",
            "Marlon Brando returns to the movies with one of his funniest performances as, in essence, Don Corleone with a screw loose.",
            "Marlon Brando delivers six-minute sonatinas of send-up and sincerity. He keeps things light but also from tilting over into something ephemerally broad like, say, \"Mickey Blue Eyes,\"a perfectly enjoyable comedy but a piffle next to this perfection.",
            "Bruno Kirby provides an added shot as Brando's wiseguy right-hand man, and Paul Benedict practically steals the film as the over-opinionated film prof.",

            "Here's a chance to see a mellow Marlon Brando in his greatest comedy performance.",
            "The Freshman has dead spots, certainly, but makes up for them with its moments of inspired craziness.",
            "In the case of this inspired comedy, the plot is a dignified bonkers combination of The Graduate, The Sting, The Godfather and The Producers.",
            "It's fun to watch Marlon Brando parody one of his most justly celebrated roles.",
            "An underrated hidden treasure.",
            "No film offering the spectacle of a Komodo dragon being transported across a state line for immoral purposes can be lightly dismissed.",
            "It's a nice premise, film informing life, and Bergman's film succeeds thanks to its sprightly pace, modest but fully realised ambition and the ever affable Broderick.",
            "Marlon Brando's sublime comedy performance elevates The Freshman from screwball comedy to a quirky niche in film history.",
            "The Freshman has a preposterous plot even the writer's mother couldn't believe, and it strains and creaks down the runway, but when this baby gets off the ground, we're talking seriously funny. ",

            "A truly genial and delightful comedy.",

            "Back to the Future Part III is an infinitely better picture than its predecessor. It's more coherent and streamlined. That's surprising, since parts II and III were filmed at the same time.",
            "The inimitable Fox is again on cracking form as Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd's romance with Mary Steenburgen is surprisingly touching.",
            "It is a silly movie but I enjoy it and find it entertaining.",

            "Wild West-themed final installment is fine for older tweens.",
            "avoids many of the previous sequel's narrative and logical pitfalls and reengages more successfully with the simple, direct pleasures that made the 1985 original such a hit",

            "A fitting end to one of the most enjoyable fantasy series of the 1980s.",

            "The filmmakers know the audience is challenging them to top themselves, and they've risen to the bait. Harlin and company build suspense the old-fashioned way. They earn it.",
            "This is the most cheerfully preposterous film of a jaw-dropping summer, which is not to say it's not fun, it's simply orchestrated Looney Tunes.",
            "The summer's best sequel and most satisfying blockbuster has finally arrived. Die Hard 2 is a blast.",
            "Even when the script wanders into cynical overkill, Harlin makes sure the violence has some impact, some moral consequence, by sketching in characters for a few representative victims.",
            "The filmmakers seem to be operating under the assumption that the way you top a successful movie is by making one that's louder, cruder and more violent.",
            "The screenplay is precariously supported by the chips on John McClane's shoulders. Fortunately, it is also designed to Willis' unique specs.",
            "Packs plenty of punch, heavy-hitting adventure, and explosions galore.",
            "In a summer of wildly violent action films, 'Die Hard 2' stands out. It is the best action movie since 'Lethal Weapon II,' as vastly entertaining, exciting and improbable.",
            "Even in the action genre, there is such a thing as overkill. Die Hard 2: Die Harder pleads guilty to the charge but has enough redeeming plot twists to compensate for the excess.",
            "Though it has an inventive and unexpected plot twist, Die Hard 2 lacks credibility. \"Die Hard\" was that rare modern action picture with a wholly believable plot.",
            "One might think a movie with a reported budget of $62 million would have had a few bucks to spend on a gaffe spotter.",
            "As vapid as it is violent.",
            "Die Hard 2 delivers everything you'd expect from the title's promise. Trouble is, Die Hard 2 really didn't need to wallow in graphic violence to be a good, engaging picture.",
            "Bruce Willis wonders aloud how it could happen to him again, but dons the white singlet anyway for this second hugely entertaining slice of action hokum.",
            "As long as Willis is in his vest and playing McClane, it's hard to care about its shortcomings.",
            "Willis confirms his status as one of the best action men around -- he can actually act.",
            "While this sequel may not rise to the heights of the classic first, it is still a damn fine flick with lots to love. ",
            "... Everything a good sequel should be.",
            "A number of scenes have been staged with satisfying kinetic flair, and Willis once again makes an appealing superhero. Yet without that great big booby-trapped skyscraper to hold the action together, the suspense dissipates.",
            "John McClane spreads vigilante Christmas cheer.",
            "Exquisite widescreen theatrics and explosive entertainment. It's an awesome machine of mayhem....a skilled sequel, a brass-knuckled bruiser of an action picture, and a sublime cinematic distraction.",
            "Die Hard 2 lacks the inventivenes of the original but compensates with relentless action.",
            "\"How can the same thing happen to the same guy twice?\" asks a bewildered and ultra-ironic John McClane. Well, make a film as successful as Die Hard and you'll soon find out.",
            "If your idea of a good time is watching a lot of stupid, unpleasant people insult and brutalize one another, this is right up your alley."

            "Centering on the career of a jazz musician (well played by Denzel Washington, just before he became a star), this mid-range picture has nice production values but the drama is too diffuse, lacking the edge of Spike Lee's more overtly political works.",
            "Spike Lee's film is filled with promising ideas and moments of technical virtuosity.",

            "Reduced to pure plot, the narrative is not so much a sendup of 1980s hypocrisy as an orgy of banal, juvenile mean-spiritedness. The irony of Wolfe's book becomes shrill, screaming sarcasm, unpleasant, and, worse, unfunny.",
            "In this heavy-handed and uneven treatment, De Palma drains Tom Wolfe's original story of its humour, and must shoulder the blame for its failure.",
            "Even as they've smoothed the novel's rough edges... the filmmakers have tried to cram a maximum number of its incidents into about two hours of screen time. This gives the picture a hectic pace that adds to its feeling of weightlessness and unreality.",

            "If anything, it's a Hanks 'little boy lost' movie, more in the Big tradition than The Big Tradition.",
            "An interesting failure that's not as bad as its reputation. Speaks a lot of truth, but the tone is too broad.",

            "TV might make cautionary stick figures of Claus and Sunny. Reversal of Fortune treats them as if they were Noel Coward lovers gone to hell in a Lamborghini.",
            "Irons' Von Bulow is easily the most attractive and entertaining movie heavy since James Mason`s villain in North by Northwest, a figure with whom he shares a taste for elegant homes and wry understatement.",
            "Screenwriter Nicholas Kazan, director Barbet Schroeder and, especially, Jeremy Irons--in a glittering performance as the divinely decadent Dane--have chosen to treat this social death spiral as a tragicomedy of manners. It's an inspired tone.",
            "The trial of Claus von Bulow has been turned into more of a rumination on the American criminal justice system with a strong focus on celebrity defense counsel.",
            "This brilliant and outrageously entertaining film is a meticulous reenactment of one of the great dark-side-of-the-privileged sagas of our time.",
            "It is a finely detailed manners study of the superwealthy, a drama of conflicting principles and values and an engrossing legal detective story.",
            "As distant and icy as Jeremy Irons' Oscar-winning performance as suspected murderer Claus von B\u00fclow, but like Irons' inscrutable steeliness, it's also endlessly compelling.",
            "Enormously entertaining.",
            "Despite Silver's great energy, what's missing from the picture are the kind of insights necessary to explain any of the film's characters, including himself, in human terms.",
            "Von Bulow is an enigma with a sense of humor, and that's exactly the way Irons plays him. Dershowitz is a man of exceptional cunning, and that's the way Silvers plays him. Their performances, and that of Close, will probably win Oscar nominations.",
            "Barbet Schroeder directed the ingeniously made film, which weaves fact, hypothesis, and conjecture into a harrowing yet continually gripping and often highly amusing narrative.",
            "Director Barbet Schroeder shoots The Great Gatsby-style setting with a documentary eye and gives the picture a deep sense of irony -- a quality enhanced by Irons's superb performance.",
            "A window on the world of the very rich, an exploration of the legal process and a story of a most corrupt marriage -- Reversal of Fortune is juicy fare.",
            "Though weak in several vital departments, the intricate structure of the film is so compellingly offbeat and the acting so overwhelmingly first-rate, that any reservations are eventually swept aside.",
            "It's a movie that outdoes the seamiest of soap operas. And it's all the more engaging because it's true.",
            "What a brilliant and unexpected and wickedly perverse movie this is.",
            "In Barbet Schroeder's spellbinding Reversal of Fortune, Jeremy Irons plays the pure incarnation of evil.",
            "Mixing reality and fiction, without using that mixture to produce any substantial addition to our knowledge, this movie at once goes too far and not far enough.",
            "In a more contemporary vein, Reversal of Fortune, the von Bulow story, combines inspired casting with a lethal dose of wit.",
            "Gripping drama.",
            "Director Schroeder takes the 'did-he didn't-he' conundrum surrounding Claus von B\u00fclow and makes it the film's greatest virtue, with Irons mesmerising.",
            "This is a movie rich in moral ambiguities and one which should thoroughly please voyeurs and detective story enthusiasts alike.",
            "What it all adds up to is something the film never quite seems prepared to address, but this is a fascinating look at all the secondary questions.",
            "In his black satire, Kazan and Schroeder go beyond issues of guilt and morality, exposing and contesting the stereotypes of an Odd Couple: Von Bulow as rich, arrogant Eurotrash who needs thw work of a bright, hardworking and sweaty Jewish laywer."

            "The movie's initial intensity is so great, it consumes itself.",
            "There is no denying the fun to be had with Wild at Heart. Its irresistibly charismatic leads draw you into Lynch's anything goes, 50s-inflected nightmare with an ease and insanity that's unlike anything put to film before or after.",
            "I don't think at all that 'Wild Heart' is one of the great works of David Lynch, but I must say it is a wildly entertaining road movie about love, passion and freedom. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Most of the time it's unquestionably disturbing, but every so often a hint of deeper meaning pokes through the strangeness.",
            "A non-stop fun-fest that doesn't have tried to be groovy, but goes to great pains to make sure things stay that way.",
            "Perhaps the major problem is that despite Cage and Dern's best efforts, Lynch is ultimately interested only in iconography, not characters at all.",
            "The scattergun nastiness is, after a while, profoundly unaffecting.",
            "Lynch brings forth a world where evil and weirdness coexist, the two being these obstacles that arise in the way of a romance unlike any other.",
            "There's a spontaneous, anything-can-happen feeling to it that's the primary appeal of any road movie.",
            "I enjoyed it more back in 1990, though I'd be hard-pressed to recall exactly why -- viewing it now, it's only a marginally satisfying experience, with some potent set-pieces diluted by an almost juvenile predilection on Lynch's part.",
            "A perverse, violent, nutso depiction of romance that even Bonnie and Clyde would shrug off as too hardcore for them. ",
            "Should be perceived as a wicked comedy.",
            "The result's mostly empty at heart and hollow on top.",
            "This winner of the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or is a lunatic road movie seething with the same dark intensity that animates director Lynch's earlier work.",
            "It's not a pleasant film by any definition, and it's not remotely for everyone, but it's true to Lynch's vision.",
            "Lynch's paean to Wizard of Oz divided critics when it premeiered at Cannes, and it never found an audience beyond the helmer's fans who enjoyed the fable's couple (Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern) taking their own Yellow Brick Road in search of the wizard",
            "Not for the weak of heart, one of the best Lynchian outings with some fantastically memorable dialogue."

            "The characters look like plastic dolls, and the story is recycled sci-fi.",

            "Though they are still identifiable by their color-coordinated masks and penchant for pizza, their character distinctions are harder to perceive in this revival.",
            "A passable brand rebooting exercise that will impress younger kids even if it doesn't satisfy older fans.",
            "What remains is intensely numbing action scenes, poor plot machinations and joyless character sketches all rendered in exquisitely cold CGI.",
            "Words cannot easily express how profoundly unrewarding it is to revisit the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.",
            "As a film, it's curious. It feels like an intermediary story.",
            "The Turtles still eat pizza, they still skateboard, and they're still totally badass.",
            "It's not quite as grown-up as it wants to be, but it's still a polished revival of a franchise that many thought long dead.",
            "Kids will undoubtedly want to check out these new improved Turtles . . . and a lot of parents will probably be glad to have, uh, shelled out the extra bucks to relive their own childhoods alongside them.",
            "Almost every good scene in TMNT is an action sequence and a lot of time and thought has been put into them. So much in fact that none seems to have been spared for the story or any of the other characters.",
            "The characters were no longer constrained by rubber suits or the laws of physics.",
            "The plot's all over the place, but director Kevin Munroe keeps it at a hare's pace. The sharp graphics impress too. It's nothing to cow about, but it does, more or less, fill its shell.",
            "The strongest ingredient remains the four reptiles' incorrigible charm, which easily outclasses a muddled storyline and concessions to the prepubescent male audience.",
            "This mediocre computer-generated action flick is packed full of monsters and sword-fights, but the story-telling is about as deft as a turtle turned on its back, struggling to get up but going nowhere fast.",
            "It won't convert the unfaithful but this messy, energetic action adventure is lurid fun, and may well re-ignite the popularity of the heroes in a half-shell.",
            "It was a great decision to animate this feature film. The great decisions end there. Unfortunately, TMNT doesn't spend nearly enough time having fun.",
            "Ageing fans of the originals with lowered expectations will have an okay-ish time.",
            "Turtle power returns in routine kiddie adventure.",
            "It's never, ever a good thing when the first trouble sign of a bad story comes in the opening scene.",
            "If none of this sounds particularly new or inventive, that's because it isn't. Darwin never said 'Cowabunga,' but he did know you evolve or you die.",

            "A treat.",

            "That balance of the ideal and the tragic weaves all throughout Cinema Paradiso, which is epic in terms of the time frame it covers, but feels consistently intimate",
            "Recent changes to cinema which have seen the projectionist's art sidelined in the digital age add a further layer of poignancy to the magical memories.",
