            "Where Newell really scores is in taking a leaf out of Peter Jackson's book and cranking up the fear factor.",
            "For those like me who are outside but sympathetic to the faith, it looks like another handsomely made, good-natured and high-spirited family movie, which is dramatically stymied through being locked within school grounds.",
            "Goblet is really just a glorified, 157-minute teaser trailer, an empty epic of proportions that truly stagger.",
            "In its last third, The Goblet of Fire builds to a climax of such overpowering dread that you might just forget the rest. Harry grows up in an instant, and the film does, too.",
            "Kloves has streamlined J. K. Rowling's 700-plus-page opus into cinematic fighting form. And the special effects, which threatened to overwhelm the first two movies, are seamlessly integrated.",
            "Goblet of Fire is more effective in these smaller, more intimate moments than in the bloated bombast of its larger set pieces.",
            "It's increasingly evident that seven books and as many as eight theatrical adaptations fuel the need for too much filler subplots or nonessential side characters.",
            "More precious than a Golden Snitch in a game of Quidditch, this is one of the Must See films of the year.",
            "Good film directed for a teenage audience in which not only is magic taught but also how stereotypes affect it while the film itself recreates some British stereotypes. [Review in Spanish]",
            "For the first time, the stakes of this battle of good and evil become painfully evident.",
            "It feels rushed and there are definitely the most plotholes in this entry in the series. Still, when it does work it really works.",
            "Goblet of Fire is great, very watchable and re-watchable.",
            "For the first time, adults might actually enjoy a Harry Potter film as much as children.",
            "The adolescent subplot is treated sweetly by Newell. The awkward dances and dating faux pas at the school ball feel like additions from some other, less mythic series, and form a welcome respite from the intense magic-making of the rest of the film.",
            "Much of the credit goes to Radcliffe and his co-stars, who have become better actors with each film. They have become increasingly adept at conveying great emotion as each film demands more of them.",
            "I think this is the best Potter film yet, for one simple reason: it's not like a Harry Potter film.",
            "The acting is stronger than ever in this fourth installment.",
            "By demonstrating to us how Harry and his friends are budding and changing and struggling, the film demonstrates the progressive richness of Rowling's storytelling skills and oddly haunting allure of her writing.",
            "All in all, Goblet of Fire is certainly the best Potter yet, with most of the cast doing their roles justice, some great direction and Steven Kloves' screenplay makes the core of Rowling's novel into a fast-paced but easily-comprehensible enjoyable movie.",
            "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is mostly satisfying, simply because such technical precision and meaningful special effects are rare in fantasy films today.",
            "This fourth segment of now-adolescent Harry Potter's story, while arguably the best made, is also the most gruesome, and dark.",
            "With its grand special effects, many small moments of charm, and continuing development of the characters, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire takes us into a world that, evil or not, makes us reluctant to leave.",
            "Newell vividly conjures up a world fraught with real danger.",
            "As young wizard Harry Potter continues to mature, so too does this exciting fantasy franchise."

            "Tennant loses tempo towards the end as he tries to shoehorn in sufficient rom to temper the com, but by then we've seen enough from Smith to know he can - and will - milk this genre for all it's worth.",
            "Hitch isn't a memorable date.",
            "I didn't expect much from Hitch and, not surprisingly, I didn't get much -- but I was entranced by the film nonetheless, from a historical perspective.",
            "I did enjoy the buddy dynamic between Smith and James, who puts kind of a cocky spin on the clumsy fat guy cliches. And there were about a half-dozen jokes that had me laughing out loud.",
            "It's witty, full of romantic wisdom and makes up for in laughs what it lacks in substance.",

            "An enjoyable cast and a couple of charming relationships are enough to make this a surprise.",
            "In the end, our arrogant hero is humbled and must face the fact that he has cut himself off from real feeling, the same with our heroine. Meeting each other has rendered all their tactics useless, and they stumble blind and grateful into each others arms.",

            "Will Smith charms again; best for teens and up.",
            "In a movie where the film's trailer has spoiled all its best scenes, and the onscreen chemistry between our primary lovebirds is a failed experiment, it's refreshing that \"Hitch\" still provides that rare buoyant romantic lift that the genre promises.",
            "Does everyone fall in love after the third date? In his world, they do.",
            "full review in Greek",
            "Fans of movies like The Wedding Planner and You've Got Mail looking for a charming date movie with lots of laughs will fall in love with Hitch.",
            "As a Will Smith movie, this isn't likely to blow either minds or the box office, but as romantic comedies go it's certainly better than the average.",
            "Does a fine job of staying away from an overage of boredom and sentimentality while providing a good mix of laughter along the way.",
            "For what it is, Hitch gets the job done.",
            "Will Smith can play a matchmaker, too!",
            "Very likeable and enjoyable for the most part, even endearing; the film stumbles a bit in the telling. Hitch just barely swings into a B+ on charm. ",

            "The main problem with the film is that it seems to be missing a sequence where we see Kat and Nick actually falling for each other - the script pretty much expects us to take it for granted just because they're the leads.",
            "Perfectly watchable even if it's deeply lazy filmmaking.",
            "Messing-Mulroney romantic comedy has \"something borrowed\" in its plot -- and a sense of missed opportunity that'll leave you blue.",

            "But I think that if you're a guy you would be best to avoid this like the plague!",

            "I don't feel totally satisfied with the emotional payoff, perhaps because it's so hard to associate with the characters, despite the fine performances. Fans, of course will love it.",
            "Turns out Eminem is a better faux-gangsta than 50 Cent. Now run along and bust yo dope rhymes at a Bat Mitvah before heading back to your 18-bedroom mansion in Farmington, CT. You're so street, Curtis.",

            "The best reason to see Richard Linklater's wholly unnecessary but highly enjoyable remake of The Bad News Bears is Billy Bob Thornton, who's doing a PG-13 version of his Bad Santa.",
            "Fortunately almost everyone acquits himself coolly and admirably.",
            "Billy Bob Thornton has proven he can do pretty much anything, but he simply does not look haggard, washed-up or miserable enough to be a believable Morris Buttermaker, the role Walter Matthau immortalized.",
            "It's no Bad Santa, but it's fun.",
            "This hasn't the advantage of seeming so new, nor so shocking. It mixes cute and crass with a dollop of social critique.",
            "A pleasant surprise out of leftfield.",
            "[W]hen one character looks down at a can of beer and remarks, 'Non-alcoholic? What's the point?' it feels a bit like the film is unknowingly judging itself. ",
            "An amiable enough remake of the 1976 classic that is helped greatly by some very funny work by Billy Bob Thornton.",
            "Bad News Bears finds Linklater marking time professionally enough -- and while hardly essential viewing, it's unpretentious, amoral fun. ",
            "Having cast a knowing eye on teen debauchery in Dazed and Confused and coaxed a stellar performance out of Jack Black in School of Rock, the director is just the man to launch a surprise spitwad attack in the current culture wars.",
            "If you're looking for another Adam Sandler/Jack Black comic masterpiece, this isn't it. It is, though, Billy Bob Thornton at his best, dropping analogies that would make a Hooters waitress blush.",
            "Even if you never saw the original Bad News Bears, you've probably seen this movie. You know, the one where the reluctant coach pulls together the ragtag bunch of misfits and teaches them important lessons about teamwork.",
            "Linklater's spirit is true: Practice still unfolds to the waltz of Carmen. Sentiment is avoided at all costs.",
            "Director Richard Linklater has wisely stayed with the structure of the 1976 classic (with Walter Matthau in the Butterworth role) but populated it with dialogue from Bad Santa's Glenn Ficarra and John Requa.",
            "Thornton [knocks] every one-liner out of the park with the free rein Linklater allows him, though a picked-up pace would've been welcome.",
            "Thornton is the real reason to watch. He plays most of his scenes with an understated unrepentant scumbaggishsness that makes him easy to simultaneously hate and like. It's a tricky balance to pull off, but he manages it well.",
            "Linklater's \"Bad News Bears\" doesn't approach the giddy comedy of Ritchie's original, but it does inspire an attentive contemplation on the similarities and differences between adults and children in approaching the game of life.",
            "Linklater's directorial prowess can not be argued, but \"Bad News Bears\" just isn't good enough to watch again...",
            "There are worse ways to spend an afternoon.",
            "Bad News Bears is packed with laughs, but almost all of them are cheaply won",
            "I'm not sure why filmmakers think we want to see kids put into dark situations and berated with profanities by Billy Bob Thornton.",
            "...what should've been a fun and breezy comedy is ultimately transformed into an incredibly tedious ordeal...",
            "There's just no reason for this thing.",
            "Ainda que esquem\u00e1tico, gera boas risadas gra\u00e7as \u00e0 din\u00e2mica entre Thornton e o elenco infantil."

            "Apart from Park's impressive but ultimately hollow style (his images are impeccably composed and visually inventive), Lady Vengeance is still an exercise in wretched excess (though less extreme than its predecessors).",
            "Powered by a glowering performance by actress Lee Young Ae, it is a walloping tale.",
            "Park Chan-wook focused on a female character and created a unique amalgam of black humor, blasphemous irony, extreme violence, which at times, is turned on children, and liberating humanism, chiefly depicted in the final sequence of collective revenge",
            "As a man is made to mediate the terms of his own murder, Park Chan-wook offers a perfect resolution to his \"Vengeance\" trilogy: an acutely agonizing elegy for whatever shred of humanity is left after the impulse for vengeance has worked itself out.",

            "The scenes portray a sense of innocence made all the more affecting by the fact that we know the war went on for years afterward, and a good (and true) example of why we'd fight a lot fewer wars if regular people made those decisions.",
            "Insipid manipulation masquerading as (and giving a bad name to) humanism",

            "Nominated for the 2005 Best Foreign Film Academy Award, \"Noel\" is the kind of sentimental tripe the Academy loves to honor in order to justify their own sentimental tripe.",

            "If Blue Velvet raised eyebrows, Matador will have some moviegoers blinking in disbelief.",
            "One of Almodovar's better features, although, like many of the others, it partially plays the role of popularizing stronger stuff, and resorts to some contrived plot devices in order to fuse its diverse story elements.",
            "Not so much a maelstrom as a mess of contrived eroticism, pretentious dialogue, and voyeuristic sensationalism, Almod\u00f3var's silly, cod-philosophical whodunit impresses only for its bravado.",
            "For all its jolts and bizarre flights of fancy, Matador is a marvelously fluid and darkly sensual film in which Almodovar elicits exquisitely controlled performances.",
            "It's a useful look at this Spanish auteur finding his way but lacks the elan of his later work.",
            "The film is fiercely funny, executed in a reckless, raucous rage by the most wantonly gifted new filmmaker on the international scene. Alm\u00f3dovar relishes mocking his country's sacred cows. ",
            "Almod\u00f3var celebrates the controversial potential of the medium more so than most other directors at work today. His movies get people talking and thinking.",
            "Screamingly funny, intriguing meditation on sex and violence, delving sacrilegiosuly into the Almodovarish underpinnings of that arch Spanish ritual, the bullfight.",

            "Almodovar's early work is saltry, erotic, even perverse, but very seductive to watch",
            "follows a bizarre, but ultimately logical path",
            "The \"prolonged orgasm\" is Almod\u00f3var's format and tenor",

            "The movie looks terrific and is acted with absolute, straight-faced conviction by the excellent cast...",
            "A richly detailed, physically gorgeous movie (Almodovar's most professional-looking work to that time) that almost has too much on its mind.",

            "Murder, mutilation, suicide and rape...[are] just a few of Matador's popcorn-incompatible themes. But [Almodovar] swirls his cape over these chargers so imaginatively, shamelessly and inventively, his flamboyance wins the day."

            "Not only is it a compelling and gripping drama, but it dares to take a balanced look at the conflict through the eyes of the people in the middle of it.",
            "The young Italian director Saverio Costanzo puts an unnervingly intimate twist on the costs of military occupation in this aptly claustrophobic drama.",
            "The film's dramatic potential is never fully exploited, as if the filmmakers too never dared to explore what happened on the first floor.",

            "The movie knows exactly what it's doing, and does exactly what it intends, without making one false move.",
            "You could dismiss this swankily shot Latin American trifle as an upscale soap opera, but that would be an insult to soap operas.",
            "There's also a tiresome, warmed-over feel to all the revelations -- one of which, a whopper, is never really resolved -- and the flat dialogue and one-dimensional characters make it impossible to care.",
            "Repressed desire! A sultry soap-opera star! Incest! Gay politics! La Mujer de Mi Hermano has it all. Now if it only had a decent plot.",
            "You've seen hotter stuff on Oxygen.",
            "The secrets behind the brothers' long estrangement are revealed in hallowed soap opera tradition, and the improbable ending to the film almost demands further installments.",

            "The movie is astonishingly simple-minded, depicting characters who obediently perform their assigned roles as adulterers, cuckolds, etc."

            "Ultimately the film delivers such a weak payoff that it makes nearly everything that came before it seem rather pointless.",

            "With not a pimp in sight, no mention of people-trafficking, and a single token drug-addict, this Spanish prostitution drama is serenely old-fashioned.",
            "The film has inspirational messages about the rewards of multicultural integration, but its tacit approval of prostitution as a rewarding career choice seems a bit peculiar.",
            "Compelling, frequently funny and, commendably, resists wrapping things up sentimentally. Nice Manu Chao soundtrack, too.",
            "Despite the difficult subject matter, there is colour and energy to the storytelling that betrays a diehard optimism and is vaguely reminiscent of Pedro Almodovar's films. Aranoa keeps a loose, fluid feel to the action and ups the tempo with music.",
            "Aranoa sketches a melancholy based on accurate human observation.",
            "While Princesas offers sensitive and beautifully wrought performances by its two leads (Candela Pena and Micaela Nevarez, who each won Goya Awards), the film offers little new in way of substance or theme.",
            "Princesas is heartwarming and sporadically surprising, bolstered by beautifully measured performances.",
            "Impressively directed, emotionally engaging drama with terrific performances from Candela Pena and newcomer Micaela Nev\u00e1rez.",
            "Slow moving but generally interesting...",
            "One of the very best films ever made about that most enduring of professions, prostitution.",
            "The most engaging presentation from the perspective of an exploited, female underclass since the equally-evocative Maria, Full of Grace.",
            "Una pel\u00edcula entra\u00f1able y conmovedora sobre la amistad y la solidaridad entre dos mujeres, con dos estupendas actrices.",
            "Writer-director Fernando Le\u00f3n de Aranoa embraces a pair of Madrid streetwalkers with such affection and compassion that their story, even though prostitutes are a staple of the movies, actually seems fresh and distinctive.",
            "Princesas rehearses 'hooker with a heart of gold' tropes and indulges Almod\u00f3varian clich\u00e9s of Spanish spunk and solidarity.",
            "Aranoa's film is a small miracle of controlled empathy.",
            "Fernando Leon de Aranoa confirms his Loach-like ability to convert marginalized subjects into socially committed cinema.",
            "In Princesas, [writer-director Fernando Le\u00f3n de Aranoa] leaves too many loose ends hanging about, but his sentiments are noble.",
            "Women become prostitutes for different reasons, and the reasons driving the main characters in Spanish writer-director Fernando Le\u00f3n de Aranoa's earnest tale of friendship couldn't be more different.",
            "This is a long film, but easy on the eyes.",
            "It's well-acted and strikingly shot, but it never quite reconciles its high-drama situations with its low-key approach.",
            "The film is bookended by remarkably astute and soul-deep performances from both Pe\u00f1a and Nev\u00e1rez, who adeptly reveal the many facets of their characters ...",
            "Two prostitutes in Madrid struggle to survive and keep their dreams of a better life alive.",
            "The way that Aranoa so clearly venerates his lively women feels Almod\u00f3var-esque, but the movie aims most of all to suggest that hookerdom is hell -- and it's neither realistic nor unsentimental enough to pull that off.",
            "Works best as a soberly witty commentary on the workplace."

            "Go for Zucker was a smash back home, where it was hailed as the first German comedy about Jews since World War II. But it will take more than that to make American audiences laugh."

            "The approach is dry as the Wyoming landscape, and while it occasionally threatens to pull the film out of shape, it's still the right one for these men.",
            "Lee and his collaborators have tapped into Proulx's story and gathered it up without missing a single sad, delicate nuance.",
            "Like all great love stories, Ang Lee's is one of tragic romance, strongly acted by Heath Ledger as the most buttoned-up of cowboys, and Michelle Williams as his betrayed and enraged wife.",
            "Ang Lee continues to astonish.",
            "The whole movie is a rich, spacious, passionate way of showing, not telling, feelings that dare not speak their name -- and doing so with superb intelligence and magnificent candour.",
            "Brokeback Mountain serves as something of an antidote to the incessant homophobic harping...",
            "It is challenging to find a movie that grabs you as hard as this does. The story lingers long after its woeful end, ultimately showing the power of such an amazing film, while also keeping and transferring the theme of longing to its audience.",
            "Heath Ledger gives an Oscar-worthy take on a man who already seems in mourning for a loss he will be late to grasp. ",
            "Ledger hits all the right notes as Ennis, delivering a quiet performance filled with heartache and sorrow. ",
            "The passion created here...makes no restrictions on who can understand and appreciate it. This is as fine a love story as there is. [May 10, 2018]",
            "Lee has crafted a film that flouts stereotypes and becomes one of the most sincere, most deeply felt love stories in years.",
            "What is remarkable about the film is how it doesn't politicise the homosexuality theme, transcends it to become the story of two people in doomed love. The two lead characters are wonderfully delineated. ",
            "The real achievement of Brokeback Mountain is not that it tells a universal love story that happens to have gay characters in it, but that it tells a distinctively gay story that happens to be so well told that any feeling person can be moved by it.",
            "An important and original romance that really and finally portrays the homosexual romance as two humans falling in love and never plays it for clich\u00e9s...",
            "A romantic western with a twist, Brokeback Mountain is a haunting and well acted exploration of a forbidden and secretive love affair between two cowboys. ",
            "Brokeback Mountain is ultimately about the paralysis of regret and how it fractures the lives of not just those afflicted by it, but everyone else around them.",
            "Lee can't tell the difference between criticizing oppression and turning out an oppressed work",
            "Arguably Ang Lee's best film, this swooning, achingly sad near-masterpiece offers a universal love story that lingers long in the mind.",
            "If you have the patience to sit through a slow-moving romance and you lack the vanity to be put off by explicit cowboy on cowboy relations, you'll greatly appreciate the light at the end of Brokeback Mountain, a work of art that's more than just a movie.",
            "At times feels as ancient and familiar as any well-worn piece of American legend, even if its content could set John Wayne spinning in his grave.",
            "At its core, Brokeback Mountain is not a gay love story%u2013it is simply a love story.",
            "It has the simplicity and clarity of a fable, wedded to the gnarled and taciturn physical realism of the Western.",
            "A masterful telling of star crossed love, with all the complications of any affair. Neither gratuitous nor shying away from the hidden pasion, Lee crafts a sublte and quite beautful film."

            "The frantic artificiality of the script rarely allows the characters to breathe. This is dinner-theater farce, featherweight and juiceless.",
            "It feels like [Pereira] just plucked the men themselves from atop a wedding cake and stuck them in his movie, where for the most part they stand decoratively around and watch the women make suds from all this soap.",
            "With what amounts to 20 characters crossing paths, Pereira's job description might seem more traffic cop than director, but he rises to the challenge and adds style and splashy color to boot.",
            "Spanish director Manuel Gomez Pereira certainly draws inspiration from his compatriot Pedro Almodovar -- several of the actresses are even Pedro alums -- but the film falls short of Almodovar's usual depth and complexity.",
            "Unfortunately for director and co-writer Manuel Gomez Pereira, all the energy in the world isn't enough to compensate for the superfluous plot lines and outrageous overacting that weigh down this bit of warm-hearted Spanish fluff.",
            "[It] portrays Spain as a country with a sense of humor, intelligence, and tolerance that should be an example for the world to follow. With so much goodness up there on the screen, it almost seems ungrateful to criticize the film for its technical faults.",
            "While straining credibility at times, offers some appealing scenes of quiet reflection, as well as a refreshing celebration of the ineffable allure and power of being middle-aged.",
            "The result is an episodic feel which lends itself that much more to the sense that Queens missed its calling as a soap opera. Indeed, the film lacks the complexity, visual style, and emotional charge of decent filmmaking.",
            "Pedro Almodovar-flavored but quite tame.",
            "The cast is perfect, but the script is like a low ceiling, keeping a lid on what should have been a confluence of riotous misadventures.",

            "An ungainly, broadly played comedy.",
            "With five overbearing mothers and six overshadowed gay sons, this Spanish meet-the-parents ensemble farce aims for Almod\u00f3var but falls far short.",
            "Queens is distinguished from a hundred other slick screwballers only by virtue of its theme -- the first mass gay wedding in Spain. Otherwise, it's middle-of-the-road formula fare all the way.",
            "A dithering but generous Spanish farce, Queens follows the coming nuptials of three gay couples by focusing on their overbearing mothers.",

            "Sumptuously filmed but rather distant.",
            "A drama by Ozon with noble intentions, far from cheap sentimentality, but it gives me the feeling that in his story of terminal illness there is a superficial indulgence that prevents it from being intimate. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Ozon has fashioned a \"masculine melodrama\" about how an impossibly beautiful, petulant young man copes with a precious few months. ",
            "Time to Leave strikes a certain register of restrained placidity, yet in the end, succumbs to more and more frequent idealizing interludes.",
            "It's a lovely film, with scattered wrenching moments, but it lacks the mannered impact of the rest of Ozon's oeuvre.",
            "It's noteworthy for the performances of Melvil Poupard as Romaine and Jeanne Moreau as the grandmother-two people facing their own mortality, and trying to exit this world with grace and dignity.",
            "Una exploraci\u00f3n muy personal, muy \u00edntima y para nada condescendiente sobre la proximidad de la muerte a edad temprana. Muy buen elenco.",
            "One gets the feeling while watching Time to Leave that the feisty director is, for the first time, bored by the story he's telling.",
            "It's difficult to feel positive about Romain's acceptance of his mortality, because Ozon hasn't convinced us Romain was that alive to begin with.",
            "takes one of the most tired movie cliches of all time -- \"I'm sorry, but you only have a few months to live.\" -- and turns into to a totally fresh look at what it truly means to live",
            "A touching and haunting film that is more uplifting than its central theme suggests, Time To Leave leaves us with much to reflect upon, and consider.",
            "Director Francois Ozon, who can define physical desire in a swift gesture or extend a moment of self-reflection with acute stillness, has become more confident and specific with each film.",
            "Those looking for the traditional Hollywood sweetness or payoffs will walk away disappointed, but the rough-hewn film offers riches to those willing to endure its downbeat tale of detachment.",
            "The story arc from his diagnosis to his death doesn't cover much ground in Romain's life. But his emotional landscape -- the conflicts, the anger, the sadness, the acceptance -- offers much more depth.",
            "Modern audiences are more likely to find the character's behavior to be extremely frustrating, undercutting any sympathetic response one might have for his situation.",

            "A film that asks us to have a pretty high tolerance of easy stereotypes and most of its comedy comes because you're not sure what else to do but laugh. When the ironic reversal kicks in, the film turns semi-serious and gets, if anything, a little boring.",

            "A small movie with a big soul and no easy formula for the happiness of its big-hearted characters.",
            "The pain that's evoked in this small, warm film -- the deep and unspoken yearning of child -- is as universal as it is heartbreaking.",
            "The film works as a highlight tape for the cast and will satisfy any desire you have to be driven to the brink of tears.",
            "There is no unnecessary dialogue, and Auerbach encourages us to listen closely and to study the situation. We are required to learn truths slowly, at the same pace as the characters.",

            "Butler's scenes with Jack McElhone are, like most of Dear Frankie, both unaffected and touching. ",
            "With great performances, a simple story, and an original ending, it's well worth watching...",
            "A quietly told film that--by casually tossing in a surprise here and a plot twist there--builds up to an ending that carries an intense emotional impact.",
            "Thanks to some wonderfully open-ended writing and acting, and Auerbach's fine attention to detail, Dear Frankie is one of those rare films that rewards repeat viewing.",

            "A touching little gem.",

            "There's a timeless quality about 'Dear Frankie.' This touching film tugs at your hearstrings and won't let go, even after the end credits roll.",
            "...a rare and endearing portrait of a mother's unconditional if not always judicious love for her only child.",
            "True to its weepy telefilm resemblance, Dear Frankie delivers several eye-dabbing moments, but the tears...are earned through solid storytelling and subdued acting.",
            " You'll see a lot worse ham-fisted dramas about busted-up but striving people this year.",
            "The film's sentimentality is balanced by a strong, hard-edged sense of reality at every turn."

            "It's a crime what happened to the wonderful African wilderness movie Duma in 2005. Beautifully directed by veteran Carroll Ballard, Duma fell flat in the United States because of bad timing and abysmal marketing.",
            "For those wishing they still made films like The Black Stallion, today is your lucky day.",
            "Visually panoramic, a film that revels in making the expanse of a beautiful place palpable.",
            "Too suspenseful for the youngest children, but for anyone older than 8 or 9, it evokes nothing less than awe at the harsh beauty of the natural world.",
            "With ravenous alligators and lions on the prowl, Duma delivers familiar adventure, but Ballard refuses to cater to cuteness.",
            "Like its title character, Duma has been left to fend for itself by Warner Bros., which is barely releasing it. A successful showing this weekend will prove that there really is an audience for this brand of thoughtful, literate family film.",
            "Enchanting coming-of-age story for kids.",
            "A pure children's film with an exciting story, genuine characters, and deep messages about life, love, and loss. ",
            "A handcrafted masterpiece.",
            "It's as good as this sort of thing gets, and deserves to be seen in a proper auditorium rather than on DVD.",
            "The film opens with some adorable cheetah cubs, so you're instantly hooked, but there's more to this than just a bunch of cute animals.",
            "... a beautifully photographed journey that will thrill youngsters and strongly engage adults.",
            "... leads us on a journey -- sometimes humorous, sometimes harrowing, always heartfelt -- that's well worth taking. ",
            "Director Carroll Ballard makes only one type of movie -- family adventures that feature some sort of wildlife. To his credit, however, he does them pretty well.",
            "Director Carroll Ballard ... not only captures stellar images of nature, but feels the call of the wild in his bones.",
            "Chances are excellent that Carroll Ballard's latest film 'Duma' isn't playing in a theater anywhere near you. That's a shame. It's one of those rare children's films that actually succeeds in delighting tots and their parents.",
            "Exciting but never violent, deeply emotional but never saccharine, Duma is the sort of solid family film Hollywood is always being criticized for not making any more.",
            "An old-fashion adventure yarn [and] an absolutely delightful throwback!",
            "Family films can be simplistic or condescending, but the joy of Carroll Ballard's work is that it's neither.",
            "Grabs for the gut by stoking primal understandings about our loving but tragically distant relationship with the wild.",
            "[Director] Ballard's dime-store philosophizing gets schmaltzy, but the emotions seem heartfelt. And as he has done in earlier movies, he incorporates some spectacular backdrops.",
            "Despite the outstanding cast of humans, Duma is the star, and Ballard obviously places a high value on exploring the real behavior of a cheetah, who is cute at times and potentially scary at others.",
            "Ballard gets laughs where he's supposed to, and thrills in all the right places."

            "Even as Crossing the Bridge acknowledges differences, tensions, the provocative power music exerts on our hearts, it makes an elegant, head-bopping, hip-swaying argument that sound unifies.",
            "It's a heady, occasionally free-floating mix, and a feast for music lovers.",
            "Akin's documentary gets its legs from the subtle questions it raises about Turkey's politics, nationalism, religious identity, cultural integrity and international perception.",
            "An infectious (in a good way) documentary.",
            "Though its photography is keen and vibrant and its concept elegantly simple, the movie doesn't quite add up beyond its performances.",
            "A delightful survey of Turkish music's many intriguing variations, as well as a fascinating, if somewhat superficial, portrait of one of the most historic cities on Earth.",
            "The music is gorgeous, and Akin's feverish camera shows an exile's love of the beautiful, crumbling but energized city as he pokes around its crevices, looking for recombinations of old and new, here and there.",
            "Though not nearly as exhilarating or illuminating as Buena Vista Social Club, this structurelss docu does capture the unique variety of sounds of Istanbul, a city strategically positied between East and West.",
            "Then-and-now footage of aging legends such as Erkin Koray and Sezen Aksu offers an insight into the musical continuum that bridges a rich heritage with a promising future.",
            "While Crossing the Bridge is sure to find an appreciative audience among world music aficionados, its crossover appeal seems limited at best.",
            "... an exciting introduction to a worthy musical world.",
            "You'll feel lucky for such a comprehensive introduction to Turkish music, and will no doubt be scrambling for a soundtrack album.",
            "It's a tasty sonic apertif to an unfamiliar world, and likely to inspire more than a few folks to make a beeline for the world music browser at the music store.",
            " The musical selections are nothing if not eclectic -- rock, hop-hop, psychedelic, folk, electronica, traditional -- and include some perky performances. But Crossing the Bridge is more than just a musical primer.",
            "It is our good fortune that Akin and his on-screen narrator, bass player Alexander Hacke, are our passionate guides through the country's musical history.",
            "If the music fails to hold your interest, there's always Madonna.",
            "An infectiously enjoyable survey of contemporary Turkish music, Fatih Akin's documentary works as a corollary to his breakout fiction film, Head-On.",
            "Presents diversity and richness of music in contemporary Istanbul.",
            "After surveying pop and rock hybrids, Akin and Hacke go deeper. You will be very happy indeed to make the acquaintance of such Turkish music luminaries as Orhan Gencebay and Sezen Aksu, whose stories and personalities are as fascinating as their music.",
            "Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul emphasizes the unique geography of the city to explain its eclectic music scene, and a generous sampling of performances clinches the argument.",
            "Crossing The Bridge was shot with an eye toward the kinetic, and cut with an impatience that shortchanges some of the artists, but keeps the rhythm lively."

            "There isn't a single moment in this film, front to end, that rings true.",
            "It is a handsome production, an epic fantasy for younger audiences with a spiritual message, and it was followed by two more films in the series. This one remains the most satisfying and inspiring.",
            "Because it is a children's story about children it is occasionally a bit precious, but only occasionally. For the most part it is an extremely well-designed piece of fantasy that doesn't try to overwhelm the audience.",

            "Dig that freaky symbolism!",
            "If von Trier can't be bothered to get out more, he should at least consider picking up a book or just using some real imagination.",
            "Manderlay is both more coherent and more obvious than Dogville, which lacked the clean narrative drive of the new film.",
            "Manderlay comes off as little more than a droning, embittered curiosity.",

            "The second installment in Lars von Trier's trilogy, USA: Land of Opprtunity, is a maor disappointment",
            "A superior entry to \"Dogville.\"",
            "\"Manderlay\" shows von Trier learning from that film's stylistic mistakes to make an ambitious and thought-provoking allegory about the ways in which \"slavery\" in America was never truly abolished, but rather converted to a different condition of capitalis",
            "It doesn't offer much insight into America's race issues, which might seem at first to be its target, but it works very well as a metaphor for America's intervention in Iraq.",
            "If this trilogy finishes up strong, this middle portion may come to be seen as the weakest, though it's still forceful and intimate in the von Trier manner.",
            "[It] raises interesting questions about what can happen in a democracy when its people are deeply corrupt. ... But likely to be more disheartened than enlightened.",
            "this Great Dane backs up his satiric bark with a vicious bite.",
            "A slightly more ponderous - if less dramatically satisfying - example of a Von Trier puppet show.",
            "Manderlay is an intellectually invigorating analysis of race, class, power and democracy, all while remaining a thoroughly enjoyable (if harrowing) film.",
            "Relying on a daring script as executed by A-list actors, offers a potentially transformational experience for any inclined to contemplate an introspective, gut-wrenching meditation on the intractability of the legacy of slavery.",
            "Manderlay is shorter but just as dull, pretentious and condescending as Dogville.",
            "I was intrigued by the intensity and audaciousness of Dogville, but Manderlay feels stagey, earnest, long and pretentious. Its grainy, shaky hand-held camera-work only adds to the monotony.",
            "The audience's familiarity with the stylistic devices of Manderlay should allow the film's more reflective screenplay to shine through."

            "An emotional journey, a showcase for two fine actors, and a multifaceted picture of love.",
            "A film to get lost in, a fragmentary, impressionistic trilogy of fleeting moments of love that is one of the best films of the year.",
            "Seen in isolation, the first episode has the most satisfying plot and the last the least. But the film's achievement lies mostly in the beautifully articulated similarities and differences among the three.",
            "Three varieties of love: unfulfilled, mercenary, meaningless. All photographed with such visual beauty that watching the movie is like holding your breath so the butterfly won't stir.",
            "Great cinema, pop romance that carries a special charge.",
            "The first of the three stories is the best., with good visual style.",
            "Lambent",
            "If you are easily lulled into a sensuous rhythm of pure cinematic languor, this will satisfy. If not, you may be banging your head against the back of your seat.",
            "[Hou's] work gains significance due to his specifically tying this theme of love to Taiwan in particular, as opposed to just proposing a general essay on love.",
            "Hou Hsiao Hsien is quite simply one of the world's premier filmmakers yet his films are lucky to play a few festival dates here in the U.S.",
            "An emotionally understated giant of a love story.",
            "Carefully crafted and bereft of dialogue, Three Times sets the bar high with its opening salvo but can't sustain the momentum.",
            "Assembles all of the major settings of the last 20 years of Hou's career into a single portmanteau of miscommunication and frustrated ardor.",
            "This is a fascinating exercise in utilising style to make subtle psychological and political statements.",
            "The style is pure Hou: richly textured atmosphere, tiptoeing camerawork and long, languorous takes of scenes full of privileged moments of human activity.",
            "Filmmaker Hou Hsiao-Hsien tries to tell three tales of romance during different parts of the 20th and 21st centuries. But he winds up stretching a modestly interesting premise out too long -- over more than two hours.",
            "The film is probably too slow, too silent and too long for most audiences. But look beyond the quietness, and you'll discover a three-gem jewel.",
            "Can a film be exquisite and, at the same time, less than one hoped for? This question arose as Three Times unfolded.",
            "A discreetly cosmic, majestic trilogy.",
            "The deceptive simplicity of these vignettes, written by Chu Tien-wen, throws into relief Hou's formidable storytelling strengths and visual acuity -- his way with actors, his subtlety and expressiveness.",
            "I urge you to see the ineffably beautiful Three Times however you can, lest you go on thinking that Hou's greatness is merely the supposition of obscurantist critics.",
            "Love is messy, desperate, inconclusive and wonderful -- even for little moments -- in any time. And Hou has done it justice with this new masterpiece."

            "The slaughter in Saw II is pretty much non-stop, but you always see it coming. The movie's not really that scary, just gross in what by now is a fairly routine way.",

            "An impressive achievement.",

            "Ichikawa evokes the heady and suffocating effect of the past playing irrevocable catch-up with itself.",

            "Unshakably harrowing but deeply moving.",
            "The film achieves a dramatic intensity that is both admirable and frustrating.",
            "Lewis makes Keane's paranoia our paranoia. Kerrigan limits our world to his world. And that's how this grimly shot, roughly felt drama pulls us in.",
            "When it comes to an emotional payoff at the end, unlike most Hollywood films, it has earned it.",
            "Lodge Kerrigan is one of the great, though largely unheralded, filmmakers of our time.",
            "Only Kerrigan's previous Clean, Shaven surpasses Keane as a sympathetic study of a man unravelled.",
            "One's compassion is both challenged and expanded by a rare movie that really does go its own way.",
            "[Lewis] immerses himself so deeply in Keane's psyche and skin that you easily forget this is acting, not real life.",
            "Aside from Lewis's excellent acting, there's little reason to spend two hours with Keane.",
            "A small wonder of a minimalist morality tale.",
            "The role of Keane is a tall order, as he's onscreen for every frame of the film, but Lewis is just brilliant, holding our attention and ultimately our compassion for a deeply troubled man. ",
            "Affliction has rarely been so sensitively explored.",
            "A psycho-underworld tour de force like Irreversible or The Machinist, impressive as far as it goes (not far), single-minded but without enough on its mind, a gimmick flick.",
            "The entire second half of the film...is unbearably tense....Lewis, whose performance is the overwhelming center of the piece, deserves a large share of the credit for making the entire thing so grueling.",
            "It's in that breathtaking humanism, its illustration of the way we connect to one another, and how brittle that social fabric can be, that the film touches on sublimity.",
            "[Damian Lewis] is utterly riveting as a man who is all too aware that he's looking into the abyss and the scenes where he dips into outright mentalism are extremely uncomfortable to watch.",
            "The next time you see someone railing in the streets -- fighting a battle you'll never understand -- you may remember Keane and pause to reflect.",
            "As good as Lewis is -- and he's in every frame of this 93-minute movie -- it's Kerrigan's astounding gift for addressing the wounded that demands celebration.",
            "With its endless close-ups, it's almost suffocating in intensity, but is saved by Kerrigan's sympathy for his character, and Lewis' utterly realistic performance.",
            "Professionals in the mental health field may find this film interesting; the rest of us will probably find our attention wandering a bit, pondering how good Keane might have been.",
            "A movie that puts you so far into someone else's head you may have forgotten your own name by the time it's over."

            "A classic European film noir with an irresistible score by Miles Davis, it builds tension from a series of seemingly minor mistakes that echo the political/military context of the postwar era.",
            "Elevator to the Gallows, killer stuff.",
            "Elevator to the Gallows married a new kind of jazz to a new kind of cinema, and created something altogether sublime.",
            "The film's alchemic blend of Bressonian rigor, Hitchcockian suspense, and overall proto-Nouvelle Vague cool more than compensates for its straightforward plotting ...",
            "Lift to the Scaffold (Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud) was the perfect opening to the French New Wave in 1958, sashaying in to a jazz score from Miles Davis and starring Jeanne Moreau as a mistress-in-peril.",
            "Louis Malle's supremely stylish New Wave thriller combines Miles Davis's music, Henri Decae's wonderfully evocative black-and-white cinematography of Paris and plenty of close-ups of a young Jeanne Moreau looking very anguished.",
            "It's a compelling but gangly first film, with a few head-scratching plot holes, but those complaints seem insignificant in the glare of the Paris lights, the flare in Jeanne Moreau's eyes and the blare of Miles Davis' trumpet.",
            "Malle spins new webs around typical noir conventions, giving darker implications of fate and comeuppance a fresh verve.",
            "The experiencing of watching Malle's 1958 debut is akin to that of watching a preordained outcome, much like an academic thesis, work itself out, with much of the suspense residing all in the journey rather than the destination.",
            "Malle made his feature directorial debut with this assured thriller, which recalled both the poetic realism of Marcel Carn\u00e9 and the brooding menace of American films noirs.",
            "Striking to look at, with each frame resembling an intricately designed photograph ...",
            "The ambition is bracing, but critical hindsight obscures how exciting Malle's noir thriller is on its own terms.",
            "What a supremely stylish and watchable picture it is.",
            "Few debuts come punchier, cooler, and more influential than Louis Malle's 1958 thriller about a Parisian murder plan unravelling, scene by fateful scene.",
            "Its constituent parts are great, but just don't come together to make a coherent and satisfying movie.",
            "Louis Malle's brilliant feature directorial debut is a stylish film noir, boasting great jazz score and impressive performance from the young Jeanne Moreau.",
            "the score by Miles is a remarkable one, tapping into the jazzy zeitgeist of the time",
            "Efficient but soulless.",
            "Elevator to the Gallows is a treat for the film buff. Watching Moreau and Malle as they discover each other and a new trend in filmmaking, and listening to Miles Davis during their quest will remind you of what movies are all about.",
            "It's devilishly clever, bleakly hilarious, and fatalistically romantic throughout, a celebration of grand, doomed gestures made for the sake of making them.",
            "Made almost 50 years ago, the black-and-white French classic still grabs you by the throat.",
            "Director-writer Louis Malle's first feature at 26 is a stylish French New Wave noir-ish thriller that never satisfies as much as it should."

            "New York in the 1970s seems like an arena of nonstop gratification, but one that can only be understood in the context of the repression and fear that had gone before. It seems as distant as the 1890s.",
            "... lacks the authority of such gay documentary classics as \"Word Is Out\" and \"Before Stonewall,\" which were far more inclusive.",
            "An engrossing piece of social history, a lively, astonishingly well-documented excavation of that period between June 1969 and June 1981 when gay men in New York experienced a bacchanalian burst of sexual liberation.",
            "The faces of that movement are what sell this story -- with enthusiasm, not regret.",
            "Despite the retrospective sensationalism, Lovett's 70-minute documentary is a sobering anti-erotic cautionary tale.",
            "The pure filmmaking lets the people tell their stories with honesty and insight.",
            "This is an immersive documentary, evoking the period, and arguing the case that although the unbridled hedonism did bring dangers and problems with it, there was also something of a idyllic euphoria experienced by those in this first wave of gay freedom.",

            "It's a worthwhile documentary on a worthy subject, one that is pursued painstakingly by director Joseph F. Lovett.",
            "... Lovett's tribute to a bygone era feels like it might resonate deeper if context and character overpowered story upon story of sexual excess.",
            "Lovett's nostalgic paean to the erotic utopia of his youth.",
            "Lovett backs up his assertion that the decade bracketed by the 1969 Stonewall riots, marking the beginning of gay liberation, and the emergence of AIDS in 1981 was 'the most libertine period the Western world has known since the Roman Empire.'",
            "Lovett's lively, impassioned, well-structured documentary is enhanced by stacks of explicit photos and the reminiscences of men who lived through the decade.",

            "Modest, moving and intelligently assembled.",
            "His film, both reverent and affectionate, has at its heart a story that richly deserves the telling.",
            "What a delightful group they are -- sharp, witty, chic survivors who forged new lives and successful careers in new countries.",
            "A touching film, providing a glimpse into yet another hidden story about the history of European Jews before the arrival of the Nazis.",
            "It seems that some stories, especially those that study human nature, are universal.",
            "Surprisingly complex and moving, Yaron Silberman's vibrantly nostalgic documentary succeeds because it is about more than its surface subjects, young Jewish women who were champion swimmers in the 1930s whose lives were interrupted by the war. ",
            "The film's real power comes from the women's personalities.",
            "That the film is watchable is largely due to the women, any of whom could have been the subject of a better, considerably more focused film.",
            "It is a treat to encounter the fierce, brave, learned women of Watermarks.",
            "Not especially lively filmmaking, but Zilberman has unearthed some terrific footage of the club in its heyday.",
            "The film's denouement is one of triumphant symbolism as the women return to Vienna for a swim in their former pool. There are no medals given for this reunion, but it's definitely one that deserves a cheer.",
            "One of the most amazing aspects of this film is how many of the octogenarian-plus swimmers have survived after first fleeing post-Anschluss Austria for the four corners of the world.",
            "The images of them swimming together after all those years are beautiful and a little holy: They look like angels in the water.",
            "Not a great movie, but contains fascinating historical material.",
            "This account of the pre-Nazi glory and subsequent harrowing fate of the Austrian Jewish sports club Hakoah makes for a necessary corrective to Leni Riefenstahl's grudgingly admired Olympic myth-mongering.",
            "Hugely entertaining and wonderfully warm documentary.",
            "A moving, poignant tale about triumph in the face of the unthinkable.",
            "As documentaries go, Watermarks is nothing special. But the women who inhabit it are sensational.",
            "Moving documentary.",
            "A moving documentary that approaches the Holocaust from a fresh, intimate perspective.",
            "The excellent film combines a wealth of archival material with the reminiscences of an unforgettable group of octogenarian women who were champion swimmers when Hitler annexed Austria in 1938.",
            "Sometimes funny, sometimes wrenching and persistently bittersweet, tale is a fascinating account of strength and solidarity, bolstered by vintage photos, edifying newsreels and winningly frank interviews."

            "Beauchamp, who worked on his film for nine years, dutifully reinterviews the surviving witnesses, and more effectively than any previous documentary or return look at the case, re-creates the atmosphere of a 1950s Mississippi.",
            "This well-focused, short (75 minute) film will be an eye opener for those who didn't live through the era. For those who did, it will be all too familiar.",
            "Untold Story is a documentary of compassion and urgency, a film that cries out, as virtually every film and story on this subject does, for justice, something that didn't happen in 1950s Mississippi.",
            "Potent and searing.",
            "You leave the theater feeling moved by a mother's courage, sickened by the crime and a little frustrated, wondering if this unquiet moment in our history will ever rest easy.",
            "Beauchamp expertly excerpts long stretches from the extensive television coverage of the 1955 events, juxtaposing them with present-day interviews with the people who lived though these traumatic happenings.",
            "Eye-opening docu on horrific '50s murder has graphic images. ",
            "Features some sweet moments of reflection by the late Mamie Till during which she wistfully reminisces about the intelligent, curious and animated son taken away from her so brutally and senselessly.",
            "In his retelling of the events, Beauchamp reconstructs the legacy of diaspora.",
            "uncovers additional evidence and becomes both a suitable memorial as well as a call to action",
            "The film is only 70 minutes long, but it is nearly impossible to sit through, not only because of the lingering image at its center of Emmett Till's battered body but because of the visceral sense of outrage it can't help but provoke in you.",
            "Beauchamp reaches this point without exploitation or cheap foreshadowing; there are no dramatic music stings underlying the outwardly innocuous biography before it methodically descends into true American tragedy.",
            "It seems all too easy nowadays to think this stuff is all ancient history...Beauchamp's bracing wake-up call shows otherwise.",
            "The story has been told often in film and literature, but in The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till ... director Keith Beauchamp takes a rewarding approach.",
            "Whatever power Keith Beauchamp's film possesses as a work of art has been superseded by its political impact...",
            "Beauchamp must be applauded for not only for his investigative daring but also for his unflinching courage.",
            "A testament to the power of film.",
            "[Beauchamp's film] has an earnest solemnity that is appropriate to the material.",
            "A painful reminder that reparations still need to be made for what whites have done to blacks in this country.",
            "One of the most powerful, important things a documentary can do is bear witness to man's inhumanity to man, and document for posterity crimes that cry out for justice, however tardy.",
            "I expect more from a theatrical release, more than just information presented in an orderly fashion.",
            "I can't recommend the film strongly enough.",
            "As important for its social and legal implications as for its cinematic qualities, Keith A. Beauchamp's film about the brutal murder that helped spark the civil rights movement transcends its genre.",
            "The film is a shocking account of the deep-seated racism that existed in the South in the dawn of the civil rights movement."

            "An absorbing Holocaust drama that suggests the forces that drive us toward good or evil are constantly warring within all of us.",

            "Wickedly funny and astonishingly conceived, the film is a nonstop cavalcade of shocks, surprises and enchantments. I loved every minute of it.",
            "By turns absurdly funny, disturbingly dissolute, unnervingly claustrophobic, and caustically misanthropic, Lunacy offers viewers the sort of punishing pleasures that so many of its characters seem, in their different ways, to seek.",
            "As pure cinema, there's no denying the power of Lunacy, although mostly that power can best be described as, well, sadistic.",
            "Svankmajer continues to push at the boundaries of convention, juxtaposing blasphemy and torture while mocking the possibility of transcendence.",
            "The definition of liberation as the act of being delivered from the hands of one lunatic into the hands of another who is equally mad remains universal in its political and social applications.",
            "For all the arresting visuals, Svankmajer's morose depiction of the blurry line between madness and sanity is surprisingly pedestrian.",

            "These ideas are twisted enough that they still hold a certain kind of interest.",

            "Lunacy lacks the teeth to be truly audacious. Yet its leisurely pacing and silly send-ups of psychosexual perversions make it an amusing enough gothic comedy.",

            "The film feels most authentic when it talks about the exhilaration and the freedom Van Zandt and other musicians feel when they cut off ties to family and home to make a songwriter's life on the road.",
            "A textured, elegiac, and deeply plangent music documentary. Brown's film, never exposing Van Zandt to too much harsh light, preserves this enigma just enough that it makes you want to go back to the music after you've caught these glimpses of the man.",

            "Manages a pretty fair portrait of Van Zandt and his personal demons, pressures and joys.",
            "Brown weaves together audio footage and taped interviews that show a man whose proximity to death had calcified into a sharp blade of self-deprecating wit.",
            "...required viewing for Van Zandt fans, probably required for country music fans, and even of interest to those with no great affection for either.",
            "Unlike many music documentaries, this is not a drab, talking-heads affair but a portrait assembled from evocative images and songs.",
            "A sobering but compassionate look at a man who ultimately might have been even more troubled than gifted.",
            "An unnarrated collection of gently told reminiscences that rove impressionistically, the film touches on various points in a career that remained a well-kept secret from the start, when Van Zandt began performing in the late 1960s.",
            "Brown has put together a heartbreaking yet inspiring portrait of a transcendently tragic artist through home movies, family scrapbooks, live performances and interviews with ex-wives, record producers, and peers.",
            "Both frustrating and touching."

            "Far too often, Douglas indulges his preference for the superficial over the substantive.",

            "While the camera does capture some terrific images of a part of the country that seems to have been stopped in time some decades ago, too often the condescending tone and pretentiousness undercut the attempts at sociological exploration.",

            "Dorian Blues makes me yearn for the day that audiences have become so comfortable enough with this subgenre that a clever director can make a spoof in which many if not all of the conventions get lampooned.",
            "Rarely feels fresh. It's special, but in an after-school sort of way.",
            "While Bardwell's screenplay wobbles somewhat in tone, it displays enough wit and charm to compensate for its lack of polish.",
            "The linchpin relationship is the underlying deep bond between the two brothers, and the scenes between McMillian and Coco are well written and equally well played.",
            "It's a sweet and likable movie, if not an expert one, and a respectable entry in the genre.",
            "fun and satisfying %u2014 if not truly groundbreaking",
            "McMillian and the big Coco are excellent, and Fletcher makes something scarily comical of dad's hardball glares and proudly Nixonian grievances.",
            "May not break new ground, but thanks to some sharp writing and ingratiating performances, it farms the old fields quite productively.",
            "The movie is occasionally funny and it has charm, mostly thanks to Michael McMillian. It's not exactly original, but it is borderline entertaining.",
            "Cute, clean and snappy.",
            "A palpably heartfelt final scene between Dorian and his mom ends the tale on a powerful note.",
            "The amateurish, too-bright cinematography merely adds to the synthetic quality of everything transpiring onscreen.",
            "Dorian Blues fits tidily into a genre of first-time films in which the main gay character comes of age and out of the closet.",
            "Some of the humor feels pretty staged, but Dorian isn't without its charms.",
            "Dorian Blues eschews the heavy sexual content (and most of the clich\u00e9s) of so many gay films - - it also has a lot of heart.",
            "This upstate New York coming-out saga will warm PFLAG hearts and kindle empathy in those who've had to tread the family-drama-churned waters of small-town gaydom.",
            "Ultimately has little insight into the experience it chronicles. News flash: growing up gay is rough. Who did not know this already?",
            "Has a terrible air of been-there/done-that.",
            "Coming-out films are not uncommon but rare are the ones directed by straight dudes and cut from such an abnormal mold as Dorian Blues.",
            "Offers nothing special in outline, but sharp performances and writing lend it a fresh appeal well above this genre's average."

            "We get a distractingly vapid couple who tend to drain the emotional resonance of these extraordinary, ever-shifting tableaux.",
            "Churns like classic tragedy while its pace is set by Angelopoulos' trademark, spooky portentousness.",
            "This is the first of an announced trilogy, but it already feels as long as the 20th century itself.",
            "Angelopoulos has, irrespective of his own efforts, acquired a depth granted with age, sacrificing the striking clarity and precision of his earlier work for a contemplative freedom of movement.",

            "Visually, this can't be bettered, but the superficial storyline and cypher-like characters are undeniably disappointing.",

            "There are also moments of such breathtaking grace and artistry that you'd be forgiven for thinking you're watching the most beautiful movie ever made.",
            "Angelopoulos has created a memorably sweeping survey, but even an epic needs some moments of genuine intimacy.",
            "It's like looking at a technically-polished painting, but not being fully drawn in.",
            "The first in a projected trilogy by the Greek director Theo Angelopoulos, The Weeping Meadow is a beautiful and devastating meditation on war, history and loss.",
            "Not for all tastes, it's recommended for discerning viewers.",
            "The movie plays like a career summation in which the 68-year-old writer-director has simply run out new ideas.",
            "It's Homeric filmmaking, uniquely worthy of the word.",
            "Angelopoulos does not relate the story of his country so much as linger amid the whispered backstories of its citizens, and we are somehow left to fill in the shadowy gaps.",
            "The first film in a projected trilogy by the Greek filmmaker Theo Angelopoulos is visually stunning but lacking in emotional firepower.",
            "A work of Olympian aloofness.",
            "Angelopoulos has given his modern story the devastating emotional impact and resonance of a classic Greek tragedy."

            "As bright and shiny as you would imagine something co-produced by NBA Entertainment to be, The Year of the Yao provides little insight beyond hanging out with its super-sized star.",
            "There appears to be much more to Yao than is captured here. That's where the movie drops the ball.",
            "A surprisingly layered portrait of a rookie with the hopes of a nation -- a big nation -- riding on his shoulders, and the frustrations and small victories that entails.",
            "Sure, it's fun to watch big-screen close-ups of Yao battling with O'Neal, though it feels like another ESPN special.",
            "The film never feels like some sort of shill, but an actual historical document of this strangest of cultural immersions for a national superstar.",
            "By playing up the hoopla and glitz, the filmmakers have created a vacuum at its center.",
            "The film is happily as fast paced as the sport of basketball itself: there are no bearded, stuttering academics discussing any aspect of the story.",
            "there's plenty to see in this engaging film",
            "...a particularly crude sales job.",
            "[A] glorified infomercial.",
            "Sporadically charming basketball documentary.",
            "Easily the best basketball film I've seen in years.",
            "The movie's focus on Yao is limited by his lack of narrative abilities.",
            "From language barriers to international political barriers, Yao promises something most documentaries miss entirely -- insight and hope.",
            "There's not much else of interest going on.",
            "...while their subject is amiably charismatic, the filmmakers fail to fully get beneath his skin. Still...it's a sports documentary that can be enjoyed by anyone...",
            "The excitement on the court and the banter and good-natured ribbing in the locker room is handled by the book by the behind the camera crew.",
            "More of a promo than anything else: it sells us on the concept of Yao Ming, but has next to nothing to say about him.",
            "A very compelling sports documentary.",
            "Win or lose, in an era of sports idols as rock stars, Yao is a breath of fresh air.",
            "One expects it to be a feel-good, emphasize-the-positive kind of movie, and it is. But there are several other fascinating angles to be found here."

            "Despite an anticlimactic finale and a flimsy storyline, there are enough endearing moments of hope and redemption here to keep 39 Pounds worth its weight.",
            "It's clear that Ami is no one to pity. Despite what might seem overwhelming physical handicaps, he's able to achieve and enjoy more, and relate more effectively to the people around him, than at least 90 percent of his 'normal' fellow humans.",

            "Mid-life crisis takes on a completely new meaning when a skin and bones muscular dystrophy victim risks death for one last Harley ride and a bus to the Grand Canyon.",
            "...Ami's 'message to the world,' that with a love for life anything can be accomplished, frankly feels cliched and entirely overblown as presented here.",
            "While more video diary than polished documentary, it's nonetheless an absorbing, painful, and inspiring look at Ami's impossible trek across the United States to find the misguided doctor who once predicted he wouldn't live past the age of six."

            "Even Howard and Goldsman's penchant for being over-sentimental doesn't scupper the emotional punch Braddock's story packs. That's largely down to Crowe's utterly convincing performance. ",
            "The complexities of genuine human beings have no place in a Ron Howard production. This is film where a good woman stands behind her man, children listen to their father, and the Great Depression is described as a bit of hard times.",

            "And as far as Cinderella's pumpkins go, though the movie ends with Braddock's boxing triumph in Hollywood's notorious freeze-frame approach to history, both Braddock and Baer went on to be decked by Joe Louis.",

            "Howard may have replicated the family scenes as accurately as if he'd found film from a camera hidden in the walls of the original Braddock apartment, and yet the movie can't shake the sense that the scenes away from the boxing ring are somehow false",
            "The film wallows in the poverty and degradation of Crowe and his family, which is a real downer for a supposed feel-good movie . . ."

            "Major Dundee, not a great movie but a great star-driven, big budget 1965 studio western, is back in all its fractured glory and confidence.",
            "It's richer and more interesting, partly because some motivations have been cleared up, partly because the music isn't a burden and partly because we now can see that this was all leading to the creation of a truly great film four years later.",
            "Despite the cuts which thin out the final stages of the story, and despite a flabby performance from Richard Harris which very nearly destroys the balance, the film is a fascinating study in the swing of a pendulum.",

            "Peckinpah's Western, starring Charlton Heston, is compromised due to studio interverence, but it still has merits",
            "This restored version demonstrates is that while it remains an uneven work, it has flashes of brilliance as well as a general air of competence, even elegance in storytelling.",
            "They don't make movies or movie directors like this anymore.",
            "The new Dundee plugs some of the story holes but, sadly, it's still a plodding affair that's low on plausible character motivation and compelling action scenes.",

            "The restored version becomes a near masterpiece--a most powerful but fragmented western of epic proportions.",
            "Still a mess of great scenes sprinkled among some fairly monotonous action. But it's never completely dull.",
            "It's half a great movie.",
            "It's hard to imagine The Wild Bunch having the depth and grace it did without Peckinpah having this experience to draw on, and for that masterful film alone we're grateful to have Major Dundee back among the living again.",
            "...it is still incomplete - permanently so, since crucial scenes were never even shot - and the seams show.",
            "The 12 minutes excised from the preview version have been recovered, and they go a long way toward clarifying some of the film's murkier passages."

            "The cinematic version should have focused on the strength of the orphans' tales, without wasting time with story framing.",
            "The Great Water's greatest value is its depiction of a society that was as savagely committed to a false idea as its neighbor nations, but that somehow moved back toward reality -- and humanity -- before the Iron Curtain fell.",
            "Portentous melodrama.",

            "Avrich's colorful account of Wasserman's career starts out looking like a puff piece, but quickly reveals a refreshing willingness to delve into the dirty side of a glamorous business.",
            "The jazzy credit sequence uses Wasserman's trademark big black eyeglasses as a playful motif, but the film itself is all business",

            "What we do see in The Last Mogul is certainly worthwhile. But it would be informative mainly to people unfamiliar with Wasserman.",
            "More often than not, The Godfather comes to mind as Avrich maps out Wasserman's dalliances with politicians and mobsters, underscoring his remarkable facility for using them both to his advantage.",
            "Pic draws a full and balanced measure of the man, from his stratospheric rise to a remarkably humbling fall, and includes as thorough a study of the super-agent-turned-mogul's shady ties with organized crime as any feature docu could hope to muster.",

            "You know where this is going, but it is done well. Curtis Hanson who directed L.A. CONFIDENTIAL and WONDER BOYS manages to make this one work",
            "In between the first 20 and last 20 minutes this is an excellent film. Absolutely top notch dialogue -- smart, biting, and very well delivered.",
            "Easily feels predictable, but the movie did such a good job in making me angry with these characters that I began to genuinely pull for them when they started to become better people.",

            "This intermittently effective UK horror thriller carefully establishes the psychological relationships among the women, then squanders this calibrated and generally plausible setup with a series of crude, implausible, and scattershot horror effects.",
            "The film draws on some of horror's most memorable scenarios.",
            "The Descent sustains a level of intensity that most horror films can barely muster for five minutes.",
            "For my money, [the] first 20 or so minutes are the best in the film. Once the real adventure gets underway in the cave, things get less interesting.",
            "While the movie has wonderful moments of unmotivated tension that make sure we're quite ill at ease from the beginning, it's also got a few too many of the kind of cheap boo-scares that indicate a director not fully trusting his grip on you.",
            "The Descent is a phenomenal movie anyway, its women so brave, so dedicated to one another, so mistrusting or untrustworthy; its caves alternate between terrifying and beautiful...",
            "This punishing British-produced thriller knows how to do the fright thing without making any of the wrong moves we associate with standard-format hack-'em-ups.",
            "RECOMMENDED \"Deliverance\" with alpha-female spelunkers instead of macho men, set in caverns rather than on an endangered river, Neil Marshall's intense, bloody, emotionally viscid [movie] is a neatly elegant bite of malicious terror.",
            "The movie unfolds in a satisfying slow-burn that makes you feel uneasy until it takes that anxiety and turns it into pure nightmare fuel by making your worst fears real.",
            "The best horror film since The Blair Witch Project.",
            "A smart, fresh and exhilarating genre movie. ",
            "An all-female cast, a claustrophobic cave setting draped in red light, and an anarchic, vicious fight to the death...need I say more about one of the most physically taxing movies of the century?",
            "The Descent is already unusual for being a horror movie with an all-female cast, but it's even more unique for being the kind of movie that explores the damage caused by a friend's betrayal.",
            "Here is a movie so precise and cautious with its material that every moment, every suggestion or action, becomes an experience that involves us to alarming lengths.",
            "Super-scary and vicious, both psychologically and physically, this cleverly produced chill-ride is edgy British horror at its very best.",
            "Tense, gory and masterfully malevolent.",
            "Although Neil Marshall's attempt to justify the U.S. ending is admirable, the original ending is the only way out - providing a chilling bookend to a motif and suggesting what seems like cerulean-tinged peace is actually the solitary solace of madness.",
            "Director Marshall has obviously kept his DVD player spinning for days studying all of the classics and simply taking everything he needed like a Vanilla Ice \"Under Pressure\"",
            "Blank screamers, fastidiously amplified \"boos,\" and the most confused intimations of lesbianism since High Tension",
            "The ensuing carnage is ample but not gratuitous; every arterial spray and bone crack makes a point. ",
            "It's nasty, unpleasant and sadistic but brutally efficient and undeniably effective.",
            "[Writer-director Neil] Marshall makes real movies, not just schlockfests designed to sate the lusts of gore-lovers (although there is plenty of gore, too).",
            "Where the film exceeds 'Dog Soldiers' is toward the end, as Sarah comes to grips with what it will take to survive her ordeal and gets in touch with her feral side."

            "Nolan takes an admirable stab at developing a character-driven drama, only to give in to generic action-movie conventions with a blinding, deafening, explosion-laden finale that could have capped off any number of interchangeable Jerry Bruckheimer flicks.",
            "Batman Begins summons up moments of great eloquence and power. If only its cast of characters was as fully inhabited as its turbulent city.",
            "It's not just the birth of Batman we're seeing in this triumphant interpretation, it's also the dawning of Gotham City's age of greed.",
            "The psychological realism and the science-fiction villainy don't always mesh seamlessly. But unlike so many superheroic summer spectacles, this one actually has a soul behind the special effects.",
            "Here's how any great franchise should start: with care, precision and delicately wrought atmosphere.",
            "A nonstarter.",
            "All in all, it definitely changes the course - for the better - of this formerly failing franchise.",
            "Batman is shackled by one of the most potent recurring themes in Nolan's work: a fear of the past, in all its pain, guilt and trauma - a fear that the forward march of time may not be enough to heal.",
            "Batman Begins is an utterly conventional, conformist work, respectful of order and wealth, unable or unwilling to challenge any of contemporary society's taboos. Worse than that, its grim pomposity and self-seriousness invite only laughter.",
            "Batman Begins is certainly a worthy staging post in the inescapably compelling career of Christopher Nolan, and stands the test of time some 15 years after its release.",
            "Batman Begins is easily one of the best films featuring the iconic DC Comics superhero, but far from perfect, despite telling what may just end up being the definitive big screen origin story for the Dark Knight. ",
            "Bale provides the series with the best Batman thus far, with a dark and conflicted performance that easily matches Nolan's tone.",
            "With a phenomenal cast, technical work that is beyond reproach and attention to detail that is generally only seen in works by Spielberg or Lucas, Batman Begins is a perfect way to begin the summer movie season.",
            "The Batman origin story that we've been waiting for!",
            "The film looks great and there some striking set-pieces, but in spite of a series of comic quips -- the new film lacks a sense of adventure and fun. Nevertheless, Nolan, Goyer and Bale have still managed to revitalize the ailing franchise. ",
            "I like that it embraces comic book sensibilities a little bit more than other Nolan films. Definitely a bit too long but a good origin story",
            "Batman has been all about darkness, Nolan just makes it a shade darker. Go see it.",
            "That the movie ends up thematising the murk of our modern world, if not exactly piecing it together into a comprehensible whole, is perhaps as much as we can expect.",
            "Nolan has created a Batman epic that races so far ahead of its predecessors that they simply cease to exist. ",
            "Batman Begins isn't a terrible film, it simply isn't that good. Overly long, vaguely goofy in places, and straining for gravity and dignity, it's the dignity part that is hard.",
            "... Nolan gets the character right: Bruce Wayne is the secret identity and Batman is the real persona.",
            "It's a refreshing approach to the genre, even when revisiting years later, in an era inundated with superhero movies where each tries to better the last's visual effects budget.",
            "Christopher Nolan made something special with his Batman films and it feels like Batman Begins is often overlooked due to the reputation of The Dark Knight. Fans should at least appreciate Batman Begins in a similar light if not a slightly brighter one.",
            "Compared to the flashier Superman, the dark knight was always more human and prone to brooding, but this film is way out of whack."

            "Embara\u00e7osamente infantil, o filme ainda deixa claro que, al\u00e9m da falta de carisma, Bloom \u00e9 um ator inexpressivo que n\u00e3o possui o menor timing c\u00f4mico.",
            "Crowe is still a master navigator of swampy territory, and any movie that can warm the heart and tickle the funny bone without selling its soul is to be cherished, warts and all.",
            "30 seconds in, it lost me. 3 minutes in, it angered me. 13 minutes in, I wanted to start randomly garotting people in the next row. 23 minutes in, I actually tried to. ",
            "With Elizabethtown [Crowe] has made another heartfelt movie shot through with his sensibility. He's also made a gigantic mess, the first directorial misfire in his six-film oeuvre.",
            "I was surprised to find myself strolling along the film's basic plotline, not necessarily bowled over by what I was seeing, but not exactly disliking it either."

            "Funny, bittersweet, its understatement yielding surprising depth charges, Broken Flowers is a triumph of close observation and telling details.",
            "The ending is sublime, a set piece that almost makes up for the overwhelming slightness of it all.",
            "Murray manages, almost impossibly, to come up with still another rich variation on his Depleted Man persona, and his performance is at once enormously generous and fiercely, concisely witty.",
            "Moving, mirthful and minimalist, Broken Flowers is a bittersweet treat from indie great Jim Jarmusch.",
            "There's a real poignancy in watching Murray's emotional chill thaw from the heat generated by even the idea of romance, or at least its more libidinous evil twin, lust.",
            "A very gentle and wry outing for Jarmusch and his star.",
            "One of Jim Jarmusch's finer films.",
            "A movie of wry humor and wry observations.",
            "The film, and its very oxymoronic title, \"Broken Flowers\", acts as a metaphor for the anti-epiphanies that exploring your past can present.",
            "... Broken Flowers, coming from a postcode of its own, doesn't quite deliver.",
            "Murray shows us that what was behind his early-period jaded-hipster shtick was a melancholy and fearful man.",
            "Insightful, entertaining, and a worthy addition to the filmography of one of America's more interesting modern directors.",
            "Throbs with compressed emotion",
            "Murray's performance is a highlight in a very entertaining dramedy.",
            "Funny, disciplined, and acted with great skill and warmth.",
            "Each encounter is a finely observed and beautifully performed vignette in its own right, but together they sketch out a past from which our grey Lothario has been irrevocably set adrift.",
            "Womanizer cads may be front and center in movies. But surprisingly sometimes, so are the impressive accompanying ensemble righteous females who cut them nicely down to size, and the quirky and twisted Broken Flowers is no exception.",
            "The auteur's unbeatable weirdness here mutates into preciosity.",
            "After a career of deadpanning, Murray's impassive performance is still fresh, funny, sympathetic and restrained.",
            "This is a film about insufficiency on so many levels, a film not of hipster indifference, but of a certain effete inability to react.",
            "Subtle, warm direction from Jim Jarmusch and another Oscar-worthy performance from Bill Murray -- will the Academy just give him a statue, already?",
            "It's about questions, not easy answers, and its refusal to provide them might frustrate some viewers unaccustomed to Jarmusch's elliptical style.",
            "In Murray [Jarmusch] has found his quintessential actor."
