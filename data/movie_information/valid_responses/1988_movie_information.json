            "Mostly the film abounds with wit, charm and ingenuity. And above all it abounds with Dustin Hoffman.",
            "Barry Levinson directs in masterful style It is his best effort in what promises to be a distinguished career.",
            "It's Hoffman's most exposed performance in that he must work almost entirely with his character's landlocked interior life.",
            "Everything about the acting and direction of Rain Man is so exquisitely calibrated and so right that it's all too easy to forget how much could have gone wrong.",
            "A fascinating, often very moving, frequently funny film.",
            "It's an honorable effort, touched by a certain lightness and grace.",
            "Boasts exceptional acting, particularly from Hoffman (who is convincing with his idiosyncrasies) and Golino (who exhibits a striking authenticity with her emotional displays).",
            "Garish and superficial.",
            "...wonderful performances make it a memorable trip. Hoffman has by far the juicier role, an opportunity to transform himself almost as radically as he did in Tootsie.",
            "[A] poignant and involving comedy drama.",
            "Rain Man cheers up its audience but avoids sentimentality. Films like that are rare.",
            "A professionally made, commercial film, no doubt, but its secrets can be uncovered with a second viewing. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "Rain Man is a buddy picture with one buddy missing, a road movie without much to see along the way.",
            "The story may be too black for many looking for a light comedy, or entertainment-escape. But it's a film that's haunting in the way it unravels the love at the core of two brothers who discover each other.",
            "The best films are those that manage to generate emotion in their audience without ever feeling phony or melodramatic. Rain Man does exactly that.",
            "While everyone remembers this film about an autistic man as Dustin Hoffman's Oscar-winning triumph, it is equally Tom Cruise's.",
            "Under Barry Levinson's astringent direction, Hoffman and Cruise evoke honestly earned emotions. Don't pass on this wonderfully funny and touching movie. There's magic in it.",
            "When the great screen performances of 1988 are considered for Oscar nomination, expect Hoffman's name on the list.",
            "It has a heart as good as Raymond's own, which is more than a lot of Hollywood movies can say for themselves at the moment.",
            "powerful and evocative",
            "What no one can argue is that Rain Man is Cruise's quantum leap, so that it can be said unblushingly that he holds his own with the masterly Hoffman.",
            "Of course, it's annoying. But it's also funny, touching and true, striking chords without ever reducing Raymond to a performing puppy. Definitely.",
            "The strength of the film is really that of Cruise's performance, his finest since Risky Business.",
            "There's something indelible about Rain Man, and not only to those of us who lived through the time when it was a zeitgeist movie. [Blu-ray]"

            "The interaction between the female leads is so funny that you don't care if the leading man never turns up.",
            "Working Girl, always fun even when at its most frivolous, has the benefit of the cinematographer Michael Ballhaus's sharp visual sense of board room chic, and of supporting characters who help carry its class distinctions beyond simple caricature.",
            "This scrumptious romantic comedy with its blithe cast is as easy to watch as swirling ball gowns and dancing feet. But oh me, oh my, how much more demanding it is to be a fairy tale heroine these days.",
            "A buoyant, emotionally gratifying underdog story, one that manages to be touching despite any of its minor follies",
            "It never tries to be too dark, even though audiences will suspect an appropriately mature resolution for the setup.",

            "Its deft handling of feminist issues make it all the more ironic that it has been dismissed as trivial when in many ways it's the female equivalent of Wall Street.",

            "It deliciously plays out as a modern day corporate Cinderella story for females.",

            "A top-drawer romantic comedy with all the right ingredients in place.",
            "In Mike Nichols' fairy tale about the workforce, Melanie Griffith gives a charming performance as an absued scretary who decides to take charge of her life and in the process also gets the lover of her bitchy boss (well played by Sigourney Weaver).",
            "80s corporate hokum rescued by another very funny turn from Sigourney Weaver.",

            "Waters cultists have ample reason to be wary, but the film retains a surprisingly subversive edge that undercuts its blinding surface gloss.",
            "It's amiable, it's bouncy, it's got a sweet unknown in the lead flanked by a cast of bankable stars and, providing as it does an amiable and bouncy and sweet escape from a summer's worth of clunky blockbusters.",
            "Hairspray is an infectious aerosol comedy with nearly every hair in place.",
            "Marc Shaiman and Chris Wittman's score sparkles and the film's production design and appearance remain faithful to Waters' vision of 1960's Baltimore. ",
            "The latest version is just as good, if not better, with an infectious soundtrack and an all-star cast that precisely hits every note. This is easily the most entertaining major studio release of 2007.",
            "Nikki Blonsky is a complete delight.",
            "The songs by composer Marc Shaiman and lyricist Scott Whitman are big, bold and deliriously infectious, the kind of music that leaves you wanting to stand up and shout, or at least get up and dance.",

            "It pays respect to the original while also carving its own image as a truly good musical.",
            "Much as Hairspray serves as a showcase for the effervescent charms of newcomer Blonsky, its greatest trick is to revitalise the careers of a few old Hollywood faithfuls.",
            "In alchemy the transmuting of materials between forms distills them to their purest elements. In film, the opposite is true. The more iterations, the more muddled things get. Hairspray is good at what it does but not everything it does is good.",
            "The script is full of anachronisms, but Hairspray's sense of history delivers a needed spritz in the face.",
            "Much of the fun comes from director-choreographer Adam Shankman's happy acceptance of musical staples",
            "Shankman's crassly theatrical attenuation of Hairspray only draws gay culture away from a moment of American history with which it ought to have a great deal in common",
            "It falls to individual efforts by the cast to keep the eye and ear coming back for more.",
            "Hairspray is an energetic romp, but as a social statement -- which it pretends to be -- it's cartoonish. And as a playful look back at a time and place, it's simplistic shtik. It's a mountain of whipped cream, with an occasional chocolate sprinkle.",
            "I will confess that Travolta totally turned me around. A mountain of a woman in his female fat suit, he commits 150% to the role.",

            "Most of ''The Land Before Time'' is so authentically geared to the thinking of children that it should charm adults as well.",
            "It is really only of interest to very young children, but at the same time it is debatable whether or not it is suited to them.",
            "A really sweet little... hero's journey for little children.",
            "With animation that is beautifully hand-drawn, The Land Before Time manages to hold up at 30 years old.",
            "The animation is fine. But the Stu Krieger screenplay contains violence that might be hard on the younger ones, preachiness that's hell on adults and a never-let-up cuteness that can turn minds of all ages to mush.",
            "Sharp animation and powerful visualisation of scale will enthrall a young audience but the clumsy cub-scout moralising feels, well, extinct.",
            "If your little dinosaur lovers are still a bit young for Jurassic Park, then this charming cartoon should have them in raptures.",
            "It's a beautiful movie to watch, and the cartoony characters are as endearing as they come.",
            "The Land Before Time works by evoking the simple virtues of this art aimed at children, as it was in the beginning when Disney animated Mickey Mouse. This film deserves a place next to the often-revived animated classics.",
            "A gorgeous production from beginning to end, The Land Before Time contains all the essential elements missing from most of Disney's recent efforts.",
            "Maintains a genuine sense of beauty to it that will appeal to its young audience.",
            "Baby dinosaur buddy flick that started the series.",
            "What charmed me when I first saw it as a six-year-old in theaters now strikes me as rather middling, indifferent storytelling and character development."

            "The tone of Eight Men Out is reminiscent of the droll irony of John Huston's considerations of the vanity of human wishes and the corrupting power of money.",
            "It's a period re-created with a whoosh of energy and a redeeming vein of irony.",
            "The ensemble performances are of such a uniformly high caliber that our interest in the story never wavers.",
            "Eight Men Out never gathers much authority; the old themes have been hung on a rickety structure that constantly threatens to collapse.",
            "In an ensemble movie like this one, an actor who grabs too much of the limelight can throw everything out of focus. The cast Sayles has assembled understands the value of teamwork.",
            "Sayles often seems like a man who, trying to stretch a single, gets caught between bases and is desperately trying to evade the rundown.",
            "Robert Richardson, who'd go on to shoot nearly all of Quentin Tarantino's movies, including \"Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood,\" crafts compelling visuals, and Sayles' writing, as always, is major league.",
            "Although Eight Men Out is a serious, sober effort... I found it neither clumsy nor doctrinaire.",
            "Aside from its moving study of greed, corruption and loss, the film provides a wonderful glimpse at life inthe post-World War I era.",
            "The light shed on this dark period of sports history makes Eight Men Out essential moviegoing. But what makes it heartbreaking is watching the toll taken on champions betraying their talent on a field of honor.",
            "Unfortunately, the movie's didacticism returns in the lengthy and somewhat tedious courtroom ending dealing with the aftermath of the Series.",
            "It's a sad and compelling piece that is totally convincing and doesn't require a knowledge of baseball.",
            "Does a fine job in getting to the details of the baseball scandal.",
            "Sayles deftly re-creates the forces that drove men at top of their class on the diamond to take bribes: big-time crime in Chicago and heartless management in the head office.",
            "The story is lumpy in spots, but fine performances and expressive camera work carry the day.",
            "A treat for baseball fans but might bore others.",
            "In 1988, writer-director John Sayles made his most ambitious film to date with this intelligent chronicle of the 1919 sports scandal, cast with some of the best actors around (Strathairn, Cusack, Sweeney, Sheen).",
            "Sayles' excellent film is more of a human tragedy than a sports movie -- meaning that even those with a limited knowledge of baseball should find it fascinating stuff.",
            "Sayles gives the film an intelligent, well-researched, nostalgic tone with plenty of quiet moments to round out the excitement.",
            "Sayles not only depicts the circumstances that led to the fix (most notably Sox owner Charles Comiskey's legendary tightfistedness), but he also re-creates the games in great detail, making the best possible use of an athletic cast.",
            "Perhaps the saddest chapter in the annals of professional American sports is recounted in absorbing fashion in Eight Men Out.",
            "Baseball fans might find this marginally absorbing; for anyone else it's as conscientious and stylistically pedestrian as Sayles's other films, and a mite overlong to boot.",
            "Strong performances help -- especially from David Strathairn -- but it's not the great American sports drama it could have been."

            "Without being sentimental, the drama is incredibly moving as the muted light plays over young faces that are about to face the unknowable evils of the adult world.",
            "Not the director's best work, but far, far from being his worst either.",
            "Breathtakingly good.",
            "An ever-shifting balance of power is the film's greatest strength.",
            "In this frightening and beautiful film, a schoolboy must learn hard lessons early. ",
            "The film's quiet integrity finally depends on his avoidance of heroic clich\u00e9 and stylistic bombast, and on the unindulgent generosity extended towards his characters.",
            "The powerfully moving WWII story of two friends whose innocence is taken away because of the actions of evil men.",
            "In Goodbye, Children, we find the best of French cinema... that realist, almost documentary streak, of people like Renoir. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Without portentousness or pretension, it achieves genuine tragic depth.",
            "There is not a false note in [this] film.",
            "[VIDEO ESSAY] \"Au Revoir Les Enfants\" is a heartbreakingly confessional wartime film made all the more effective by the care with which the subjective story is told. Its sense of loss is profound.",
            "Malle builds Au Revoir Les Enfants out of small but vivid details centred on the life of the boarder, and the daily rituals and routines experienced by Julien Quentin (Gaspard Manesse) and Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejt\u00f6). ",
            "It was a story that, 'kept haunting me all these years,' Malle said, and it's likely to haunt the viewer a little also.",
            "One of Louis Malle's most personal and significant films.",
            "Louis Malle, possibly at his best here. The drama is subtle but affecting.",
            "Malle's approach is perfectly suited to the subject -- not in the least because his deliberate pacing conveys a child's sense of time.",
            "Avoids sentimentality, clich\u00e9s and bombast, as it instead touches the heart in a moving and unforgettable way.",
            "unquestionably Malle's most personal film and arguably his most powerful",
            "As ever, Malle's sensitivity is supreme and his delicate style evocative. [Blu-ray]"

            "The film has a purposefully repellent but fascinating quality. Bogosian`s performance, based on his stage play, is spectacularly demented.",
            "As a director, Stone has a way of merging with the point of view of his protagonists, which is to say that his films are as jittery, wired-up and fragmented as they are.",
            "The overall effect is disturbing yet mesmerizing; most of the movie takes place in the radio studio while the hero is on the air, and the moral questions raised by his incendiary brand of broadcasting are left provocatively open.",
            "Not to put too fine a point on it, Bogosian is prickly, irritable, alienating and overwhelming. Underwhelming, however, is the way that director Oliver Stone has taken monologuist Bogosian's intimate Off-Broadway play and \"opened it up.\"",
            "Oliver Stone's Talk Radio makes you laugh, makes you mad and keeps you edgily watching for the killers in the shadows.",
            "If you think you're unshockable, see this film and then see what you think.",
            "Of all the new movies, Talk Radio aims to be the most controversial. Oddly enough, it is the least interesting-full of sound, fury and insignificance.",
            "Yet despite its faults this is a strikingly intelligent film, which keeps its chilly grip to the end.",
            "[Bogosian gives] a biting, energetic, get-under-your-skin performance -- the daring centerpiece of this impressive, thought-provoking film.",
            "Talk Radio is a powerful movie, but a bit self-defeating in the relentlessness with which it hammers away at its theme.",
            "The monologues are chilling, but too many subplots interfere with them.",
            "Talk Radio is an exhaustively and exhaustingly unpleasant portrait of an unpleasant guy.",
            "Just how far can Barry go? That`s what stupified audiences will begin to wonder at the outset of this riveting drama.",
            "Talk Radio has all the charm of a conversation with Morton Downey Jr. and Geraldo Rivera. It's fascinating without being likable. It's exploitative, mean-spirited and angry... and very compelling.",
            "Powerfully directed by Oliver Stone, whose swirling camera transforms a radio studio into a white-hot caldron of words and emotions.",
            "Stone wants more. In Salvador and Platoon he found drama to match his message; here he must invent tragedy to suit his spleen.",
            "Stone's hyperkinetic direction keeps you riveted. He stalks every move Champlain makes around the studio as he revs up bigots, druggies, sex fiends and religious fanatics whom he then viciously puts down.",
            "An underrated movie, Talk Radio has matured into a strong reflection on the nature of celebrity. Oliver Stone hasn't made many better films.",
            "This gripping picture dating from the time when director Oliver Stone made good films rather than sensational headlines, features a tour-de-force performance from Eric Bogosian. ",
            "Fueled by a brilliant performance from Bogosian, Talk Radio is an intense experience that will leave most audiences feeling drained.",
            "The voice-in-the-dark hysteria comes no less out of Stone, seizing the success d'estime transplant for the personal, even confessional, quandary of the anguished truth-teller in the end engulfed by the system.",
            "Bogosian commands attention in a patented tour-de-force. Supporting performances are all vividly realized, notably Michael Wincott's drug-crazed Champlain fan invited to the studio for a tete-a-tete with the host.",
            "Champlain's distorted perspective is compelling, despite Stone's sometimes flashy direction as he attempts to wrest cinematic qualities out of the essentially stagey material."

            "Perhaps the most unusual aspect of what is surely the year's most original and daring comedy is that John Cleese is not the funniest performer in it. Believe it or not, that honor goes to none other than the usually somber Kevin Kline.",
            "Somehow, the movie manages to do the impossible: It makes John Cleese less than hilarious.",
            "Low comedy at high speed, it pretends to be a caper movie about a smooth London jewel heist and its infinitely complex aftermath. Actually, it's a smart farce about ingrained cultural differences.",
            "The movie's basic joke holds that the overbearing, unselfconscious Americans will do anything and say anything (and usually as loudly as possible), while the timorous British are nearly too polite to breathe.",
            "Wanda defies gravity, in both senses of the word, and redefines a great comic tradition.",
            "Like many of the best English comedies, much of the humor here is based on character, good-natured high spirits, and fairly uninhibited vulgarity.",
            "It's almost as if each antihero is competing to be the most despicable of the lot.",
            "If anything, what Cleese and director Charles Crichton celebrate with A Fish Called Wanda is the art of the ensemble. Getting the pieces together is difficult, but when it works, it's a masterpiece.",
            "There are certainly plenty of elements within A Fish Called Wanda that work exceedingly well...",
            "A nutty caper film that is sometimes riotous, sometimes romantic, and sometimes merely confused.",
            "To those who appreciate Ealing comedy (which is to say all right-thinking people), watching the film is like chancing on a Hogarth sketch in grandmother's attic, clearly and unmistakably signed by the Master.",
            "In the Monty Python tradition, the script is an assembly of skitlike situations cobbled into a flimsy story. The humor is cruel and at times wildly funny.",
            "The antics alone are fun to watch, but the dialogue is priceless, and there's never been such a hilarious blend of American and British humor.",
            "The key to Wanda's comedy is the ever-shifting loyalties of its four nutty main characters.",
            "A Fish Called Wanda is vintage black comedy, British-style -- a cruel, dastardly, down-and-dirty jewel-robbery romp that pits thief against thief, while entangling an innocent bystander in the web of greed, romance and decidedly cockeyed high jinks.",
            "Cleese's cracking script gives it a solid foundation, but it's the supporting cast who make this movie wanda-ful.",
            "Putting heart and heat into a film that could have easily slid by on silliness, Cleese proves himself a master actor.",
            "As in most of his Python parts... Cleese's character is an extended riff on the concept of pomposity. But Archie is more leavened with humanity than any of his other roles.",
            "This hilarious tale of criminal incompetence and transatlantic eccentricity is easily John Cleese's finest achievement since Fawlty Towers.",
            "There are a few hilarious moments, and a few more that are foolish and even disgusting.",
            "A Fish Called Wanda is at its most electric when it pits Cleese and Kline against each other.",
            "Kevin Kline won the Supporting Actor Oscar for this funny and enjoyable farce, based on original script by John Cleese and Charles Crichton",
            "Crime caper with a wicked edge. Not for kids.",
            "Wacky farcical entertainment."

            "At last American cinema has done black music proud. Unforgettable.",
            "Bird is less moving as a character study than it is as a tribute and as a labor of love. The portrait it offers, though hazy at times, is one Charlie Parker's admirers will recognize.",
            "Whitaker sweats, vomits, blows and wails as the Bird (so named for hanging around jazz clubs like a yardbird), laying in some minor-key grace to Parker's self-destruction along the way. But he never lets you into his darkest fears.",
            "Whitaker occupies this world as a large, friendly, sometimes taciturn man who tries to harm nobody and who cannot understand why the world would not let him play his music. Neither can we.",
            "It is only thanks to Whitaker's performance, which won him a Golden Globe, that we are truly able to bond with Bird and truly care about his lifelong challenges. ",
            "Eastwood directed Bird in much the same way he plays jazz piano-not with caution, not with precision, but with a love that is supreme.",
            "What the film pulls off is the difficult fusion of this kind of accuracy with larger 'truths' which are no respecter of accuracy.",
            "\"Bird'' is a movie that demands your full attention, refusing to yield all its meanings if you sit back and let it wash over you.",
            "The greatest strength of Clint Eastwood's bio-pic tribute to jazz saxophone great Charlie 'Bird' Parker, is its dark and haunting mood.",

            "Much to Nair`s credit, she exploits neither the exoticism of her locale (there are no tour-guide, look-at-this flourishes) nor the misery of her subjects (suffer they may, but they do not demand pity).",
            "Director Mira Nair, trained in America, is very much in control of her material, tells her story efficiently and has most of the cast, none of them real professionals, under total control.",

            "The movie is terrifically well acted and beautifully filmed, however, marking an auspicious feature-film debut for Indian-American director Mira Nair.",
            "Dispossession and despair are seldom portrayed with such force on-screen. Director Mira Nair has done a masterful job of underscoring a social problem that has repercussions far beyond the Third World.",

            "Very sad, but powerfully moving.",
            "Dickensian in its empathy with the poor, uncompromising in its realism and ambitious in both scope and technique, this debut feature from Mira Nair is one of the most arresting studies of street life ever made.",
            "honest and haunting portrait",
            "Nair's debut, winner of Cannes Festival Camera d'Or, tells the harrowing story of one boy's life among thieves, prostitutes and drug dealers. Though inspired by De Sica, Babenco, and Ray, it acheves distinctive intensity and color from its unique locale",

            "Nair leavens her story of a desperately impoverished 11-year-old (Shafiq Syed) with enough sentimentality to insure broad audience appeal.",
            "Mira Nair's feature debut is a moving and powerful look at people for whom survival itself is a major achievement.",
            "Despite the grim setting, the colours are disarmingly sumptuous, the Bollywood lushness conflicting with the downbeat subject matter but ultimately ideal for the film's melodramatic tone."

            " Von Sydow towers above the rest of the cast with an immensely moving, tender depiction of a man cowed by age and servitude.",
            "Von Sydow was better in Strange Brew, but still rather sweet.",
            "A vividly re-created, minutely detailed panorama of a particular time (the turn of the century), place (rural Denmark) and circumstance (life on a great farm) in the course of the four seasons.",

            "Sometimes emotionally disengaging, but generally an intelligent Bergman-esque study of one woman's quest for fulfillment.",

            "It would be hard to improve upon the classic, after all, and Scrooged not only sticks to the Dickens plot, but makes it believable as a modern fable. But the more difficult part of Scrooged is its modernization, the colorization of Dickens, if you will.",

            "Really pleasantly surprised by it... it's just a fun, weird. movie.",
            "What's so wonderful about Russell's quintessential female villain is that she embodies a sense that evil has no gender. It has no feelings. It simply is, and it's quite fun to get to know it.",
            "Despite starring Hugh Grant and Peter Capaldi (in a kilt), it is Amanda Donohoe that steals the film. She stars as Lady Slyvia Marsh, our seductress snake-vampire villainess, who brings a wry humour and a bounty of sensuality to the film. ",
            "If you're a Russell fan you should know what you're in for and, overall, it's a well-constructed, entertaining film.",
            "More pantomime than horror, Ken Russell's unsurprisingly outrageous romp exposes conflicting substrates of British identity.",
            "A totally strange, gore-drenched horror/comedy about ancient pagan rituals that leaves you with only one certain thought in your head: that Ken Russell is one very bent fellow.",
            "Fun-filled, oddball British vampire flick",
            "Gleefully over the top - Ken Russell's last good movie.",
            "Equal parts awful and hypnotic",
            "Effective, unique horror movie.",
            "Christianity and paganism clash in Ken Russell's campy The Lair of the White Worm.",
            "An almost perfect savvy blend of horror and comedy that both honors the horror genre while standing it on its head.",
            "One of the worst films I've ever seen."

            "More than a technological wonder, Who Framed Roger Rabbit? is brilliantly funny, bracingly smart and surprisingly moving.",

            "It holds up very well today.",
            "Directed by 'Robert Zemeckis, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a murder mystery turned on its (very long rabbit) ears, and a spirited tribute to the magic of animation and laughter.",

            "It took many, many years before I fully processed just how impressive a technical feat Who Framed Roger Rabbit actually is.",
            "An ingenious blend of hand-drawn animation and live action, spliced with humour that's by turns madcap, surreal and violent, Roger Rabbit demonstrates that it's possible to push the technical boundaries while still cooking up decent characters and plots.",
            "This whizz-bang breakthrough in mixing live action with cartoon characters won a special achievement Oscar for animator Richard Williams.",
            "Motion pictures may never be the same again, now that the fascinating and utterly miraculous Who Framed Roger Rabbit has come to the screen.",
            "The feats performed by director Robert Zemeckis and director of animation Richard Williams are pretty amazing.",

            "For sheer movie excitement, this is the easy winner so far this season.",
            "The best film directed by Zemeckis; the best of the many great high-concept '80s popcorn-comedies; the best American film of 1988.",
            "Deceptively adult movie is fun, but not for kids.",
            "The combination detective noir story, slightly adult humour, crazy toon characters from both Warner & Disney's vaults (a one-off which is unlikely to ever repeat) and overall technical wizardy yielded a film which set a precedent.",

            "It is so pleasant and unpretentious that we can almost forget the total lack of surprise in this deftly acted Australian film.",
            "This isn't an adolescent wish-fulfillment fantasy, so the impossible never happens, and it's a credit to the movie that it doesn't.",
            "Although most of this is rather familiar stuff...the treatment is sufficiently sincere and nuanced to give it a touch of poignancy.",
            "The ending carries a tidal surge of regret for youthful emotional loss that will no doubt be universal.",
            "This funny, touching, truthful gem of a film is one of the ongoing pleasures of Australian cinema, and is as fresh and compelling on its 21st anniversary as it was on its acclaimed release",
            "Though it covers familiar territory, this well-acted, skillfully photographed film is a gentle examination of the rites of passage.",
            "Wonderful, perceptive, and original Australian film about the magic and anguish of adolescence.",
            "Duigan's gift for characterization and feel for period give the film its haunting and evocative mood, and hint at something altogether darker than the average teen flick.",
            "Bittersweet Australian coming-of-age tale",
            "It's solid, involving and uncomfortably familiar -- another good, but not great, coming-of-age drama.",
            "Nice effort from Duigan, and a smashing introduction by Noah Taylor, who would fly so high in Shine."

            "Alm\u00f3dovar unfolds this convoluted plot with zig-zagging surrealism and a careening, sordidly erotic energy that effectively undermines the culturally institutionalized repression targeted by the filmmaker. ",
            "If Blue Velvet raised eyebrows, Matador will have some moviegoers blinking in disbelief.",
            "One of Almodovar's better features, although, like many of the others, it partially plays the role of popularizing stronger stuff, and resorts to some contrived plot devices in order to fuse its diverse story elements.",
            "Not so much a maelstrom as a mess of contrived eroticism, pretentious dialogue, and voyeuristic sensationalism, Almod\u00f3var's silly, cod-philosophical whodunit impresses only for its bravado.",
            "For all its jolts and bizarre flights of fancy, Matador is a marvelously fluid and darkly sensual film in which Almodovar elicits exquisitely controlled performances.",
            "It's a useful look at this Spanish auteur finding his way but lacks the elan of his later work.",
            "The film is fiercely funny, executed in a reckless, raucous rage by the most wantonly gifted new filmmaker on the international scene. Alm\u00f3dovar relishes mocking his country's sacred cows. ",
            "Almod\u00f3var celebrates the controversial potential of the medium more so than most other directors at work today. His movies get people talking and thinking.",
            "Screamingly funny, intriguing meditation on sex and violence, delving sacrilegiosuly into the Almodovarish underpinnings of that arch Spanish ritual, the bullfight.",
            "Bizarre, funny and unexpected.",
            "Almodovar's early work is saltry, erotic, even perverse, but very seductive to watch",
            "follows a bizarre, but ultimately logical path",
            "The \"prolonged orgasm\" is Almod\u00f3var's format and tenor",
            "Among the most perverse of Almodovar's films, Matador's characters are so desperate to feel alive that death becomes the ultimate turn-on.",
            "fascinating and wonderfully lurid!",
            "The movie looks terrific and is acted with absolute, straight-faced conviction by the excellent cast...",
            "A richly detailed, physically gorgeous movie (Almodovar's most professional-looking work to that time) that almost has too much on its mind.",
            "The sincerity here is of a special cracked sort -- the brand that induces laughter but is undiminished by it.",
            "Murder, mutilation, suicide and rape...[are] just a few of Matador's popcorn-incompatible themes. But [Almodovar] swirls his cape over these chargers so imaginatively, shamelessly and inventively, his flamboyance wins the day."

            "Screwball Annie and hardball Crash aren't playing the same game, which is Shelton's conceit as well as a possible screen-writing miscalculation.",
            "Ron Shelton, who wrote and directed the film, displays a knowledge of and affection for the national pastime. You can see it in the knowing detail he brings to even the minor characters.",
            "[Shelton is] uncanny at putting us inside his players' heads when they're on the mound or up at bat, running their private litanies of encouragement and subversion to psych themselves up.",
            "Rather than a vapid national epic, it is a warm, droll, deftly cracked romantic comedy.",
            "The acting in Bull Durham cannot be faulted and should be remembered at Oscar time. Sarandon has one of the juiciest female roles in years and she makes you think no one could play it better.",
            "Shelton locates the tension and the humor between pitches, between ball games, between the sheets. It helps too that he has written the wittiest, busiest screenplay since Moonstruck, and that his three stars do their very best screen work.",
            "Writer/Director Ron Shelton clearly knows what he's doing here.",
            "Down-to-earth personalities and the honest, simple, funny dialogue are spot-on.",
            "You 'd never find similar scenes to \"Bull Durham\" in, say, Europe, and not because they don't have our national pastime; they're just too sensible. You simply have to love America to be able to revel in our delightful, deep state of cultural silliness.",
            "Bull Durham puts Shelton in the Hollywood big leagues, and he's hit his very first pitch over the scoreboard in centerfield.",
            "Bull Durham (1988) is a humorous and intelligent romantic sports comedy-drama about a mediocre Carolina minor leagues baseball team - the Durham Bulls, from first-time director Ron Shelton. It is the quintessential modern sports film about America's...",
            "Bull Durham is the greatest baseball film ever made. It captures the essence of the game. It's full of crackling dialogue that is endlessly quotable. It's absolutely hilarious at times and heartbreaking at others.",
            "Is Bull Durham the greatest sports movie ever made? No argument from me.",
            "Writer-director Ron Shelton tells a wonderful story of how a veteran ballplayer and up-and-comer collide in the world of the minor leagues, and how they are loved by a baseball groupie who's also a philosopher and poet.",
            "Does an impressive job picking up the mundane world of bush league baseball in spirit.",
            "It's not just the screenplay, it's the performances and direction that make this film.",
            "Costner is charming as an aging catcher who decides it's time to hang up his mitt at Sarandon's place.",
            "Bull Durham is the feel-good movie of the Summer of '88. The sooner you see it, the happier your summer's going to be. So what are you waiting for?",
            "A smart, witty character piece that eschews the stale sports flick formul",
            "Bull Durham is a jaunty, refreshing comedy that mixes sex The ambling pace and inventiveness of Bull Durham are the doing of Shelton, a filmmaker worth watching. This film is a tidy summing-up of one aspect of America`s favorite sport.",
            "[Crash's] remit? To teach talented but undisciplined pitcher Ebby (Tim Robbins) about hurling a ball. And a little about life.",
            "I will always respect Bull Durham for what it represents in terms of love of baseball, but it will not be on my list of favorite sports movies.",
            "This witty, sharply observed tale belnds sports, comedy and romance and benefits immensely from the appealing performances by Kevin Costner, Susan Sarandon, and Tim Robbins.",
            "A winning, mature comedy about sex and baseball. "

            "Robert Englund, receiving star billing for the first time, is delightful in his frequent incarnations as Freddy, delivering his gag lines with relish and making the grisly proceedings funny.",
            "While some of the monotonous effects are strikingly surreal, Harlin's direction creates an atmosphere which is more morbid than scary.",
            "Though the Elm Street series contains the most intelligent premise in current genre films, none of the movies take much advantage of their potential.",
            "As always, the teen actors are disposable, and even Robert Englund seems to be sleepwalking through Freddy.",
            "The special effects continue to advance, particularly with a creative waterbed sequence, a hilarious human-meatball snack, and increased levels of bloodshed.",
            "This terrible sequel pushed Freddy into a mainstream area that seemed too safe for him to be the Freddy we already missed. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "The lesser of the \"Nightmare\" sequels, but serviceable more surreal one nevertheless...",
            "...an obvious low point within this incredibly uneven series.",
            "Surprisingly watchable for the third sequel and despite its general predictability it's entertainingly inventive.",
            "With each entry, the films become more removed from their source. Freddy just isn't scary anymore.",
            "Not counting 1994's Wes Craven's New Nightmare, it's superior to all the other later sequels in the series.",
            "Fun, but not a shade on the earlier Elm Street flicks",
            "The new comedy version of Freddy...",
            "As the series drags on, the inventiveness of murders decreases slightly but Freddy's humor continues to entertain.",
            "The Dream Master has a sort of constant level of goofy idiocy.",
            "Bottomless grab-bag from the 80s TV subconscious, riffing on Jaws, Karate Kid, and the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, with a palette that would make Joel Schumacher queasy",
            "Renny Harlin's finest moment. That should tell you something.",
            "Not much to see here except for the occasional '80s big hairdo and some decent gore shots.",
            "A good sequel in the series directed by trash auteur Renny Harlin with just the right flair."

            "Scary, yet darkly funny, this thriller of the supernatural from the director of the terrific \"Fright Night\" moves with the speed of a bullet train and with style to burn.",
            "The sequences without Chucky are as stock as they come, and so are all the flesh-and-blood characters around him, but he's still a hugely entertaining mischief-maker, and what he lacks in physical gifts, he compensates for in sneakiness.",
            "Making a good horror-thriller, or even a good horror-comedy, is not child's play, as this schizoid film all too unfortunately proves.",
            "Fun withers in stretching the thin material to feature length.",
            "A perfect character design gives Chucky that fiendishly creepy edge, along with drastically changing facial features that accommodate scarier expressions.",
            "This is about a random target's struggle to survive a predicament nobody will ever believe. That sense of isolation and futility easily overshadows any remnants of allegory still present.",
            "Unfortunately, the screenplay by Don Mancini and John Lafia is so predictable, that the jump-out-of-your-seat shocks are telegraphed far in advance.",
            "A steady stream of standard scares is dragged from a thinly stretched, formula slasher plot, thanks to panache beyond the call of duty from director Tom Holland.",
            "There is definitely some silly stuff in this movie - when you're dealing with a two foot tall killer, it's hard to take things seriously... However, the movie's ace in the hole was Chucky himself.",
            "The heart of the movie remains the bond between mother and child during a time of crisis, but the crisis in question is rendered with an incredible finesse...",
            "Child's Play upends all conventions. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "The totality of the film got inside my head and never left.",
            "When the doll begins not just talking - with the excellent, near-iconic voice of Brad Dourif in his mouth - but sneering, snarling and stabbing, it's an excellent reveal.",
            "In short, it is a title... whose plot idea was worthy of greater efforts. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Chucky's back and Scream brought the mass-murdering doll back to the small screen with their Collector's Edition of CHILD'S PLAY, stuffed with all the extra features you would kill for.",
            "The Child's Play series kicks off with this alternatingly silly and frightening installment...",
            "With equal portions of frolic and fear, Child's Play is a hilarious hair-raiser that is highly recommended for horror fans.",
            "It's no surprise that this strange, unique, demented picture spawned a whole series of follow-ups; it's just a shame their increasing gaucheness mostly deters people - including myself - from going back to where it all began.",
            "Never really amounts to a great horror movie.",
            "The things that redeem the film, at least slightly, are Dourif's nasty, insinuating vocal performance and Kevin Yagher's design of the Chucky doll itself.",
            "It's nothing wildly original, but it is pacey and entertaining when it gets going.",
            "It does, however, have some decent scares, a lot of good lines and a memorable villain."

            "A wonderfully crafted, absolutely charming remake of the 1964 film Bedtime Story.",
            "There's little enough to keep you occupied as Caine and Martin go through their comic set pieces in workaday fashion while the film moves mechanically from one contrived situation to the next.",

            "There is a slightly perfunctory air in the way the story unreels as though it's all been done before. Nevertheless, Caine and Martin make a great double act.",
            "Martin, the most eloquent of physical clowns -- the Baryshnikov of comedy -- is at his most inspired here. He parodies feelings, attitudes, states of mind that one would think were exempt from it, and his caricature of dapper suavity is killingly precise.",
            "All these years later Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is still a practically perfect comedy, brimming from scene to scene with outrageous behavior amidst the gorgeous scenery of the French Riviera.",

            "Pfeiffer is at her best, and there's plenty of action, although you may feel that some of the gags involving a scorned and vengeful wife (Mercedes Ruehl) are a bit shopworn.",
            "The enormous cast is a total delight, starting with Pfeiffer, with hair dyed dark, a New York accent and a continuously nervous edge.",
            "Amazingly, for all its hip anarchy, it's finally an oddly old-fashioned slice of entertainment. Preston Sturges might have approved.",
            "Miss Pfeiffer, who looks utterly ravishing in outfits that set the teeth on edge, turns Angela's plight into something funny, but she seems eminently sane even when the movie does not.",
            "Demme sees corruption-the potential for it and the indulgence of it-in everyone. Yet he doesn't neglect the humanity of the people in thrall to or trapped within those systems.",
            "It's a tonal gymnastics display that doesn't come around very often, making \"Married to the Mob\" special, assisted in great part by Demme's askew vision for this type of story.",
            "It's good for a few chuckles, but no real laughs, and the predictable plot is not very compelling.",
            "\"Married to the Mob'' isn't for all tastes. But for cinematic thrills and spills, it's quite a ride.",
            "The cast is superb - especially Mercedes Ruehl in over-the-top mode as Stockwell's brassy, jealous wife - and Demme keeps both the action and the laughs perfectly tuned.",
            "High-spirited and hilarious, Mob supplies that special kick you get from movie comedy when laughter bubbles over into bliss.",
            "Demme's narrative has all the frantic intensity of a nightmare which with its constant shifts of pace and mood works beautifully both as a thriller and as comedy.",
            "...a top-tier '80s comedy.",
            "If you're in the mood for mafia comedy with laughs and a rebellious women's viewpoint, check out Married to the Mob on tape or cable.",
            "This is gangster life played for screwball comedy but the culture isn't all that different than what Martin Scorsese would present in Goodfellas just a couple of years later, right down to the colorful names like Vinnie The Slug...",
            "Married to the Mob is full of promise, but goes nowhere, apparently satisfied enough with being avant-garde and hip.",
            "Offbeat genial suburban gangster comedy delightfully directed by Jonathan Demme.",
            "A gangster film with a twist and the idiosyncratic Demme touch.",

            "Elevator to the Gallows married a new kind of jazz to a new kind of cinema, and created something altogether sublime.",
            "The film's alchemic blend of Bressonian rigor, Hitchcockian suspense, and overall proto-Nouvelle Vague cool more than compensates for its straightforward plotting ...",
            "Lift to the Scaffold (Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud) was the perfect opening to the French New Wave in 1958, sashaying in to a jazz score from Miles Davis and starring Jeanne Moreau as a mistress-in-peril.",
            "Louis Malle's supremely stylish New Wave thriller combines Miles Davis's music, Henri Decae's wonderfully evocative black-and-white cinematography of Paris and plenty of close-ups of a young Jeanne Moreau looking very anguished.",
            "It's a compelling but gangly first film, with a few head-scratching plot holes, but those complaints seem insignificant in the glare of the Paris lights, the flare in Jeanne Moreau's eyes and the blare of Miles Davis' trumpet.",
            "Malle spins new webs around typical noir conventions, giving darker implications of fate and comeuppance a fresh verve.",
            "The experiencing of watching Malle's 1958 debut is akin to that of watching a preordained outcome, much like an academic thesis, work itself out, with much of the suspense residing all in the journey rather than the destination.",
            "Malle made his feature directorial debut with this assured thriller, which recalled both the poetic realism of Marcel Carn\u00e9 and the brooding menace of American films noirs.",
            "Striking to look at, with each frame resembling an intricately designed photograph ...",
            "The ambition is bracing, but critical hindsight obscures how exciting Malle's noir thriller is on its own terms.",
            "What a supremely stylish and watchable picture it is.",
            "Few debuts come punchier, cooler, and more influential than Louis Malle's 1958 thriller about a Parisian murder plan unravelling, scene by fateful scene.",
            "Its constituent parts are great, but just don't come together to make a coherent and satisfying movie.",
            "Louis Malle's brilliant feature directorial debut is a stylish film noir, boasting great jazz score and impressive performance from the young Jeanne Moreau.",
            "the score by Miles is a remarkable one, tapping into the jazzy zeitgeist of the time",
            "Efficient but soulless.",
            "Elevator to the Gallows is a treat for the film buff. Watching Moreau and Malle as they discover each other and a new trend in filmmaking, and listening to Miles Davis during their quest will remind you of what movies are all about.",
            "It's devilishly clever, bleakly hilarious, and fatalistically romantic throughout, a celebration of grand, doomed gestures made for the sake of making them.",
            "Made almost 50 years ago, the black-and-white French classic still grabs you by the throat.",
            "Director-writer Louis Malle's first feature at 26 is a stylish French New Wave noir-ish thriller that never satisfies as much as it should."

            "So very little works in She's Having a Baby that it's easiest just to grouse on how petty and little-minded and pro-conformity it is.",
            "In the lead role, Kevin Bacon is enthusiastic and believable, but even his energy can't carry what boils down to a fairly limp story.",
            "A rare failure from filmmaker John Hughes...",
            "Taking his erstwhile teen lovers into young adulthood, marriage and parenthood, John Hughes fashions a curiously disaffected portrait of the artist as a frustrated chauvinist."

            "A delightful comedy-fantasy.",
            "Penny Marshall brings a logic to the premise that is sustained through most of the movie. And where the other movies snickered at the sexual possibilities in the idea, she faces up to them with both candor and taste.",
            "Oh, this movie. It's not sad, but it makes me tear up every single time without fail. It's delightfully 80s and Tom Hanks is an adorable heartbreaker.",
            "What makes this all work, of course, is Hanks himself, who brings remarkable authenticity and simplicity to the role. He makes being a kid seem as wonderful as it was, and as scary and as confusing too.",
            "Hanks, as a stranger in a strange land, gives us equal portions of laughs and insights into the worlds of both adults and adolescents. Big also offers up a very funny satire of corporate ladder climbing.",
            "Big may well be a formula fantasy movie, but Penny Marshall's polished direction combined with Hanks's gauche charm make it the best of the spate of body-swap movies turned out by Hollywood in the late 1980s.",

            "Big, which has been directed by Penny Marshall with verve and impeccable judgment, drops a child's innocence into the corporate rat race as if it were a depth charge.",
            "When Marshall brings Hanks and Perkins together, she discovers a grace and lightness in their relationship that transcends the pinched thematics of the script.",

            "The whole film, which is very long and demands an effort of attention from its audience, is uneven, and too grand in concept to pay heed to the canons of good taste.",
            "Martin Scorsese's most provocative film also turns out to be uncomfortably slow-paced and sluggish.",
            "It is better to trust the visual narrative in this movie than the dialogue, since the visual scenes are so often taken from the rich iconography of Christ's life as envisioned by artists who came to their task with skills greater than those of Kazantzakis",

            "All the characters in the film speak as people in today's modern society speak, and I would argue that's one of the things that make The Last Temptation of Christ so approachable.",
            "Quietly radical and deeply inspiring . . . thanks to a fervid commitment by Willem Dafoe as Jesus, a swirling, cross-cultural score from Peter Gabriel and some thrilling interpretations of the Bible. The ending is a rare moment of transcendence on film.",
            "Go on, give in to temptation.",
            "Despite moments of power and beauty, Scorsese's controversial film is flawed largely due to its casting, anachronistic dialogue, and blend of acting styles; yet it's a typical Scorsese film, dealing with sin, guilt, and redemption",
            "A bold and imaginative portrait of the life of Jesus of Nazareth and his struggles.",
            "Scorsese's film is a work of passion and faith, and admirable for the way it fearlessly explores its themes, disregarding canonical dogma in search of human truth.",

            "Neither the acting nor direction is particularly creditable.",
            "Arriving from outer space (for which read Russia), a large ball of interstellar snot terrorises a small American town by eating everything in sight.",
            "Unfortunately, [Harris's] picture talks itself to death, even with the blob nibbling away at everybody in sight. And most of his trick effects, under the direction of Irvin S. Yeaworth Jr., look pretty phony.",
            "A hungry glob of protoplasm from outer space goes on a rampage in this cretinous thriller, which has a totally undeserved reputation as a horror classic.",
            "...there's something charming about it, as if all the tacky aspects of the 1950s (and again, I'm talking about the white, squeaky clean, small town 1950s) were distilled into a fast-moving 86 minutes.",
            "One of the most personable sci-fi horror films of its generation.",
            "It's exuberant and extraordinary, and just nasty enough.",
            "The Blob is one of those B-movies that will always inhabit a warm little nook in the affections of SF fans but, truth be told, it's never quite as fun as it should be. ",
            "Rebel Without a Cause for the matinee monster crowd.",
            "A surprisingly smart piece of 50&#8242;s camp.",
            "Bad, but never painfully so . . .",
            "oh-no, not jello, NOT JELLO!",
            "The perfect 'B' horror movie.",
            "Semi-classic 50s sci-fi thanks to McQueen and above par script."
