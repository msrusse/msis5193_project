            "What began as a thrilling and engrossing entertainer ends up as a terribly tedious franchisee -- the convoluted plot leaves you more confused than involved.",
            "Buoyed by luck, comedy and state-of-the-art special effects, it has not only survived the journey intact, it's also washed down its decks, ready for a whole new cycle of movies to begin.",
            "It's a knockabout, scattershot affair.",
            "World's End is duller than a Disneyland ride during a power cut.",
            "The unfunny doppelg\u00e4ngers only remind us, unfortunately, of how formulaic and mechanical this once inspired turn has become.",
            "Advice to Johnny Depp fans: enjoy a seafood dinner, skip the beginning, and roll up after half an hour. You won't have missed a thing.",
            "An epic finale, this overlong, overstuffed film manages to neatly resolve all the loose ends from the previous entry, even if it takes considerable time to do so.",
            "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is marginally more coherent than last year's sequel-a very small mercy. It is, however, just as bloated, requiring a level of familiarity with both its predecessors.",
            "At World's End is nearly three hours long, so it does feel a little padded, but for the most part the film moves at a reasonable pace - even if it almost stumbles to the finish while trying to tie up all the loose ends.",
            "Poised to bring in enough pirate booty to break the $1 billion box office barrier, from the end of the world to your town, set sail for Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. Yo ho, yo ho. It's a pirates life for me!!",
            "The buccaneers have charisma. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Overlong (it clocks in at 168 minutes, just shy of three hours long) and too frightfully busy to retain the nimble qualities of the original.",
            "But even spectacles have their limits. Eventually there has to be substance to go with all that style, and that's where \"At World's End\" falls short.",
            "I found it an improvement over Dead Man's Chest but just barely.",
            "A pirate's appeal is based in large part on his status as a renegade. But Verbinski gives us pirate codes, law books, and congresses-hardly the stuff of swashbuckling lore.",
            "The movie ends up like Davy Jones himself -- many-tentacled, full of bluster, and devoid of a beating heart.",
            "As epic summer movies go, At World's End was pretty good. But don't try to make sense of anything, or you may suffer an aneurysm.",
            "Just how much are you willing to forgive Johnny Depp and that sea-dog swagger of his?",
            "While it fails in matching the unpredictable excitement of the original, this is more of what I'd want in Pirates sequels. Just a little less of it.",
            "If nothing else, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End's ambition and moral ambiguity still set it apart from the pack, but as a send off to the trilogy it staggers across the finish line more than winning out right.",
            "Another piddling blockbuster with delusions of 'darkness'",
            "[Verbinski] borrows from a half-dozen mythologies to construct a fitting punishment for the culture of narcissism, compulsive consumption, and greed that makes movies like this one necessary."

            "By no means great art, but it most certainly is fantastic trash.",
            "A highly stylised fantasy, its colour palette both lush and gloomy. Leonidas is inspiring and practical and as usual when Butler's playing someone who isn't from Scotland, 50% Scottish. Headey is terrific, put her in charge of the Ancient World right now.",
            "What's really striking about the film is that it doesn't even have the aesthetics of a comic book, to say nothing of a graphic novel-the best examples of which, at least, show considerable concern for subtle narrative rhythms.",
            "If you're in the mood for dumb, rousing, visceral excitement, you're not going to find anything on the big screen right now to rival it.",
            "There is an intelligent movie to be made about Spartan warrior culture, but 300 is not it. It is a fun ride, though, as long as you don't see it on a full stomach.",
            "Our instinctual desire to sneer at the implausibility of the story is stalled by a sense of ambition that seems unmatched even by the standards of the Hollywood assembly line.",
            "So manly it makes Troy look like a Mary-Kate and Ashley adventure.",
            "Wallowing in the same adolescent nihilism as his Sin City, this adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel suffers from a similar lack of momentum.",
            "As the first blockbuster of the year, 300 sets the bar high enough, and is enjoyably silly.",

            "Enjoyable, slow-burning thriller with an intelligent script and strong performances from its two leads.",

            "Slow-burning and sombre, Breach won't be for everyone. But it's worth catching for Cooper's performance, while its fact-based tale of treachery will strike a chord in today's climate of suspicion.",
            "Despite a career-best turn from Chris Cooper, however, Breach is a weirdly muted affair.",
            "Cold and cerebral, with simmering suspense rather than outright excitement, this is a feel-the-quality-of-the-acting movie. It can't answer all sorts of questions, but does take a scary mug shot of a subtle monster."

            "There are worse ways to spend an hour and a half than staring mindlessly at a movie's impossibly beautiful cast, but there are plenty of better ones as well.",
            "The Invasion is the fourth and most recent big screen adaptation of Jack Finney's 1955 science fiction novel The Body Snatchers, and hopefully it will be the last.",
            "Fails to live up to its own aspirations, undermined by misguided attempts to enliven the action with car wrecks and explosions.",

            "The incredibly erratic structure - undoubtedly a result of the notorious reshoots - ultimately dulls the impact of the movie's overtly effective attributes..."

            "If other countries can provide their people with universal health care, why can't we? If we can't, who are we?",
            "Moore has again made a film which, though basically sound in logic, sugars the pill in a way which seems suspect in its determination to suggest that, as far as healthcare is concerned, America is bad and everywhere else is good.",
            "A devastating exposure of America's iniquitous healthcare system, coolly marshalled and amusingly detailed by Moore.",
            "In Sicko, Michael Moore's irreverent comedy has become less bleating and more purposeful, perhaps in part because the times we live in have become more desperate.",
            "For the most part, this is a more restrained Moore and the result is another solid documentary that cements Moore's status as a filmmaker capable of making an audience laugh and think at the same time.",
            "The first line of attack exemplifies Moore at his maverick best... Less interesting or sustained are his rose-tinted views of European health service systems. ",
            "Sicko offers still plenty to get riled up about, but the firebrand ire of Fahrenheit 9/11 seems to have mellowed a little.",
            "While Moore's sins aren't nearly as terrible or significant as those of the political system to which he stands opposed, his unabashed tendency to talk down to his audience is symptomatic of our culture of mediocrity.",
            "Equal parts laugh-riot and call to arms.",
            "In trying to decipher how Michael Moore has achieved his widespread popularity in the face of a somewhat cavalier attitude toward factual precision, there's no underestimating his savvy choice of targets.",
            "Though his politics are unmistakably left, the documentarian's targets are almost exclusively the powerful and his work is fueled by optimism rather than cynicism.",
            "More humble than Fahrenheit 9/11 and as enthralling as Bowling For Columbine, Sicko is another target hit square on the nose for America's premier documentalist.",
            "Soon we realize that Sicko hinges not on what Michael Moore is uncovering, but on what he's hiding. This is a real shame as he's a talented documentary maker.",
            "While much of Sicko is certainly propaganda, that should not deter anyone from seeing it or giving some credence to what Moore is saying, because what he is talking about is very real and very important.",
            "Saddening while it still bristles with satire, \"Sicko\" does dodge some of the larger political questions about healthcare reform. Plus, the Cuba stunt mars what is, up to that point, a relatively stunt-free film.",
            "Moore depoliticizes the health care crisis by humanizing it, and drops the polemic in favor of a plea: for us to care about each other a little more.",

            "Wilson shines as the oldest brother of three in perhaps his best performance to date.",
            "It's very much what I think Anderson intended - a light travelogue of small consequence, with a slight, though sincere and concerned effort to bring a heart back into his films.",
            "The screenplay does have ambitions to say something about brotherhood and spirituality, but Anderson's sense of style is so strong that sincerity and emotion struggle to be heard.",
            "Anderson's gentle parody of westerners who lob into an ancient culture expecting to pick up enlightenment and peace as easily as a shoe shine or over-the-counter painkillers is very funny.",
            "By now, you know exactly what to expect, which is both good and bad. To my mind, Anderson reached the acme of this formula in the first go, in Tenenbaums, and has now replicated it twice, evoking smaller pleasures each time.",

            "This inspired-by-reality tale is essentially an emotional snuff film. It's the kind of misguided effort a middle-aged director indulges in when he wants to reinvent himself as edgy. ",
            "Cassavetes' film is pure Hollywood fiction and sensationalism mixed with some sense of reality, but hell I enjoyed it a great deal...",

            "Emotionally engaging, impressively directed and frequently tense drama with strong performances from a terrific ensemble cast.",

            "Though Cartagena in the late 19th Century is beautifully evoked in director Mike Newell's visually sumptuous film, there's something missing at the core of this love story.",
            "If further proof were needed of my dispiriting theory that the best novels rarely make the best films, it is to be found, richly scented and sumptuously packaged, in Love in the Time of Cholera.",
            "A valiant attempt to turn a complex novel into a compelling movie is hamstrung by a conventional literary sensibility, an uneven tone and, crucially, a failure to establish a moving, meaningful connection between its two major players.",
            "It's all yodeling Shakira ballads and emotional shots of the would-be lovers staring at each other until their cheeks pale from exhaustion",
            "Sometimes you're watching a bad movie, and you're like, 'Well, I'm still entertained,' so I'm recommending it on that sort of level.",
            "Mike Newell's handsome adaptation of Gabriel Garcia Marquez' novel looks lovely, but feels lifeless; the chemistry between the main characters just isn't there.",
            "The story is vibrantly painted with wit and vivacity - even if it doesn't tread new ground.",
            "Succeeds in its essence. [Full review in Spanish]",
            " Dull to the point of tedium, overlong and longwinded.",

            "You won't even be able to enjoy it for its set decoration, so numerous and egregious are the movie's miscalculations.",
            "Film in the Time of Oprah is more like it.",
            "One can recognize the elements that made the book such a beloved work--and see how these elements are so completely botched in screen translation.",
            "A hodge-podge of histrionic, ridiculous scenes cobbled together with no build up.",
            "No, Love in the Time of Cholera is not the masterpiece that its source material is, but by choosing not to top the original it still ends up mostly succeeding as a film.",
            "Unlike the unfilmable novel, Newell's discordant picture exhibits the worst symptoms of fever itself: unpleasant to endure and then quickly forgotten.",
            "A saga about love in the most romantic of senses, Mike Nicholls' adaptation of Gabriel Garcia Marquez' acclaimed novel is one man's ode to that ethereal emotion that is an end in itself.",
            "Never read Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and still waiting for a sequel to The Notebook? There's something here for you.",
            "... Newell and Harwood completely missed the mark with this one, turning a complex love story into a superficial period film with no heart or heat.",
            "Listless, poorly scripted, badly acted and displaying an unforgivable misinterpretation of its source material, Cholera is easily one of the worst adaptations of a great book ever mounted.",

            "Condescending liberal dreck like In the Valley of Elah is just as awful as a thousand Fox-News commentators",
            "In the Valley of Elah is a powerful, emotional indictment of what contemporary war can do to young men. It is a potent moral tale. This is not your father's war.",

            "Regardless of which side of the political fence one sits on, 'In the Valley of Elah''s power can't be denied and the strong acting must be appreciated.",
            "It's a quality film, but all the truly emotional moments come from watching and listening to the soldiers, which doesn't really happen until the very end.",
            "It is extraordinary that a film this muted could resonate with a message this strong.",

            "Happily, the leads carry the day: James Marsden as a prince of grinning vanity, Susan Sarandon as the wicked stepmother, and, above all, Amy Adams, who, in the role of a would-be princess, finds true momentum, not just sappiness, in the farce of innocence.",
            "Though the film is full of allusions to the Disney canon, they are generally unobtrusive echoes rather than eager satires. This is a children's movie at which adults are also welcome, not a cartoon for grownups.",

            "Enchanted says it all.",

            "Director Kevin Lima's new film Enchanted is seemingly made for all the women who grew up on fairytale endings. But growing up is perhaps the wrong word to use. Permanently infantilized might be a better term.",
            "In the hands of Adams, the evolution elicits as much sympathy as it does laughter, largely because she grounds every pivotal moment in wide-eyed kindness and generosity, pushing us to care about her fate.",
            "After about half-an-hour the comic steam is dispersed by whimsy, though Timothy Spall is pretty funny as the Evil Stepmother's varlet valet.",
            "This delightfully funny and smart family film certainly lives up to its title. ",
            "By the time you are reading this, the ads will already be proclaiming that Enchanted is \"enchanting,\" and for once they'll be spot on.",
            "The result is a fresh, feel-good crowd-pleaser that pokes affectionate fun at fairytale conventions while remaining true to their spirit.",
            "It's so sugary that the adults in the audience should beware of the dangers of Type 2 Diabetes, though overall this is a great film to take the kids to during the school holidays.",
            "Narrated by Julie Andrews with Marsden gleefully camping it up and Adams the personification of winning charm, only a Scrooge would deny the film possesses oodles of fun and wit. It's just not as enchanting as it deserves to be.",
            "Sometimes the big studios get it right. Enchanted is a high-concept fish-out-of-water tale that works on so many levels it's dizzying. Plus, it features a breakout performance by the luminous Amy Adams.",
            "Enchanted is as conventional as the films it tries to satirize.",
            "Amy Adams is a star in the making.",
            "There's no big shocker ending in Enchanted, and it follows a pretty typical formula, but what makes it a winner is its ability to make you smile anyway. Be forewarned, you might even get a cheek ache.",
            "Enchanted is a sweet romantic fable, with some loveable performances and some genuine good humour.",
            "Warm, funny and delightfully nostalgic, this is a must-watch this Christmas for the whole family."

            "Cheadle's finest hour and proof that Sandler can act. Funny, sad and flawed - like its characters.",

            "Mira Nair turns Jhumpa Lahiri's gentle, evocative novel The Namesake, into a gentle, evocative film.",
            "There are bound to be quibbles about whether they get their Bengali right or whether Nair captures the culture and ethos. But it still can't take much away from this humane, warm and elegantly crafted film.",
            "The Namesake captures the interior struggle between centuries of history and the appeal of living only in the now, and it's grippingly beautiful and overwhelmingly moving.",
            "What holds it together are the subtle loving performances by Tabu and Khan, both Bollywoood stars. They never overplay, never spell out what can be said in a glance or a shrug, communicate great passion very quietly.",
            "It is a saga told in small pieces, a patchwork of short scenes that tumble after each other almost apologetically, as if they would love to linger a little longer, but there is too much to tell and only so much time in which to do it.",
            "This poignant tale resonates wherever you are placed in the world.",
            "One of those films that easily wins your respect, but struggles to hold your attention. ",
            "[Nair's] film covers so much ground that it's hard to sustain emotional investment in its characters.",
            "The Namesake is an unhurried, insightful and deeply moving generational drama that cannot be recommended highly enough.",
            "Since Nair made such a stir with her fresh approach to William Thackeray's Vanity Fair, the fact that she simply translated The Namesake from page to screen proves to be a bit of a letdown.",
            "Sprawling, uneven, heartfelt",
            "Buoyed by terrific performances from Irrfan Kahn and the tremendous Tabu, the film is a bit homogenized but does a good job of exploring the dynamics of blending foreign cultures with American ways of life.",
            "lacks focus and never quite finds its footing",
            "This movie is not bad, I just couldn't connect with it. The Namesake is poignant (I cried once) and spans many years with grace and great acting, but it may be beyond my ken to truly appreciate as it deserves.",
            "Mira Nair's film is called The Namesake which immediately focuses our attention toward the value of names and naming (and that theme is explored occasionally within the film), but to slip even further down the rabbit hole, the more intriguing area of disc",
            "Kal Penn, who got kooky for 'Harold and Kumer Go To White Castle,' shows his impressive serious side here as Gogol Ganguli, a guy who suspects that his given name may be a fatal turnoff with females.",
            "A magnificent meditation on what it might mean for many immigrants to be American in the 21st Century.",
            "A fascinating and gripping drama on the search for identity...",
            "The all too familiar tale of the upwardly mobile immigrants conflicted between tradition and modernity is played out for all it is worth.",
            "Fabulous immigrant-family saga to see with teens.",
            "This is a film made with obvious care and affection, both for the specifics of the story and the broader society it depicts."

            "It's a very odd film that can discuss heart-blackening guilt, loveless marriage, pain and regret only to taper off into a dry-eyed ending.",
            "Given its stellar cast -- including Vanessa Redgrave, Meryl Streep and Glenn Close -- and source material, it's hard not to think it should be better.",
            "Antiseptic bourgeois swank",
            "What's the difference between slasher films and chick flicks? In slasher films they suffer less, and they die quicker. Evening, bless its banal heart, is a chick flick in all its fatuous glory.",
            "Frankly I could watch Danes, Collette, Streep, Close, Richardson, etc., as they go food shopping, which just goes to show what a bunch of great actors can do for a fairly conventional tear-jerker.",
            "Strong cast is best part of tragic romantic drama.",
            "An old lady takes a long time to die in this po-faced literary effort as a bed-ridden Redgrave looks back to the golden summer when her young self (Danes) found love.",
            "Evening is a film about regrets that doesn't say an awful lot, but somehow holds your attention with the scenes between Redgrave and Streep sure to bring a tear to your eye - or at least your mum's.",
            "Dull. It's hard to engage with the characters, the themes are underdeveloped and the tone is flat as the waters lapping the Wittenborn beach.",
            "Adapting from Susan Minot's bestseller, Hungarian director Lajos Koltai's (Fateless) pulls together a formidable cast - Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, Toni Collette - but then leaves them to wade through a sickly stew.",
            "The film disintegrates into an indulgent succession of intense, fawning exchanges that overwhelm Minot's thin and monotonous tale.",
            "Recycling ideas and characters from 250 years of romantic literature without adding any new ones of its own, Evening is like dining with Jane Austen and Barbara Cartland and not being allowed to get down from the table.",
            "This multi-generational chick flick may be blessed with a stellar cast but unfortunately errs on the pretentious side.",
            "Emotionally unengaging, overlong and frequently dull drama, despite the best efforts of its talented cast.",
            "An astounding cast and high production values make this film worth seeing, even as turns into a girly melodrama.",
            "The film is a fine example of what works within the pages of a book doesn't necessarily work onscreen, particularly when the book in question is as dense as Minot's, and apparently as fragile."

            "Knowing how this harrowing story played out in real life doesn't diminish its power in the slightest.",
            "Although it is impossible to erase the spectre of Brangelina from your mind altogether while watching Jolie inhabit the role of Mariane Pearl, you can manage it for surprisingly long stretches at a time.",
            "Jolie, dominating nearly every scene, is rather remarkable in this star vehicle, effectively conveying a convincing combination of unwavering dedication and the dire desperation of a woman who insists on remaining at the center of the search for her man.",
            "Aside from casting Jolie, the bravest decision was to shoot largely in Karachi. The risk pays dividends with highly evocative location work that allows you almost to the smell that crowded city and feel the chaos.",

            "No preaching and no proselytizing. Just a horrible happening in a continually complicated world.",

            "Torpid, faux-inspirational",
            "The film would be nothing without Angelina Jolie's brave, powerful performance.",
            "It is to director Michael Winterbottom's (24 Hour Party People, Welcome to Sarajevo) credit that he can achieve such a powerful film without bludgeoning his audience with the images of the unspeakable violence that were inherent in Pearl's last days.",
            "Angelina Jolie continues to prove her acting is worth more discussion than her personal life. It's not always fun to watch, but it's an important piece of work.",
            "British director Michael Winterbottom's film is as close to naturalism as one can get.",
            "When Mariane finds out about Daniel's death, she lets out a guttural scream; one that rivals Sean Penn's outburst in Mystic River in raw emotional defeat.",
            "... A Mighty Heart fails to do the story justice or to flesh out the heroic people involved.",
            "Absorbingly touching and terrifying, A Mighty Heart is an intimate film but has the gutsy and reflective ingredients of sorrow, introspection and outrage.",
            "Powerful docudrama is best for mature viewers.",
            "A docudrama that is focused on Daniel Pearl's wife. While interesting in its own way, it does not begin to reflect on who Daniel Pearl really was or why he died.",
            "If A Mighty Heart was either a flat-out documentary or larger-scale movie version of the same story, it would be a lot more intriguing. But then again, neither of those would be a proper Angelina Jolie Oscar vehicle.",
            "We know how it will end, and that is what makes the suspense Winterbottom creates such an impressive feat.",
            "A Mighty Heart is a powerful film on all accounts, something that brings a human face to such a collective time of confusion."

            "Rock's version is funnier, blacker, hipper, and sexier, but Rohmer's shows a little more skin.",
            "Viagra jokes, I-have-a-headache rebuffs, a sequence devoted to the humiliation of buying condoms at a pharmacy...c'mon, Chris, you can do better than that.",
            "I Think I Love My Wife is first and foremost a sex comedy. But Rock is sharp enough to set it in a world where people of all races share the same dreams and desires -- if not the same real estate.",
            "Very little that's clever, romantic or witty in this formulaic romp.",
            "A laugh-less comedy, an unmoving drama, and a ragtag assemblage of feeble characters spouting pathetic dialogue.",
            "Rock tries to add some humorous moments, but most come off as either crass and crude or just plain weird.",
            "Just imagine how much more authentic, topical and engaging this would be if Rock made this film in 2015 instead of eight years earlier.",
            "Pootie Tang was spikier and funnier",

            "Neither stylistically innovative nor particularly entertaining.",
            "some witty social observations, but there are also some slapstick scenes that feel as if they were taken from a completely different movie.",

            "After four magical cinematic chapters of Harry Potter, the franchise finally hits a bump in the road with Order of the Phoenix, which is full of plot detail and short of all the magic and charm that made this such a successful series.",
            "Good, but not quite great, Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix does not wear out its welcome, keeps the franchise intact, entertains and enthralls, and leaves us looking toward the future and the ultimate battle between Harry and Voldemort.",

            "The enjoyable moments nearly all occur when Potter newcomer Imelda Staunton, playing the latest 'Defence Against the Dark Arts' is on-screen. Alas, Yates' obsession with exposition over action is this dreary, utilitarian film's real undoing. ",
            "Traditional drama is usually a three-act deal: set-up, conflict, resolution. But this is the three-act deal every two minutes. Danger, baddie, magic. Danger, baddie, magic. Danger, baddie, magic. It's as tired as it is tiresome.",
            "It feels like the slowest of Harry Potter movies...a great character dies, but he wasn't really utilized well, so you don't feel what you should...Order and the Phoenix is enjoyable and has its place, but it's my least favorite.",
            "Author J.K. Rowling clearly knew a totalitarian regime when she saw one, and never hesitated to call out the toadies and enablers along with her big baddie.",
            "This film does so many things right, it's hard to say what to single out for praise.",
            "The older these kids get, the darker and more engrossing the Harry Potter movies become.",
            "It's clear that Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix has left the dewy-eyed awe of childhood magic and entered the brooding angst of adolescent powerlessness.",

            "There's no doubt that Rush Hour 3 is anything but a mess. And yet there were moments when I found myself laughing giddily at the inanity of it all, and other moments when the picture was so beautiful to look at that I almost forgot its faults.",
            "The final, and anti-climactic, 'threequel' of the summer has nothing new to say. A staleness pervades the film, despite all efforts to inject freshness and excitement into a tired story.",

            "No matter how fast Chris Tucker shoots his mouth or Jackie Chan flashes his fists, they can't recapture the charm of the original Rush Hour in this third installment.",
            "The film is formulaic and the plot is barely connected together. But it moves along quickly and there's the occasional smile.",

            "We should be routing for Farmer and delighted that his dreams are finally becoming a reality, but, instead, the implausibility of the whole thing, the sheer Disneyification of its premise, the Capra-corn nature of its \"follow your dreams and never, ever q",

            "While it is far too long, especially in the home stretch, The Astronaut Farmer is a heartwarming and fun story about the tenacity it takes to see a dream through.",

            "It's just a shame the script doesn't push the humour further; brief, amusing put-downs aren't quite enough to make this a bonafide comedy. But if you're looking for a well-performed drama about dementia, you've got it.",

            "Even if there aren't many other reasons to give this contrived and too often silly film a chance, Faithfull makes a captivating leading lady.",

            "The camera is discrete, the characters humane and the mood introspective in director Sam Garbarski's character study of a lonely woman who finds dignity where others might see only degradation.",

            "For people who take their movies seriously, a quick course in Romanian might now be necessary -- and so is a trip to the theater to see 4 Months.",
            "This is an unsettling film, brilliantly acted all around, most especially by Vasiliu and Marinca."

            "Away From Her is a phantom of a movie whose beautiful flakes fall into the deep crevices of memory long after the seasons change.",
            "Beautifully written, from an Alice Munro short story, this movie directed by an actress rarely missteps, even when it bravely includes the dark humor inherent in this situation.",
            "Superb, from its subtle atmospheres to its fine performances. Julie Christie is exquisite as ever purveying the spirit of a woman whose radiance remains even as it dims like the glow of sunset on a snowbound lake.",
            "Away From Her got to me in a way no other movie has this year, eliciting copious tears.",
            "As this intimate, beautifully observed film unfolds, you realize that the story's themes are relevant no matter what age you happen to be.",
            "Polley's direction is simple, yet assured, with a vision that allows the actors to shine. The cast is more than up to the task.",
            "Polley displays a keen understanding of the sense of confusion and loss that goes along with Alzheimer's, and she handles it well, guiding the film with a warmth, humor, and heart.",
            "That the film does justice to the original short story is saying something.",
            "No one dreams of the twilight transpiring in \"Away From Her,\" but, in its words, it's not bad luck. It's just life. You can't beat life. A tenderly told tragedy about Alzheimer's Disease's erosive effects, Sarah Polley's film avoids movie-of-the-week sap.",
            "Too content with its own \"maturity\" and \"restraint,\" yet it invaluably offers Christie for audiences in delicate contemplation, and chaste consummation",
            "Christie is brilliant as steely but brittle Fiona, a woman who knows her mind completely and yet, in the end, cannot hang on to it, while Pinsent eloquently portrays the gradual ebbing away of a partnership, as delicate and unstoppable as snow-melt.",
            "Una bella historia de amor a merced de una enfermedad, filmada con delicadeza por Sarah Polley y sensiblemente interpretada por Julie Christie, Gordon Pinsent y Olympia Dukakis.",
            "A beautifully acted, poignant film about a man who slowly loses his wife to Alzheimer's.",
            "A complex series of relationships revolve around a nursing home romance.",
            "Julie Christie as an Alzheimer's afflicted wife achieves the perfect psychological mixture of despair, mystery, rebellion against the unappreciated devotion that has been her lot in married life, and an ultimate odd but eloquent personal liberation.",
            "Hallmark card presentation of the onset of Alzheimer's. Totally sincere and totally unrealistic.",
            "Christie (with whom Polley acted in Hal Hartley's No Such Thing) is still a radiant presence at 66 and she rivets us to the screen.",
            "Of the four brilliant performances that sustain it, the standout is by Julie Christie, ravishing at 66, who communicates as much with utter stillness as in her beautifully articulated lines."

            "Chabrol may be one of the great survivors of the New Wave, but this is an old man's film.",
            "The film's surface realism won't fool anyone: it's clear that The Girl Cut in Two is a fable, a dark modern-day fairy tale about innocence and corruption, power and illusion.",
            "Leave it to master Claude Chabrol, though, to make a film about the varieties of corruption and depravity without so much as a glimpse of nudity.",
            "A few flashes of insight or giddy humour, conveyed via portentous close-ups or fast cutting, remind us of Chabrol's directorial power; but he seems rather too casual behind the camera lately.",

            "Another patented Chabrol commentary, not a morality play but something far more worldly and difficult to ignore.",
            "Chabrol's astute dissection of sex, class and show business. Bravo, Claude, a rare man in profound touch with the darker impulses of his species.",
            "It's not fresh material, but in the hands of a master like Chabrol it appears like a fresh breeze.",
            "Talk is everything, with action hinted at the edges, as Chabrol's camera sidles off to look at a casually thrown book, or skates away from anything salacious.",
            "This description may make this movie sound much more interesting than it is.",
            "The relationships are never completely convincing and there are too many unresolved questions to create an entirely satisfying tale.",

            "Most people won't care enough about these people or believe in their relationships to sit out all 115 minutes of this icily mannered film that continually hints at darker, more subversive themes of sado-masochism than it dares to explore.",
            "Heavy-handed French drama is a clumsy affair.",
            "By the time the story springs to life and becomes the thriller, of sorts, that it seems set up to be, we have had to sit through 90-odd minutes of turgid melodrama.",
            "One keeps hoping that some of that sinister Chabrolian wit will enliven the film's smooth surface, but alas, it never does."

            "In the past, poker-playing in the movies was likely to be something exciting but dangerous, not something to be dwelt on technically, and analogous to other criminal and self-destructive activities in the storyline.",

            "It's a shame that Barrymore's scenes are such a washout because the rest of the film is perfectly fine.",

            "You wouldn't think a film about a group of British skinheads during the early 1980s could be a sweet, nostalgic coming-of-age period piece, but that's the surprise of the authentic, fresh and utterly relevant This Is England.",
            "Its tough but moving neo-realist approach make it one of the better British films of recent times.",
            "It may be the best work to date from the talented 34-year-old writer-director of Twenty Four Seven (1997).",
            "A drama that's so potent and persuasive yet also natural and intimate that it almost has the heft of a documentary.",
            "A movie about the allure of groupthink and how the warm comfort of being surrounded by peers wilts all sense of balance.",

            "It is the war within him--and by extension, within the minds of many embittered, working class young men left behind in Thatcher's England--that Meadows's film most strikingly portrays.",
            "Steeped in the raw mix of ska and punk sound as expression of the youth alienation and misguided rage of those tumultuous times, an alarming voice of the surging army of jobless youth back then dubbed 'no hopers.'",
            "Stephen Graham delivers a bravura performance as the brooding, mesmerizing Combo, clearly channeling Russell Crowe in Romper Stomper.",
            "Riveting.",
            "Meadows obviously knows the working class neighborhoods that he depicts. There's a grit and honesty to his film as he chronicles the mundane details of these kids' lives.",
            "An intelligent, spare, mean-streets sort of story, This Is England features superb performances...",
            "This Is England grabs you by the scruff of the neck and yanks you into the Thatcher 1980s with brute force.",
            "A post-punk gem of a drama that seems bent on being both funny and deadly serious.",
            "This is not the England that makes you want to hop on over for a visit, but the movie is worthy of a quick look.",
            "[Meadows] captures the palpable anger of impoverished youth, without money or jobs or hope, seeking to blame somebody else for their troubles.",
            "[Shane] Meadows' fictionalized version of these events is at least as vivid -- and at times as hard to watch -- as some of Ken Loach's more stark dramas."

            "Sam Riley is fascinating as Curtis, a hypersensitive young man hobbled by his incurable disease, and Samantha Morton is poignant as his put-upon wife.",
            "The film nails both the malaise and creative vigor of Curtis' short, bruised and chillingly relatable life.",
            "Sam Riley, a newcomer to the big screen who portrays Curtis with eerie accuracy, has the stringy, underfed looks of a schoolboy in the midst of a sudden growth spurt.",
            "Riley should have been nominated for an Oscar; his work here is on par with that year's er, Daniel Day Lewis...",
            "On a certain level, Corbijn's approach to filmmaking reminds me of Gus Van Sant's loose take on Kurt Cobain.",
            "This film owes its power to a refusal to overplay its die-young, stay-pretty ending, and a scary good turn by Sam Reilly, channeling Ian Curtis.",
            "Sam Riley is a revelation in the lead role in what is one of the outstanding British films of the year.",
            "The film overcomes the central miscasting of Samantha Morton. ",
            "The way Ian Curtis blocked his onstage movement mirrored isolationism in his home life. He clasped the microphone stand like a drowning man would a life preserver, but he couldn't stay afloat in dreary waters of his own creation. A seamless rock biopic.",
            "Film %u0107e stoga biti shvatljiv samo onim gledateljima koji detalje povijesti \"Joy Divisiona\" i Curtisovog %u017Eivota imaju u malom prstu, a to su, dakako, najokorjeliji fanovi.",
            "Control never gets any closer to the mystery than when the music plays. Too bad it cuts the songs short, returning to the banalities they were meant to shatter.",
            "Control does justice to Curtis' legacy but fails to make any further grasps for significance.",

            "Positioning art as a necessary surrender to a creative force which removes the self dangerously from existence and society, Control intimately connects in tragic yet euphoric ways to the mixed blessing of the radically unleashed musical imagination.",

            "The film, however, beginning with a flashback to 1963, is a soft-pedalled account of Lavoe's rise to fame and his drug-related downfall that has more in common with the biopic parody Walk Hard than anything as muddy as real life.",

            "An effective, unassuming and old-fashioned action adventure which is - perhaps a little faute de mieux - probably the best film of the week.",

            "A quirky first half of torture, starvation and, um, stinky farts gives way to crazed jungle fever as Dengler leads a great escape into the heart of darkness.",
            "Herzog tells the story with a minimum of directorial flourish, relying instead on Bale's extraordinary ability to remain concentrated.",
            "Somehow his story, reenacted in the feature film, fails to catch fire in the way it does in the documentary. It looks oddly conventional, even flat.",
            "While Zahn and Davies offer amazing performances, Bale's starring turn often falls flat. Herzog doesn't give him much to work with: The writer-director is reluctant to allow his hero any flaws, even fear and despair, on his harrowing journey.",
            "Unlike a traditional Hollywood movie, Rescue Dawn follows the pacing and irony of real life. It is far from predictable and far from formulaic.",
            "The jungle has been very good to Werner Herzog.",
            "Werner Herzog isn't interested in patriotism as product placement, like other directors might be. Though uncommonly somber, \"Dawn\" is still an engrossing prison-break film. It's not \"The Great Escape.\" It's \"The Sheer, Dumb Luck Escape.\"",
            "Dumps traditional war movie bravado in favor of a subtler touch, and softens the blow of an unspeakable ordeal by shooting it amidst a series of jarringly beautiful and poetic canvases.",
            "Bale's lack of ambiguity points to the biggest limitation of a film that makes the grade as an adventure yarn by ignoring the most disturbing implications of its story.",
            "Not the typical Chuck Norris movie, but just as rancid in its own \"edgy\" pretentious manner.",
            "Rescue Dawn wouldn't be half the film it is if it were not for the stellar performances by Bale and Zahn.",
            "At first glance, \"Rescue Dawn\" might seem like Herzog gone Hollywood, but it's still very much the man's work. Herzog has his cake and eats it too.",
            "Complex and multi-faceted, Herzog has made a film with the skin of an action movie and the heart of a rhythmic, reflective poem",
            "The most un-Herzog-like Werner Herzog film you're likely to see, this based-on-fact Vietnam War drama is very classy if rather standard stuff. But it is considerably enlivened by the always engaging presence of Christian Bale.",
            "Emocionante como aventura e como exemplo da for\u00e7a do esp\u00edrito humano, comprova o talento inquestion\u00e1vel de Herzog, um dos diretores contempor\u00e2neos mais importantes e surpreendentes.",
            "The only problem with director Werner Herzog's well-paced film is that it seems to have little point beyond admiring Dengler's tenacity.",
            "While you have to admire Bale's dedication - he looks like a human skeleton - the film slows to a crawl in the middle as Dengler attempts to survive life in prison. Proceedings may pick up in the last half hour, but getting there proves to be an endurance"

            "Pride is a fairly predictable entry in the highly predictable inspirational sports drama genre. But the movie is saved by the earnest, believable performance of Terrence Howard and by Bernie Mac in a more serious role than usual.",
            "It really has nothing to be proud of but a central performance much better than the movie itself deserves. It's time for Terrence Howard to appear in a movie that rises to his level.",
            "Terrence Howard's unforced charisma did a lot for Crash and Hustle & Flow, and he's the chief reason Pride is worth catching.",
            "Working closely with the real Jim Ellis, Terrence Howard's portrayal is moving and accurate.",
            "Howard seems to pride himself on portraying characters with both a deep sense of flawed humanity and a redemptive quality.",

            "Maybe because it focused on swimming, and didn't really capture the drama of the sport, it came off like a TV movie. It even borrowed from Dead Poets Society with an 'Oh Captain, My Captain' moment.",
            "Feel-good swimming flick takes on racism.",
            "Howard anchors the film with a charismatic turn. He doesn't turn Ellis into a plaster saint but portrays a complex and complicated man.",
            "A movie that deserves to succeed, but falls just short because it shows us much more than it teaches us.",
            "...undone by its reliance on exceedingly conventional elements.",
            "Despite its shortcomings, Pride proves to be an effective feel-good sports drama.",
            "Directed by Zimbabwean-born Sunu Gonera, who seems fascinated with 1970s American 'ghetto' atmosphere; he overdoses viewers on afros, hoop earrings and graffiti, which at least keeps the movie watchable.",
            "Bodies are framed and lit to be seen. In a movie where characters appear in dimly lit interiors or near light-reflecting chlorine-blue pools, this is no small thing.",
            "While Terrence Howard is subdued in the role of Coach Ellis throughout much of the film, Bernie Mac provides a much needed lift especially early on.",
            "This is an inspirational movie that really touches the heart.",
            "Pride's story was etched in stone ages ago by mysterious movie powers beyond our understanding, and all the Staples Singers' songs in the world won't keep it from its appointed rounds.",
            "By painting in such broad strokes and playing up race-baiting that Ellis says he didn't experience, are they not couching the movie as somehow uniquely \"black\"?",
            "I have seen Pride now too many times without actually seeing it."

            "What every single person in this film does is treat the other adults as adults. Seeing it done so consistently emphasizes how rare it is to see this not only on screen, but also in real life.",
            "The landscape with Mont Sainte-Victoire regularly in view is seductively beautiful.",
            "A warm-hearted tribute to a disappearing way of life, the unhurried Grocer's Son is a well acted film where the journey is more important than the final destination.",
            "Writer/director Eric Guirado lets events unfold at their own relaxed pace, and has a feel for simmering family resentments, while the wonderful Clotilde Hesme is effortlessly charming in the role of the free-spirited best friend.",
            "A little predictable in places, but explores family relationships with pathos and perception.",
            "Unfolding amid the dappled sunshine and dusty roads of Provence, this is a film that lifts your spirits.",
            "Emotionally engaging, impressively directed and superbly written French drama with strong performances from Nicolas Cazale and Clotilde Hesme.",
            "How could a French audience not enjoy such a nostalgic look at a simpler and bucolic way of life?",
            "Beautiful Provence, and its charming traditionalists, colorfully work their summer magic on a hunky wayward son with terrific appeal to ferment a sparkling romance.",
            "It's not a great movie, but it is a beguiling one: a Gallic version of American films such as Doc Hollywood or Cars, in which a city-dweller opens up to life when he succumbs to the languid pace and the intense one-on-one relationships of the country.",
            "It's sublime work, the whole picture having a firmly enthralling lived-in consistency that's cant help but feel utterly genuine.",
            "Anyone who takes a chance on this unpromising import will be richly rewarded.",
            "For all of its sleepy charms and pretty shots of the countryside, the film doesn't serve up a lot of fresh insights, unless you count finding out what senior citizens buy from grocery vans in these little hamlets.",
            "If more Americans were OK with subtitles, The Grocer's Son would be the perfect Sunday-night TV movie.",
            "Eric Guirado's lovely French drama The Grocer's Son is about that moment in a young person's life when he realizes that he is, despite all efforts to the contrary, a grown-up."

            "Bright, campy and wonderfully light, Hairspray reminds us that fun comes in all shapes and sizes. It's also one of the few 'event' movies this summer that doesn't outstay its welcome. That's worth singing about, no matter what your name is.",
            "Waters cultists have ample reason to be wary, but the film retains a surprisingly subversive edge that undercuts its blinding surface gloss.",
            "It's amiable, it's bouncy, it's got a sweet unknown in the lead flanked by a cast of bankable stars and, providing as it does an amiable and bouncy and sweet escape from a summer's worth of clunky blockbusters.",
            "Hairspray is an infectious aerosol comedy with nearly every hair in place.",
            "Marc Shaiman and Chris Wittman's score sparkles and the film's production design and appearance remain faithful to Waters' vision of 1960's Baltimore. ",
            "The latest version is just as good, if not better, with an infectious soundtrack and an all-star cast that precisely hits every note. This is easily the most entertaining major studio release of 2007.",
            "Nikki Blonsky is a complete delight.",
            "The songs by composer Marc Shaiman and lyricist Scott Whitman are big, bold and deliriously infectious, the kind of music that leaves you wanting to stand up and shout, or at least get up and dance.",
            "This film leaps at you with such joy and vigour and generosity you cannot reject it.",
            "If any movie musical could threaten the standing of retro favourite Grease, it's this one.",
            "Director-choreographer Adam Shankman has come up with one of the purest entertainments of the summer.",
            "It pays respect to the original while also carving its own image as a truly good musical.",
            "Much as Hairspray serves as a showcase for the effervescent charms of newcomer Blonsky, its greatest trick is to revitalise the careers of a few old Hollywood faithfuls.",
            "In alchemy the transmuting of materials between forms distills them to their purest elements. In film, the opposite is true. The more iterations, the more muddled things get. Hairspray is good at what it does but not everything it does is good.",
            "The script is full of anachronisms, but Hairspray's sense of history delivers a needed spritz in the face.",
            "Much of the fun comes from director-choreographer Adam Shankman's happy acceptance of musical staples",
            "Shankman's crassly theatrical attenuation of Hairspray only draws gay culture away from a moment of American history with which it ought to have a great deal in common",

            "Hairspray is an energetic romp, but as a social statement -- which it pretends to be -- it's cartoonish. And as a playful look back at a time and place, it's simplistic shtik. It's a mountain of whipped cream, with an occasional chocolate sprinkle.",
            "I will confess that Travolta totally turned me around. A mountain of a woman in his female fat suit, he commits 150% to the role.",

            "Whether you like the film probably depends on whether you can treat it all as seriously as Pinter and Branagh. If you can't, this short, brackish piece will not work at all, even if you don't regard it as a piece of piss.",

            "Despite Branagh's every attempt to capitalise on the intimacy of the cinematic medium with (intrusive) close-ups, the direction is heavy handed; the result being a dramatic, but emotionally cold experience",

            "In its wrenching shift from farce to tragedy, and its evocation of the bridge offered by friendship, Talk to Me tells it, and keeps on tellin' it, much as 'Petey' Greene would have.",
            "It's a visually and aurally riveting trip to an important time from a perspective few here will know, about a person worth meeting.",
            "A stronger screenplay and more sensitive direction would have made this movie into something far more genuinely uplifting than it is.",
            "The movie is decent enough, but contains Greene's story in a sentimentalised career arc.",
            "A traditionally handsome biopic bursting with 1960s period detail and firecracker performances, Talk To Me tackles one of the most volatile periods in American history, but tragically finds nothing interesting to say about it.",
            "A proposal full of self-confidence and expressive force. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Though funny in places, the film lacks any decent secondary characters... but it's easy to see why Lemmons would decide to keep the camera as much as possible on the two excellent central performances.",
            "Cheadle's skillful performance makes Petey a flawed hero worth rooting for, even when his actions offend. Ejiofor also impresses with his subtle turn as the conflicted, success-hungry Dewey. In addition, the film boasts an excellent sound track.",
            "Kasi Lemmons' radio drama of flamboyance, fury and finesse cranks the funk on a sister station to \"Talk Radio\" and \"Good Morning Vietnam,\" powered by two performances of impeccable clarity and cut from Don Cheadle and Chiwetel Ejiofor.",
            "Although the director succumbs to the genre\u00e2(TM)s temptation to wrap up a messy life with a neat, platitudinous resolution, she lets her cast give Greene and his era its due.",
            "Talk to Me is an incisive portrait of a provocative figure. It comes very close to caricature, but remains human and lively.",
            "Just as she did in Hustle and Flow, Taraji P. Henson steals many a scene and is wonderful as Greene's flamboyant girlfriend.",
            "Don Cheadle and Chiwetel Ejiofor make a terrific duo, first as enemies, then as colleagues and finally as partners %u2013 until the partnership self destructs.",
            "Largely thanks to Cheadle and Ejiofor in the main roles, it settles into a persuasive rhythm and airs some of the big questions about black struggle against oppression without resorting to glib, feel-good answers.",
            "Even Martin Sheen is keepin' it real.",
            "A good movie about a powerful friendship, and it brings a bygone era back to life.",
            "Hysterically potent, thought-provoking and deliciously nostalgic. Overall, the proposed chatter is warranted in the movingly impish Talk to Me.",
            "Ejiofor and Cheadle are a force to be reckoned with...",
            "This straightforward schematic biopic never talks to me.",
            "This biopic of Greene, a DJ most Brits will not know, has a limited appeal.",
            "Poignant and often very funny, Cheadle deserves a clutch of prizes come awards season.",
            "If the picture doesn't ultimately live up to the raw vitality of Cheadle's performance, it remains an uplifting snapshot that broadcasts its message with zero distortion. Tune in and you won't be turned off."

            "In a film where dialogue comes at a premium, Van Sant allows his camera to do the talking, and when it rests too long on one subject, the commentary feels like overstatement. Elsewhere, 'Paranoid Park' is eloquent in its terseness."

            "Ends up more like a middling after-school special than an insightful look at family dynamics.",
            "[Actress Schroeder] gives Gracie a credibly rugged edge, building her into a mini-tower of blond ambition and almost rescuing the role from clich\u00e9. Almost, but not quite, not when burdened with a script so proudly rooted in uplift's trite traditions.",
            "It's a nice film and the Shue family, honestly, they should be proud of what they've done.",
            "Gracie is a gentle, easygoing picture -- it's not exactly dramatically gripping, but somehow, its spirit carries it through.",
            "There are some powerful moments (such as Elisabeth Shue, as Gracie's mother, giving a touching, unexpected speech about how she doesn't share her family's competitive spirit), and by its end Gracie earns its cheers.",
            "The reason these formulaic films work is they give sports fans what we want: a hard-working underdog we can root for and a sense that the sports we love have some deeper meaning.",
            "Gritty girl soccer drama with a powerful message.",
            "When you wake up after napping through this earnest timewaster, you'll feel relieved, but you won't know why. Here's a clue: Gracie can't bend it.",
            "A gutsy performance by Carly Schroeder is the high point of this likeable story about a girl with a dream",
            "In addition to Carly Schroeder's performance, the highlights are its honesty, willingness to show real family struggles, and the gradual way Gracie achieves success.",
            "A wholesome female empowerment adventure, and one very likely to resonate with youngsters of both sexes in the pre-teen crowd.",

            "Lindsay suggests -- during the inevitable mother-daughter heart-to-heart -- that Gracie persist despite the many odds because Lindsay did not.",
            "Despite flaws, though, this stirring independent production is remarkable for its honest portrayal of a family grappling with grief and a female taking the penalty kick to score points for gender equity.",
            "Ultimately, \"Gracie\" scores as a feminist inspirational sports film.",
            "This labor of love from the Shue siblings is a better than average sports movie. More than that, it's about a family pulling together to help one member achieve her dream.",
            "Making the team and playing in the big game grab the headlines, but the repaired relationship at the heart of Gracie shows that there are bigger prizes than kicking a ball around a field.",

            "As long as Brick Lane remains focused on Nazneen, it succeeds admirably.",
            "... an intriguing and visually interesting film that in aggregate never escapes the genre ghetto. It is another immigration song, a glancing curiosity that never really penetrates our preconceived romantic illusions."

            "The film lags badly in the middle; the flashbacks to Ben's childhood aren't especially interesting and the lengthy soccer sequence is sheer dead weight.",

            "[Cassavetes] treats cliches as fodder for comedy and nuances as the mainstays of a deeper, more beguiling sexual humor. What's engaging about this movie is that all the conventional trysts become low-key nightmare farce.",
            "Her Nora is a complicated mess you can't help but fall in love with even as she manages to tear herself apart, and watching Posey slowly bring this frazzled female to love's doorstep is absolutely joyous.",
            "Parker Posey is one of those rare performers who can elevate a mediocre film into a good one and a good one into a great one simply by the sheer force of her personality."

            "Faintly egotistical biologist-turned-filmmaker Rob Stewart spent four years making this investigative doc and the result, despite his tendency towards over-earnest, stoner-esque commentary, is enlightening, shocking and more than a little worrying.",
            "Sharkwater delivers an important message, and its underwater photography is breathtaking. But Stewart lessens the impact by focusing much too much on himself. Did he really have to go into detail about his own health problems?",

            "Stewart's 'personal journey' format isn't entirely successful, and verges on the egotistical, but the message of this film, and the imagery and statistics it tells it with, is angry, credible and worthwhile.",
            "the 'reality drama' that unfolds on-screen takes viewers away from the real ecological issue (much as it took Stewart away from his diving)",

            "Nanking doesn't tell us why decency and compassion completely break down from time to time. It just tells us something terribly modern and all too familiar.",
            "Anyone who sees Nanking should know going in what a brutal story it is, but no one should miss it because of a restrictive rating.",
            "Nanking does justice to this tragedy even though it makes the mistake of mixing the testimony of actual participants with staged readings from actors subbing for real people.",
            "The filmmakers employ a powerful technique of interspersing newsreel footage with wrenching on-camera interviews of survivors and sequences of actors reciting from the letters and memoirs of the Westerners on the scene.",
            "One of 2007's most important documentaries. ",
            "This painful documentary ends on a hopeful note, although with a clear view of the cloud over human nature.",
            "A noble effort, but a flawed delivery. The film would benefit from more time spent with the real survivors, and less with actors tasked with \"playing\" the Western saviors.",
            "Living through a screening of ... the 1937/8 Japanese invasion, devastation and occupation of Nanking creates a fervent wish to have nothing o do with our membership cards in the homo sapiens species.",
            "A deft and dramatic melding of talking-head documentary, historic photos and film footage and readings by a cast of actors, the film is a devastating depiction of man's inhumanity to man. It is also about how some of us are brave enough to say 'No.'",
            "Nanking bombards you with words and images of acts too barbaric to fully absorb.",
            "Nanking is a sometimes clumsy and sometimes artistically flawed documentary but in the end it presents a powerful account of what happened in Nanking at the end of 1937 and beginning of 1938.",
            "A brutal introduction to events that should be better known.",
            "A handsome documentary on a brutal subject, Nanking delves into the 1937 Japanese invasion of China and the atrocities committed in the attack...",
            "A harrowing look at how war takes its terrible toll on the innocent.",
            "Even as history changes to accommodate current needs and frameworks, it's crucial to remember those who lived it.",
            "Highlights both the best and the worst that humanity has to offer.",
            "I have rarely, if ever, seen a documentary reconstruction of a historical event that is so rich in firsthand (and well-preserved) photographic material."

            "What makes the film so appealing is the disconnect between what comes from the mouths of these hormone-addled pups and what's going on in their heads, where they're still clinging desperately to the innocence they're leaving behind.",
            "[Cera] has some of the best comic timing of anyone working in film today, a precocious sense of the awkward pauses and misread cues in which social panic resides.",
            "This is the funniest picture since Borat, and more emotionally nuanced than you would expect.",
            "If you can stand the predatory assumptions, which are that girls are mere sex objects to most teenage boys, there's much more to this movie than the usual teen comedy. You can't help laughing even as you wince.",
            "The oftentimes outrageous dialogue and vulgar exchanges between stars Michael Cera and Jonah Hill are both wildly hilarious and genuinely portrayed.",
            "An intelligent and occasionally insightful look at the sometimes scary place we call the adolescent male mind.",
            "There are enough laughs to make it worth your time. It may not be super good, but it is good enough.",
            "Hysterically funny and also strangely poignant and heartfelt.",
            "Yes, Superbad is a boy's story, so a certain perspective should be expected, and it's not the cheerful filth that bothers me, nor even the conventional morality; it's the paternalism.",

            "Beneath the swearing and the tampon jokes lies a sweet-hearted tale of three chums celebrating the end of their carefree high-school days.",
            "It's a simple tale about two horny kids not only on a quest for vodka, beer and sticky fumbling, but they're looking to find themselves in the process. I'll be damned if there's many people left in the cinema afterwards who won't relate to that.",
            "Honest goodwill, fond observational detail and Greg Mottola's exuberant direction make the picture nigh on irresistible, but there are some missteps.",
            "The affable trajectory covers enough guffaws to balance out the flattest visuals this side of The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes",
            "Like all Apatow productions, it's far too long but it has a winning combination of cleverly crude humor and genuine sweetness.",
            "With Superbad, Rogen continues to show off his writing skills, delivering one of the most viciously funny movies since Super Troopers.",
            "The comic-duo of Jonah Hill and Michael Cera reminded me of an immature, foul-mouthed Laurel & Hardy.",
            "even if Superbad's not much more than a teen comedy, it's the best teen comedy to come out in at least a decade. There's no shame in that.",

            "Thr3e basically has two modes: boring mode and stupid mode. The film is only 108 minutes long, but I swear there are periods where it felt like it might as well have been 308.",
            "I've seen films that said nothing in entertaining, even compelling ways. 'Thr3e' is not one of them. At least it's not wholesome too.",
            "Ultimately aimed at a Christian audience looking for genre entertainment with a certain sense of propriety, the film tries to serve two masters and doesn't quite deliver for either.",

            "It's relentlessly mediocre and does not belong in a venue where you'll have to pay $9 to see it.",
            "Directed by Robby Henson, this theologically driven thriller from 20th Century Fox's Fox Faith division, steps gingerly around sex and watches its tongue. But it's far too comfy with the lingua franca of American cinema: violence.",
            "It has a triple-twist ending, highly appropriate for a picture whose plot depends on permutations of the number three, and I'll bet at least two of those surprise you.",
            "It's hard to imagine an audience that will be satisfied.",
            "A shaky narrative, clumsy storytelling, and unintentionally campy acting make this a frustrating movie-going experience that's only worth half the stars of its title."

            "The story of these people is certainly engaging. The conundrums of art and reality, of reflection and mirror images, presented by the movie are another matter - they seem at times gratuitous. But at least the movie does give us something to think about.",
            "For all its fuss and fury, Flight of the Red Balloon succeeds magnificently, providing not only an artful homage to Lamorisse's Academy Award-winning short, but also a weightlessly floating tour of the French capital.",
            "More often than not, the red balloon appears as a silent, benevolent witness to ethereal moments that [director] Hou has taken great care to capture.",
            "Plenty of well-meaning filmmakers advertise emotion without contextualizing it. Hou's latest film feels to me like a masterpiece responding intuitively to a masterpiece.",
            "It works especially well when Juliette Binoche is front and center.",

            "While Hou's cinematic techniques are as sound as ever, this time it feels as if they're being used to peer into nothing of particular, specific significance.",
            "As if playing a serenely refined game, Hou transforms constraint into freedom -- which feels more to the point than any plotbound interpretation.",
            "[A] sedate, ever-lovely looking film.",
            "Beautifully shot, but ultimately dull and plot-free drama that's both elusive and frustrating, despite a strong performance from Binoche."

            "What a sorry reunion for Ryder and writer-director Daniel Waters, who scripted her far better dark comedy Heathers back in 1989.",
            "Neither particularly dark nor even remotely funny.",
            "A little bit of love; a lot of laughter and a lot of sex and a lot of..... Sex and Death 101. Mandatory viewing required.",
            "Heaven help a writer who turns a philanderer into a blank.",
            "Admittedly, it doesn't have many belly laughs, but if you're tuned into Waters' peculiar, highly intelligent comedy style it's a fascinating watch.",
            "the monologues near the truly odd ending make you wonder whether Waters had an extreme fever when he was finishing up the script",
            "Sex and Death falls into the category of those unfortunate films in that it's a schoolboy's wet dream slathered in smug self-back patting and wish-fantasy run amok, all told with the deftness of a piano falling out of the sky and onto our heads.",
            "A fun, sloppy treatment of a profound premise that, as a reunion project between Waters and Ryder, feels right.",

            "The film works hard to be a dark, grown up, romantic comedy (plenty of sex, nudity, bad language and philosophy) and yet it winds up being every bit as childish as most other pictures in the genre.",
            "The comedy grows more and more gratingly cynical and unpleasant.",
            "Even if it badly needs editing, runs almost a half-hour too long and chickens out totally in its final scenes, it's still miles above the Hollywood comedy median.",

            "It's got the makings of a wicked little sex romp, but this dull, wordy comedy lacks visual punch and the laser-sharp satire that made the Waters-penned Heathers a mini-classic.",
            "It has some seriously subversive ambitions, wanting to take that most popular of genres, the funny romantic romp, and turn it into a black comedy, stripping away the sweetness while keeping the laughs. Nice idea, bad execution, worse result."

            "An unremarkable revenge/chase western, bolstered by its name cast, matter-of-fact violence and Toll's pristine photography. Eventually a little pretentious - with Anjelica Huston's cameo the nadir - but if you love oaters, it's just worth the time.",

            "[Director Julien Temple] stops short of hagiography, while exhaustively positing Strummer as one of the most important cultural figures of the 20th century.",
            "Temple gets at the heart of Strummer's character, at the unbridled joy that existed within his righteous anger, the satisfaction of knowing he was on the right side of history and hadn't had to sell any part of himself to get there.",
            "The film is the work of an admirer, but not an uncritical one.",

            "Future is overlong and will best be enjoyed and understood by fans, but even newcomers will appreciate the essential drive of the man, who died of a sudden heart attack in 2002, and admire his ability to balance anger and ecstasy.",
            "The story illustrates how easily political art can be hijacked by the other side, and it illuminates the anguish of a man who spent the last 20 years of his life wrestling with his legacy.",
            "'Should you stay or should you go' really is the ultimate question.",

            "The twist ending that softens the blow of this otherwise unique and atmospheric work is not for me to ruin, but it should be said that it shows a chink in the filmmaker's armor",
            "A strange blend of corporate thriller and supernatural mystery.",
            "While too lean and unassuming to provide real chills, Yella is a cool, disorienting trip, a meditation on death and the complexity of the human brain.",

            "The film feels far too schematic and, even allowing for its unrelentingly mercenary premise, far too cold to inspire much viewer identification.",

            "A large number of idiosyncratic and deadpan supporting characters provides amusement around dispirited women floating through sweetly satisfying meanderings.",
            "A film that is fresh in both style and story.",
            "...the contrivances ... allow the filmmakers to tell the stories of a number of different characters who would otherwise have no business being in the same film.",
            "The directors infuse the film with a short story's spare dialogue and tight pacing -- the running time is all of 76 minutes -- while subtle visual motifs and judicious moments of magical realism demonstrate cinema at its most elegant.",
            "Although its title might have some assuming this is a cheap remake of a bad horror B movie from the '50s, Jellyfish is actually quite a reflective and pensive picture.",
            "Although the \"hyperlink\" drama that features a lot of interconnecting storylines has become a common staple of the arthouse, \"Jellyfish\" manages to be a weird and memorable creature all its own.",
            "It's a wisp of a thing, but it's a lovely wisp.",
            "These interlocking stories don't add up to a conventional narrative. It helps to think of Jellyfish as a tone poem. And like the invertebrate that is its namesake, the film is by turns beautiful, stinging and rather shapeless.",
            "Light on its feet, deeply human, and fresh in style, this French-Israeli co-production serves up an engaging tale about a group of women struggling with daily life in contemporary Tel Aviv."

            "Wagner has turned the page on a promising career, and it will be exciting to see what the next chapter brings.",

            "By and large, Starting Out in the Evening is smart and considered and grown-up and credibly human filmmaking.",

            "A stunning work, a transcendent, nearly spiritual experience, from the breathtaking opening shot to the haunting final frame.",
            " The sound of silence... Indulging in few words and even fewer edits, Carlos Reygadas lets his luminous images do the talking as he ponders the human condition and more. Some viewers will cry with boredom; true believers will shed tears of pain and joy.",
            "The opening six-minute shot of dawn breaking over a rural landscape is worth the price of admission alone. Stunning.",

            "To mention Carlos Reygadas' winsome Silent Light in the same breath as key directors Carl Theodor Dreyer, Andrei Tarkovsky, Robert Bresson, and the more recent Bruno Dumont is not hyperbole.",
            "If Reygadas has ever subscribed to Bresson's philosophy of narrative structure, it's here in Silent Light, with its grueling emotional escalation leading up to a peak of exquisite release.",
            "He's made, unprecedentedly, a movie that's almost entirely literal even when it's being fantastical, a liberty made possible by the closed-off world Reygadas has found. And if it's a knock-out, I'm still skeptical and puzzled as to what's behind it.",

            "Alone with Her has a dog and a rampant sense of dread, the kind you don't recover from for at least a few days. I'm on the first day.",
            "exudes the overall uncomfortable air of watching a depraved home movie",
            "Alone With Her is a tense, well-shot little thriller in the vein of 'fatal attraction' youth flicks like Fear, The Crush, and Swimfan.",
            "Through Hanks' and Talancon's subtle, naturalistic performance [writer-director Eric Nicholas] cultivates a human dimension often missing from thrillers.",
            "For all its technological ingenuity, however, the film is ultimately a fairly routine stalker thriller that soon becomes repetitive in its contrivances. And the footage, necessarily shot on digital video, is not particularly easy to watch.",

            "Ten may strain your patience but that's the high-stakes gamble of this provocative project.",
            "A conceptual tour de force and a brainiac's road movie, Abbas Kiarostami's Ten goes from chilly abstraction to hot emotion in less than 60 seconds.",
            "It shows us, in an extraordinarily simple way, the hopes and frustrations of one woman's life.",
            "Often provokes humor and refreshing insights.",

            "Who would have thought a movie centered on a driver and her passengers that never leaves the car could be so compellingly watchable? Ten is not only a fascinating character study, but a portrait of an entire way of life.",
            "A little more reach would have allowed Ten to turn it up to 11.",
            "Whatever the film lacks in physical lyricism, it makes up for with a claustrophobic flair that leads you to conclude that Ten can be the loneliest number.",
            "Works in its own mysterious ways.",
            "For little more than the price of a tank of gas and a video camera, Kiarostami lets his viewers drive a mile in another's shoes. It's not often that a road trip is so educational.",

            "Very soon it's clear that even from a camera trained on the front seat of a car, an amazingly full and complex portrait of Iranian life can emerge."

            "National Lottery money and Venice Film Festival Silver Lion awards should be going to much more thoughtful films than this.",

            "Feels contrived and serves to highlight the limitations of the no-name cast.",
            "An interesting failure, De Palma's film starts well and has moments of exceptional power but ultimately loses itself in its rambling structure. If you haven't already seen it, you'd probably be better off going back to De Palma's Casualties Of War, which",
            "Abrave film for De Palma, obviously deeply felt, but the final scene - a steady collage of real pictures of victims of the conflict - offer a more visceral pull than anything that has gone before.",

            "Christopher Zalla, a graduate of the film program at Columbia University, makes an impressive debut with this suspense feature about illegal immigrants and stolen identity.",
            "[Director Christopher] Zalla may have provided his characters with a overly constructed tragedy, but his eye for city life and his seeming gift with actors promises astute, generous work to come.",
            "Stumbles through a maddening screenplay but nevertheless generates true emotional energy.",
            "[Director Christopher] Zalla keeps the tension high through a taut story rather than through manipulative, obtrusive thriller direction.",
            "Plot flaws and all, we can be glad that the picture was made -- because of its acting.",
            "Shot mainly in New York's meanest, murkiest streets, Sangre de Mi Sangre, is intricately and imaginatively structured, building to a powerful climax of complex irony.",
            "Well-acted and gripping, Sangre de mi Sangre augurs well for Zalla's career.",
            "Eventually, of course, all the characters will have to collide for a final reckoning, but that moment strains credulity to the breaking point and sabotages the entire enterprise",
            "It's the relationships between the characters, layered and emotional, that saves Sangre from itself.",
            "There's nothing easy about Christopher Zalla's very good film, a story that will get under your skin in its depiction of the dark underbelly of the American dream.",
            "A moving story combined with first rate acting and a great screenplay by a new, but determined, writer/director make this an indie film not to be missed. Modern film noir from the streets of Mexico to the streets of America.",
            "Zalla utilizes both the dark back streets of New York and the dark nature of some humans to weave an intoxicating tale of stolen identity and pilfered emotions.",
            "Zalla wants to know the point where boys become cynics, men become vultures, and the hardened become vulnerable.",
            "Sangre De Mi Sangre could have done without a few plot coincidences and the film's relentless mean street look seems studied at times. But the film's behavioral honesty pumps vibrant, undeniable life through every frame.",
            "Stands out from the recent wave of movies about the plight of immigrants coming to the United States...because it's more suspenseful than heart-tugging.",
            "A suspenseful movie with no intention of sugarcoating the daily hardships of New York's underclass.",
            "Although it exhibits a heartfelt connection with the city's half-invisible population of illegal immigrants, its myriad inconsistencies and strained plotting are increasingly frustrating.",
            "The grimy elegance of this Sundance award winner elevates it well above the standard-issue immigrant drama.",
            "[Director] Zalla prefers to wallow in the dead-end, an approach that's initially powerful, then numbing.",
            "A gritty and poignant Mexican drama about the search for family.",
            "To write Sangre off as an unglamorous fairytale devalues what screenwriter/director Zalla achieves."

            "[Assayas] has concocted a plot that is dizzying and annoying at times, and it's hard to care about the characters in the shifting story. But B-movie veteran Argento's portrayal of Sandra is like watching a car careening down an incline.",

            "Although Honeydripper won a screenplay award at the San Sebasti\u00e1n Film Festival, it's not Sayles' strongest work. Part of the problem is that it keeps building to a rock-'n'-roll payoff that never quite arrives.",
            "Trudging nobly under a mantle of impeccably earnest intentions and a fussy, too-quaint-by-half production design, Honeydripper lags and drags to its utterly predictable end. There's not a spark of spontaneity or soul about it.",
            "It has all the reliable components of Sayles' films: a strong social conscience; well-drawn characters whose lives overlap convincingly; a languid pace that allows for the honest unfolding of their foibles and fears; a vivid evocation of a place and time.",
            "Like a rich and fading tapestry, the film successfully manages to create a lost world, a lost time.",

            "The movie's breezy, blood-flecked entertainment, with no aim other than to give you a giggle and a shriek.",
            "Fido is a one-joke movie with some good performances and a few good gross-out moments. But it's not dark enough or sick enough to be a cult favorite.",
            "In the ticklishly amusing satire Fido, the undead stagger along like stunned toddlers.",
            "Fido does offer a good number of laughs, along with a healthy serving of gore to satisfy horror fans.",
            "Enslaved, exploited and feared, the zombies stand in for a long history of African-American objectification and subjugation in a white-dominated, patriarchal United States, while also satirising contemporary obsessions with home security. ",
            "Fido tries very hard to keep the tone light, but it doesn't succeed in meshing hilarity and horror: the more disturbing ideas it's messing about with poke through.",
            "Subtle? No, but it's clever and funny in a thoroughly reimagined alternate universe, where the paternal smiles of authority figures hide an unchecked police state keeping the gated communities white, middle class, and compliant. ",
            "Pretty funny, surprisingly smart, pleasant to look at, and often quite sick.",
            "Andrew Currie's script incisively observes how taboo preferences have become policies in the reality \"Fido\" creates. Macabre and satirical with the brash brio of all great zombie movies, \"Fido\" understands that the true ghouls' hearts are still beating.",
            "Surprisingly gentle in most of its humor and its gore quotient, making you wonder who exactly it was aimed at.",
            "Fido finds a new wrinkle in the nearly exhausted zombie genre.",
            "This set-up sounds like an amusing premise for a mild little low-budget spoof, but Fido is much more than that: it's a full-blown social satire with zombies at its center.",
            "The filmmakers get darkly amusing mileage out of the notion of tamed zombies in suburbian servitude",
            "fun",

            "Fido is a fetching comedy with tongue-in-cheek social commentary and a quick wit.",
            "One senses that zombie film kingpin George A. Romero, who satirized consumerism in \"Dawn of the Dead,\" would smile like a proud papa if he saw it.",
            "Starts with an excellent idea, but doesn't carry it far enough",
            "If this movie's concept appeals to you at all, I urge you to reward the filmmakers by seeing in the theatre if at all possible. It's so small but so special. For you zombie fans, it's a great dessert after all the carnage, but it still delivers what we",
            "Fido's humor comes from the clash of genres: bright cheery Americana butting up against the death and destruction of zombie horror."

            "Charles Burnett still hasn't gotten his due... In spite of his later difficulties, Burnett's first feature-his thesis film at UCLA-Killer of Sheep (1978), has gone on to influence quite a few artists in the late 20th and early 21st century.",

            "The fantastic thing about this beautiful film is how little it tries to make a statement about anything; it is, simply, life.",

            "Progressive clergy provide enough historical context to neutralize the handful of Bible verses prohibiting homosexual acts, but Karslake never confronts the broader issues of sexuality and procreation that bedevil even moderate Christians.",

            "Daniel Karslake's remarkable documentary boldly takes on a loaded topic -- Christianity and homosexuality -- and examines it both intellectually and emotionally; the result may well leave you blinking away a few tears.",
            "A brisk, entertaining and even moving exploration of the sometimes frayed intersection where Christianity meets homosexuality.",
            "Its main surprise is the compassion shown toward everyone, on all sides of the debate. It does not vilify those who vilify gays.",
            "While the film is unlikely to sway anyone whose mind already isn't made up, it provides plenty food for thought in its examination of biblical doctrine on same-sex love and how it resonates to this day.",
            "The documentary takes a witty and compassionate view of what coming out in a religious family feels like, both to adult gay kids and their bewildered parents. ",
            "A masterfully crafted, deeply moving work that could spark much needed conversations. ",
            "Karslake reveals ways Scripture has been used to discriminate against homoexuality, and shows how inaccurate interpretations of the Bible cause widespread despair and the destruction of lives.",
            "Excessivamente convencional em sua estrutura e contendo sua parcela de graves trope\u00e7os (a seq\u00fc\u00eancia em anima\u00e7\u00e3o), este filme ainda assim merece aplausos pela eloq\u00fc\u00eancia de seus entrevistados, pelo teor de sua mensagem e pela paix\u00e3o com que a defende.",
            "One message rings clear throughout the occasionally muddled but always emotionally sweeping film: A true abomination is twisting the words of Scripture to match bigotry.",
            "A thoughtful look at the complicated relationship between Christianity and homosexuality.",
            "The film offers proof that religion and homosexuality need not be mutually exclusive: Good Christians can love and accept their gay brothers and sisters, and gay people can still be religious.",
            "A gut-wrenching depiction of what truly defines Family Values.",
            "The movie's serious, wide-ranging look at a divisive subject is not guaranteed to settle disputes, only to prompt discussion.",
            "An informative, heartbreaking documentary about intolerance and manipulation, sadly and assuredly never to be seen by the people who need this info the most.",
            "The Bible Tells Me So",
            "If imperfect, the film is also necessary.",
            "For the Bible Tells Me So is a great documentary and an even better motion picture, and as a testament to faith and family I can't imagine a finer example than this.",
            "Could hardly be called even-handed, and it's certainly repetitive, but despite its failings it's still worth seeing--as so often, especially by those who probably won't."

            "Too often with documentaries, we get only the tears. There is no second act or resolution. Christopher Quinn's God Grew Tired of Us gives us reason to hope about a human catastrophe.",
            "Not as good, nor as complex, as The Lost Boys, but that doesn't make the story of mass annihilation, sprawling refugee camps, the generosity of Americans, and the resilience of a handful of Sudanese survivors any less worthy of telling -- again.",
            "There's no way to not like [John] Dau. Or for that matter, God Grew Tired of Us.",
            "Their journey isn't over -- many in Africa still desperately need help -- but the hope and opportunities America offers are a grand place to start.",
            "Can there really be no footage of their uncertainty, anger at unfriendly Americans, even an embrace of bad habits?",
            "This moving documentary by Christopher Quinn vividly contrasts the material hunger of the third world (on the plane trip over the men devour the condiments included with their airline meal) and the spiritual starvation of the first world.",
            "Admittedly amusing fish-out-of-water moments are nothing compared to what the boys face as they try to adapt to a wildly foreign culture.",
            "It's an uplifting last act, though not one that comes with solutions to an Africa that seems to cough up one genocide after another. Personal redemption and hope aren't a cure-all, but they do shine a light in the darkness.",
            "The Lost Boys' gratitude for simple things will humble those of us accustomed to comfort and opportunity. Their endurance, ambition, and compassion should inspire us.",
            "A thought-provoking film likely to make moviegoers question their own paths in life even as it involves them in the lives of several of the 'Lost Boys' of Sudan...",
            "God Grew Tired of Us is a better film than Lost Boys of Sudan, focusing on details of the men's lives and shifting fluidly between three distinct \"characters\": John, Daniel and Panther.",
            "The film's subjects display impressive adaptability, as well as a desire not to forget those they've left behind. The emotional high point is a miraculous reunion between one of the 'Lost Boys' and the mother he'd had no contact with for 17 years.",
            "It deflates upon arriving in the vast, familiar blandness we know as America.",
            "Christopher Quinn and Tommy Walker made this fine and never simply pleading film, its moving subjects including tall, gentle, tireless, prayerful and humane John Bul Dau.",
            "In an age where xenophobia is rife, God Grew Tired of Us presents the opposite side of the coin.",
            "A beautiful documentary, deserving of its Sundance Grand Jury Prize and Audience Awards.",
            "Not quite intimate, the film can only hint at its subjects' depths of pain and strength, inviting them to remember and observing as they grapple with the perversities of life in the States.",
            "[A] simple and direct documentary.",
            "Satisfying enough to demonstrate that some stories deserve to be told more than once.",
            "The film affirms that if it is possible to survive when you have lost your home, family, and country, it is possible to start over and prevail.",
            "About the untold ways in which males can and have nurtured one another in ways that build and create a sense of family and community.",
            "If you've seen Lost Boys Of Sudan, much of this will seem familiar. It's basically different boys and a little star-power backing. If you haven't seen their story, it's worth a look."

            "Theroux brings none of the electric surprise or intensity of his acting to bear on the movie. He seems unhappy with the assignment.",
            "Dedication's problem isn't its idealized conception of love but the thoroughly unconvincing way in which it is realized.",
            "That's what it takes to make it through this self-consciously dark romantic comedy.",
            "It restores one's faith in Mandy Moore's film career.",
            "Theroux shoots and edits creatively, and elicits good performances, so here's hoping he gets another crack behind the camera with a more cohesive and consistent script.",

            "Crudup delivers a bracing, uncompromising performance, but it's unmistakably a solo turn in a romantic comedy that's supposed to be about the blurring of egos and the fusing of two idiosyncratic voices into a single harmonious duet.",
            "Crudup exhibits admirable restraint. The story would be more compelling, however, had we not seen the same thing before in As Good as It Gets.",
            "Dedication is engaging for a while, but flits from style to style, from dark to loopy comedy, only to settle on gooey romance.",
            "Gratingly hip, joyless, small-budget Dedication is just another example of what New Yorker magazine recently identified as the 'slacker-striver' trope in today's romances.",
            "A film that subjects us to one of the more irritating and unlikable leading men in recent romantic comedy history.",

            "almost impossible to admire as a whole.",

            "Writer-director Bahman Ghobadi's picturesque road trip is less about preserving a musical heritage than accepting one's fate, a mythic trek that's both heartrending and boisterous -- often as hauntingly absurdist as a Kusturica carnival.",

            "The killing of 24 Iraqi civilians by U.S. marines in November 2005 is still so clouded by cover-up that the last thing anyone needs now is an improvised drama about the tragedy by UK gonzo documentarian Nick Broomfield.",
            "This film by Nick Broomfield, which superficially resembles Brian De Palma's Redacted in that it is a mockumentary based on real, horrible events, is a 90-minute libel against the Marine Corps.",

            "It's a return to the dreamy style of Tsai's studies in urban alienation and social disconnection, in which feelings often are suppressed and words are rarely spoken...",
            "Tsai's drama is something like a mixture of Robert Bresson and R.W. Fassbinder, as God's bedraggled souls struggle with the desires of the damned, and nobody wants to go into that good night alone.",
            "For Tsai's fans, Sleep offers many pleasures, including a heightened attention to nocturnal beauty and a gorgeous, uncharacteristic surrealism.",
            "It takes some careful attention and a not insignificant amount of patience, but if you can modify your expectations accordingly, Sleep is a highly rewarding experience.",
            "I Don't Want to Sleep Alone is a title to keep in mind while absorbing this allusive, humid mood piece.",
            "The longing is palpable, for love and for just companionship. In this languorous world, the drama's title speaks volumes. No one wants to sleep alone."

            "Thanks to its subtle touches and strong character development, Bridge to Terabithia is not only entertaining for the family but for anyone who wants to leave reality behind for a little while.",
            "Bridge to Terabithia is a brave film but a disturbing one, and even though it is inspired by real-life events, it feels like a cheat.",

            "The first of a two-part film about the life of an 11th-century Tibetan mystic, Milarepa evokes a time when sorcery was a poor man's way of making war, and the sight of yogis flying through the sky was commonplace.",

            "[The] restrained, elliptical style, focused on details rather than confrontations, and the nuanced performances make this house a home.",
            "Teixeira brings his camera into her home and quietly records the details of her daily life. The result is a carefully observed film about one woman's growing dissatisfaction.",
            "[Director Chico] Texeira's ordinary characters have a quiet genuineness and clarity that is rare anywhere in movies these days.",
            "Documentarian Chico Teixeira's first narrative film is casual but busy, and though it seems somewhat longer than its 90-minute running time, the quiet characterizations soon get their hooks into you.",
            "In her first leading role, Carla Ribas joins the fast-growing ranks of middle-aged Latina actresses whose performances resonate with a beguiling mixture of emotional complexity and sexual maturity.",
            "Ribas has justifiably won a shelf of awards for her portrayal.",
            "The juiciest bits happen off camera, yet their consequences are riveting, thanks in no small measure to sympathetic performances by Carla Ribas and Berta Zemel.",
            "The gritty location shooting, the absence of a soundtrack and the casting of non-professionals in key roles help capture an all-important sense of place with almost documentary precision.",

            "Hartley pretzels his faux spy plot into \"Syriana\"-like knots and ends up with a fascinating if somewhat flawed absurdist romp.",

            "It's odd, endearing and weirdly funny for an hour, and after that it's a bit of a self-conscious mess.",
            "Overall, though, Fay Grim only occasionally connects with the viewer. It is a film so caught up in its own cleverness and cheekiness that -- despite the solid work by its cast -- it forgets to make you truly care about its characters.",
            "The story is deliberately perplexing, and while the logic of the serpentine narrative surely makes sense, Hartley is more concerned with the cadences and rhythms of the spy movie itself.",

            "The real world needs more dogged folks willing to tilt at windmills. But movies often don't do their stories justice, and that has happened again here.",
            "Pimentel's persistence and eventual triumph over prejudice and discrimination is a story worth telling, if only on a shoestring.",
            "Salawich's film is entertaining and leaves you with warm feelings from learning about this man who turned adversity into good for so many others.",
            "This offbeat biopic is driven by Ron Livingston's engaging performance as Richard Pimentel, a gifted public speaker who lost his hearing in the Vietnam war and then spearheaded the disability rights movement in the U.S.",
            "This is a nice little well-meaning idea for a movie, but even with three writers on the payroll, it never really catches fire.",
            "I wanted to like this film",
            "Low on drama, but funny, with interesting characters, good performances and is uplifting without being too sweet.",
            "It's just too bad that the pious treatment given the deserving Pimentel never translated into a more engaging film.",
            "With period songs galore to tell you exactly what's going on inside protagonist Richard Pimentel (Ron Livingston), you hardly need plot or dialogue.",
            "It gives me no pleasure to report that the [Richard] Pimentel biopic Music Within plays like a well-intentioned TV movie.",
            "If you're looking for one-dimensional, uplifting pap, Music Within fits the bill. It's watchable. Pimentel is obviously a really interesting guy, and it's a shame his tale wasn't told with a bit more flair.",
            "...an agreeable though entirely uneven piece of work...",
            "When the subject is not well-known, and the film about his life is unremarkable, the whole thing starts to feel like an exercise in futility.",
            "Both Pimental and the audience would have been better served if his life were told as a PBS documentary.",
            "The low-budget Music Within may not entirely work on the outside, but at its core beats a very funny, very smart and very moving heart of gold.",
            "This is a heroic tale in many respects, but it's handled here with the heavy hand of television-quality hagiography.",
            "It hits some of the right notes, but at the wrong time and the overall effect is a song out of tune.",
            "Second-time director Steven Sawalich's \"music\" presumably still resides inside him because it doesn't resound in his Music Within message movie.",
            "Leaves no cliche unturned and has no point of view.",
            "All inspiring stuff, but Music Within is strictly by the numbers, even down to the predictable mood-setting period soundtrack numbers",
            "Music Within never establishes a consistent tone, going from achingly sincere to borderline farcical, often in the same scene."

            "After 40 minutes of schoolgirl and schoolboy reminiscences, and the filmmaker's attempts to filter history through nostalgia, the documentary is about as appealing as a home movie.",
            "In its poignant depiction of a Cuban generation convinced that their roles as creators of a brighter tomorrow can only be fulfilled elsewhere, the director's personal investigation into her past forcefully conveys a sense of national betrayal."

            "It's a fittingly loose, shambling little nothing of a comedy that's occasionally inspired, but at least a draft or two short of its potential. Still, it's a pleasure to watch Faris wander slack-jawed through a surreal day in Los Angeles.",

            "The real key to the film is the commanding Michael Shannon.",
            "The end reveals just how poetic, shifting and dazzling Nichols' touch was all along. That's because Shotgun Stories manages to pull away from a hair-trigger resolution with the same inherent right-ness that loaded the story with such tragic force."

            "Using the talents of John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson, H\u00e5fstr\u00f6m makes a creepshow out of King's short story, doing justice to it completely.",
            "A nifty, shifty and refreshingly gore-free horror film...",
            "1408 feels like a classic, well-acted haunted house tale. It may not go very deep with some of the bigger questions it asks, but it is interesting that it bothers to ask them.",
            "A sharp and well paced horror film with heavy overtones of grief, anguish, and horrors of the real world that we sometimes unfortunately can never conquer.",
            "An excursion through the psychological intrigue of the human mind that is precise, tense, atmospheric and performed with great dramatic intensity.",
            "Definitely one of the best King adaptations in years ... and I've seen 'em all.",
            "Like shacking up with a cheap hooker in a moderately priced hotel, 1408 delivers dirty thrills with few frills.",
            "Another actor may have made 1408 seem as thin and fake as an episode of Tales from the Crypt, but Cusack lends it that badly needed extra milligram of conviction.",
            "1408 is another Stephen King adaptation where the main protagonist is a writer. It is also a fine psychological horror movie and welcome change of pace from the ultra violent, gore polluted, torture porn flicks currently infecting cinema. ",
            "The success of 1408 rests squarely on [John Cusack's] Hawaiian shirt-clad shoulders, and he pulls it off. The role, that is. The tacky shirt stays on pretty well the whole time.",
            "A good, old-fashioned horror flick, one that relies on supernatural chills, psychological twists and top-shelf special effects -- as opposed to the recent trend toward ball gags, bound wrists and bad lighting.",
            "Cusack's gritty, near over-the-top performance goes a long way, as does the subtle slow burn from director Mikael H\u00e5fstr\u00f6m, but Samuel L. Jackson needed to be nudged awake as the hotel manager.",
            " Forcing the audience to experience his terror with an almost first-hand immediacy, Cusack runs the emotional gamut ...",
            "Una buena idea y unos 20 minutos iniciales inquietantes y sugestivos se descarrilan r\u00e1pidamente hacia la parafernalia y el exceso visual. Nada convence, excepto el esfuerzo de John Cusack por convencernos de que se lo ha tomado en serio.",
            "From the start, it builds to a point of unbearable tension and then rewards us with a payoff that is cleverly executed and genuinely terrifying.",
            "I'm very hard to please when it comes to the horror genre, but pleased I am with 1408, a dread concoction from Stephen King, sharply committed to film by a clever screenplay, solid direction and terrific performances."

            "Written and directed by Rajnesh Domalpalli as his graduate thesis at Columbia University, Vanaja is an engaging and shocking look at class, gender roles and sexuality in rural India.",
            "I wish that I could also highlight the film as the best thesis film I saw in 2007, but with Charles Burnett's Killer of Sheep re-released earlier this year, Vanaja unfortunately has to settle for second place.",
            "Vanaja, a film exploring the tensions of the caste system in contemporary rural India, boasts a compelling story on-screen and off.",
            "[Domalpalli] adds to the glory of contemporary Indian cinema, indeed all cinema, with the humanity of his vision, healthily unbridled sensuality and fluid technique.",

            "Simultaneously resigned, frustrated, cautiously hopeful, angry and ravishingly beautiful, this story of an impoverished country girl who tries to better herself through Indian classical dance is a stunning debut for writer-director Rajnesh Domalpalli.",

            "Mr. Brisseau honors the infinitely varying psyches of his female subjects. One may scoff at his voyeuristic self-indulgence, but when you come right down to it, isn't that what the cinema is all about, one way or another?",
            "A complex, confessional examination of [Jean-Claude Brisseau's] twisted, thorny and ultimately ambiguous feelings toward women and sex.",

            "It's hard to tell if Brisseau is a raging misogynist or a radical feminist, and what makes the movie interesting is that he's probably a little bit of both.",

            "What starts as a taut urban crime drama quickly sags into lurid after-school-special sentimentality.",
            "Has no shortage of heart, but it has been so clumsily organized and falls back so often on clich\u00e9d storytelling that any early goodwill quickly morphs into resentment.",

            "The picture is being re-released in 30 cities around the country before finally appearing on DVD after years of online foment from fans.The DVD is due in May, but try to catch it in theaters first. It's worth it.",
            "Burton is extraordinary in one of his rare good movie roles and O'Toole is regally madcap and larger than life.",
            "The pleasure of these two extravagantly gifted actors at the top of their game -- their diction! their conviction! their beauty! -- is enormous.",
            "Worth a look... for a single performance:... Peter O'Toole as Becket's king, Henry II.",
            "Just as the characters' loyalties to one another are called into question, so, too are ours: Becket enters a moral grey area from which it never fully emerges.",
            "Becket is a terrific example of the historical play or novel turned into a cinematic drama crackling with whip-smart dialogue. I imagine actors must go mad with delight when they read a script that has page after page of dialogue this good.",
            "it finds what's compelling about that history and, more importantly, what's compelling about the people in that history. And, just to be on the safe side, it throws in two of the greatest actors of the day.",
            "The respectable but boring film is nevertheless worth watching for the robust performances of Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole",
            "The material remains relevant, and the film as a whole is completely engrossing. (It may be nearly 2 1/2 hours long, but it doesn't feel like it.)",
            "Watching Becket is to see a form of stylized, epic moviemaking not practiced today.",
            "This adaptation of Anouilh's play about the relationship of Henry II and Becket is well acted by O'Toole and Burton, both Oscar-nominated.",
            "O'Toole just keeps turning up the volume, and it's thrilling to watch.",
            "Peter O'Toole plays Henry like Ian McKellan doing a camp cameo.",
            "Peter Glenville's stage-plank direction creaks badly, but the acting still holds you.",
            "A power play about power plays, Jean Anouilh's now-classic Becket provided the basis for one of the great screen pairings.",
            "While peripheral elements of Becket do show their age, the core of the film's appeal remains incandescent, and that is the on-screen collaboration between Burton and O'Toole.",
            "Most of the dialogue-driven scenes are a series of two-shots; which is great in seeing the sparks fly between two of the leading British actors of their generation, but plodding when it comes to pace.",
            "In 1964, the film's innuendo might have seemed daring; today it's close to ridiculous.",
            "Becket shows us a conflict that has more meaning for the heart than for the head. It is not a conflict to stand as a tempest violent and unforgettable, after 800 years.",
            "A finely crafted piece of period storytelling.",
            "What we have here is a solid five stars worth of acting talent in a slightly shaky four stars worth of movie."

            "With Postal, Boll clearly set out to make history's most offensive, hateful movie. As is his custom, he failed spectacularly.",
            "Postal goes from offensive 9/11 comedy (window washers on the WTC) to trailer-park crudity and back with no rhyme or reason.",
            "Convinced that Arab terrorists are inherently hilarious, and that shooting fish in the leaky barrel of American pop culture takes marksmanship, Boll is a boor, and a symptom of something sad and dehumanizing.",
            "If this movie had been made by an unknown young director, a lot of critics would still be panning the movie for its inconsistencies -- but many others would be praising his courage.",
            "Postal strikes me as marginally superior to Morgan Spurlock's merely boneheaded Where in the World Is Osama bin Laden? But that's like saying Moe is smarter than Curly.",
            "It's hard to imagine a worse movie will come out this year, and yet Boll's growing notoriety has already earned the trailer millions of hits on YouTube. Ed Wood never had it so good.",
            "The German Mr. Boll and the Canadian Mr. Knight seem to want to comment on American culture, but their bystander perspectives clearly do nothing to inform them how to maximize their material.",
            "A bad movie based on a lousy video game. It barely works as a satire, and as a comedy only managed to extract a couple of laughs out of me. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Although the best parts of Postal seem driven by a committed cast and a fearless sense of juvenile experimentation, there's little here that's consistently funny or original.",
            "The end result is a film that feels as though it's been conceived and executed by a third grader...",
            "Most of the outrageousness is outrageous for the sake of being so outrageous.",
            "Boll mistakes shock for satire and crudity for cleverness in this desperately unfunny, hopelessly clueless catalogue of the ills of America... that ends up rejoicing in what it believes it is sending up.",
            "The second half of the movie is a mess with only light humor and some audacious bits to liven up the mood.",
            "I guess you could call it a \"satire,\" but it doesn't particularly care to take the time or energy to spin the satire in any meaningful way; it merely thunders over all its ideas like a rabid elephant.",
            "Boll's self-inflicted dose of Schadenfreude is the only sure shot in this miserable misfire of a satire, which aims for \"campy,\" but hits \"crappy\" instead.",
            "Is it funny? Not really, but it has isolated flashes of inspiration. Elsewhere, the film is a jumbled, needlessly violent mess, sloppily edited and feckless in its attempts at political satire.",
            "Almost worth watching because it's so unbelievably abysmal that you can't believe any filmmaker, let alone one as hated as Dr. Boll, would deliberately make light of such subjects in order to shock and offend.",
            "Fearlessness isn't inherently funny: Postal's touches of wit are lost in the flying body parts, gross-out gags, and the full frontal spectacle of Foley's no-longer-private parts.",
            "Quickly, the film turns nihilistic and very nasty.",
            "Postal is largely just a byproduct of Boll's self-promotion, rendering the film itself, in essence, beside the point.",
            "In short, we have a trainwreck of a comedy that goes on far longer than you'd care to watch an actual trainwreck, trying too hard to be offensive the entire time and delivering its jokes with the timing of a 2-year-old with a mixing spoon and a soup-pot.",
            "Infantile, irreverent and boorish to the max, Postal explodes with bad attitude and lousy filmmaking.",
            "This reviewer is not easy to offend, but is very easy to bore. And I was bored out of my tree for most of Boll's lamely conceived, clich\u00e9-ridden debacle.",
            "Indeed, Postal is THAT kind of movie, one that substitutes rancor for real wit, that utilizes splatter when a few script rewrites would have worked much better."

            "Engaging, frequently amusing and occasionally moving documentary about one of fashion's most fascinating figures.",

            "Will have fashion mavens squawking for weeks.",
            "Lagerfeld could be the fashion world's Nosferatu: gimlet eyes hidden behind shades as they appraise each new collection; monstrous in his egotism; and, despite his protestations otherwise, painfully lonely after selling his soul to haute couture.",
            "The problem with Rodolphe Marconi naming his documentary Lagerfeld Confidential is that he's promising more than he can deliver.",
            "Apart from a few too many longueurs of Lagerfeld shooting pretty pictures of pretty models, [the film] is an entertaining bauble."

            "Less a movie than an illustrated audiotape, Kurt Cobain: About a Son is nonetheless fascinating for what it reveals of its subject,",
            "This isn't so much a movie documentary as it is an audio book with visuals.",
            "The images combine with Cobain's voiceover for a cumulative effect that seeps into the film rather than exploding onto it.",
            "Filmmaker AJ Schnack uses 25-hours of previously unheard audio interviews with Cobain as voice over for footage of Cobain haunts. The images are mesmerizing, but Cobain never appears on screen, and he is missed. ",
            "As an illustrated audio tour through the life of a gifted but self-destructive performer, 'About a Son' is enlightening to a point, but one has to wonder when filmmakers will stop exhuming the corpse of a man who desperately craved privacy.",
            "AJ Schnack's Kurt Cobain: About a Son is as gripping and revealing as Gus Van Sant's Last Days was hollow and pointless.",
            "Shaped from Cobain's own words, the film tells his story with care, in inventive style and without phony reverence or pretentious pronouncements.",
            "Most of the material has never been made public before, so the movie is a must-see for Cobain fans. Even for non-fans, it is quite an astonishing document. Up to a point.",
            "Allows the fans that the legendary musician will keep gathering for decades to come a brief look inside Cobain's troubled mind, and it does so in a refreshingly bold and innovative way.",
            "A fascinating plunge into one man's thicket of contradictions.",
            "There is much to fault in this tedious exercise in pseudo-hipster cool masquerading as, well, what exactly?",
            "Startlingly de-mythologizing at first, then just plain poignant . . . it's fascinating to reconcile Cobain's slacker howl over chipping guitar chords with a sodden Pacific Northwest of logging trucks and fishing boats.",
            "Many of the images aren't particularly compelling and neither, frankly, are Cobain's comments, which range from dull anti-press diatribes to familiar stories about the musical influence of his Aunt Mary to inarticulate blather.",
            "It's easy to get lost in his words, especially if you're a fan. I ended up enjoying the film overall, even if I had to wonder whether Cobain himself would have approved of a film like this.",
            "Cobain narrates the tale of his all-too-short life, musing on his successes, loves, letdowns, motivations and depression.",
            "The unique style of the film makes it a music and art house fan's must and, if you are a fan of Kurt Cobain, yours too.",
            "...essential viewing for any real fan of the man and his music and an artfully unique take on the musical biographical documentary genre."

            "Heartfelt it clearly is. Disciplined and focused on what's truly intriguing about the story, not so much.",
            "On the basis of this film, Monty Lapica, at 24, has a career ahead of him as a director, an actor or both. He also has a life ahead of him, which the film does a great deal to make clear.",
            "The movie slides toward melodrama with some stale business about the hero spreading his late father's ashes and an embarrassing sequence in which a homeless man washes Lapica's car, delivers a benediction, and magically disappears.",
            "It's a precocious performance, although one with melodramatic moments that prevent Lapica from entirely dispelling the specter of vanity self-casting.",
            "Lapica's debut impresses with its strong, clear voice and desire to tell a very personal story not just of substance abuse but of that abuse's painful root cause.",
            "Even when it is inelegant, Self-Medicated is a compelling small-scale drama, and Lapica is a talent to watch.",
            "This is a movie with a disturbing story to tell, but it promises more for the future of its first-time director, writer and star, Monty Lapica, than it really delivers for a viewer. The picture over-punches its message and ultimately grows tiresome.",

            "Suffers from one serious flaw, the otherwise talented director's choice of himself to star in the picture. Now 24, he's simply a little long in the tooth to try to pass for a teenager."

            "Not even Bu\u00f1uel with a brainful of Woodstock's bad brown acid could have made something this gloriously screwy.",
            "Alejandro Jodorowsky's Holy Mountain is a dazzling, rambling, often incoherent satire on consumerism, militarism and exploitation.",
            "This is an extraordinary visual concoction, loaded with stunning primary colors, anti-religious caricatures drawn from Diego Rivera and a succession of dreamlike, grotesque vistas worthy of Dal\u00ed at his most deranged.",
            "Jodorowsky loves to confront the viewer with endless brutality and grotesque decadence and degradation, but here he expresses it with a rich, densely visual imagination.",
            "Neither for the faint of heart or the linear of thinker, The Holy Mountain qualifies both as a fascinating period relic and an enduringly transfixing jaw-dropper.",
            "What The Holy Mountain depicts, rather than a narrative, is a series of tests and learning experiences that the fool will go through in order to attain enlightenment.",
            "An acid trip through the poison-tipped nettles of Jodorowsky's subconscious.",
            "A rambling stream-of-consciousness quest that - in its final, self-conscious act - celebrates the primacy of the filmed image.",
            "starts off with great promise but quickly descends into a kind of monotonous spiral of escalating pretension and wearisome shock tactics",
            "So loaded with symbols and religious references that the frames of the films flash by as if Jodorowsky were shuffling a deck of his beloved tarot cards...",
            "The Old and New Testament scrambled as a most sustained 'shroom hallucination, one sight at a time out of Alejandro Jodorowsky's bottomless tank",
            "Jodorowsky's 1973 surreal fantasy is just too much to dig through.",
            "a kaleidoscope of vibrant colours, free-floating archetypes and picaresque episodes, all packaged to disorient and confound us with its sheer exuberance, before finally bringing us right back to exactly who we are and what it is that we are seeing.",
            "Not the unsubtle 'what' he is saying in 'The Holy Mountain,' but the individualized 'how,' is filmmaker Jodorowsky's strength.",
            "Despite all its fanciful Bu\u00f1uelesque surrealism and echoes of Tod Browning's Freaks, it's not that far removed from the pop-culture movies that surround it.",
            "So extreme in its sacrilege that it achieves a kind of sacredness, The Holy Mountain is a transcendental feast of the grotesque and the sublime.",
            "Halfway through we're introduced to nine industrialists and politicians -- they narrate their heinous biographies in Godardian voiceover -- who embark up the title mountain to become immortal. Dude.",
            "Jodorowsky's greatest and most ambitious midnight movie, a wickedly outrageous masterpiece that towers over its better-known precursor El Topo... an ingeniously overstimulated film that could never be replicated today.",
            "The mise-en-scene is packed with colorful, often shocking images (blood and body wastes are recurring motifs) but orchestrated in a creative delirium.",
            "It's slightly tedious going, but you certainly get plenty to look at, what with costumed frogs and lizards re-enacting the conquest of Mexico.",
            "Jodorowsky appears to have satirical targets in his sights, but when the viewer is caught up in this barrage of images often playful, occasionally horrible, frequently beautiful, but always fascinating, it's hard to discern a coherent point.",
            "The icons, indirect references, and allusions - some obvious, most are ambiguous - occur with meticulous frequency. For the matter, even the most incidental detail or prop relays a history of meaning.",
            "More overtly religious and New Agey than Jodorowsky's other pictures, it describes a spiritual quest and slings in outrageous shocks at every opportunity, yielding many eyefuls and some occasional food for thought."

            "It's a big, cool, dopey, noisy, non-stop action powerhouse. It's also too long by a half hour and it left my ears ringing, but it's a lot of fun.",

            "hat was delivered will no doubt send merchandising sales spiralling into orbit, but sadly at the cost of countless brain cells popping through after nearly two and a half hours of tedium.",
            "Transformers delivers on its promise of stunning visuals and well-crafted action sequences, but it's not remotely worth the slog it takes to get there. Once the novelty of the robots wears off it's hopelessly insipid.",

            "irector Jim Brown tells the story well even if he refuses to address any of the singer's missteps (such as becoming infuriated when Dylan first plugged in at the Newport Folk Festival).",
            "A stirring, revelatory film, which captures Seeger as the media-age Johnny Appleseed of folk.",
            "Fans like Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan express unvarnished awe, but it's the well-told arc of Seeger's life that makes the strongest impression, as director Jim Brown takes us from the highs to the lows and back up again.",
            "As the loving documentary, Pete Seeger: The Power of Song, makes clear, Pete Seeger is still busy, still angry, still hopeful, still singing.",
            "Pete Seeger: The Power of Song could have been called Pete Seeger: The First Punk. As the film traces the singer's long life, it also, inevitably, tracks the evolution of American countercultures through much of the 20th century.",
            "Shallow, very officially sanctioned, and overly compressed.",
            "Joan Baez calls Pete a \"saint,\" and Jim Brown's documentary makes a strong case for his canonization.",
            "A love letter to the singer.",
            "Forget the controversial politics (that's what folk music is all about), this is a fascinating story with great music, despite the tedious last 15 minutes.",
            "An amazing man and an amazing film.",
            "You sense that Seeger may feel his greatest legacy is not what he accomplished, but what his presence gave others the courage to accomplish. Even if it was just singing along with a roomful of strangers.",
            "Director Brown has made a career of chronicling the history of American folk music, and Pete Seeger: The Power of Song is a worthy companion piece to his 1982 debut, The Weavers: Wasn't That a Time?",
            "More than an appreciation, Pete Seeger: The Power of Song is an inspiration.",
            "The Power of Song shows this icon of 20th-century music to be a man of passion and principle, and a true American. An important figure, an important film.",
            "[Seeger] traversed decades, styles, even continents to bring the people's music to the people. This distinction is made with suitable and skillful great appreciation by director Jim Brown in Pete Seeger: The Power of Song.",
            "A full and fond documentary.",
            "If you've never heard of Pete Seeger or if you've known him all your life, see this film. Walking out, you might just be ready to put the world together.",
            "The filmmakers treat this aged curmudgeon almost too reverently, but it is hard not to be awed by this gentle, resolute soul because of the ideas he steadfastly and faithfully represented.",
            "I don't know if Pete Seeger believes in saints, but I believe he is one. He's the one in the front as they go marching in.",
            "As certain to get auds singing as the man himself, Pete Seeger: The Power of Song is a terrific, multilayered portrait of a singer whose legacy extends beyond music and into every major social action movement since the 1940s."

            "Occasionally works as a black comedy, but there's nothing real or true in it",

            "At the end you are just left admiring one of Slater's best ever performances.",

            "This experimental-style documentary invokes the waking dreams of David Lynch, Werner Herzog and Errol Morris. It's like a true-crime inquiry undertaken during a total eclipse.",

            "Zoo, with its idiosyncratic subject matter, may not be the easiest sell in the world, but anyone interested in provocative, challenging, and unexpected fare owes it to themselves to check it out.",
            "It's never explicit or sensational or tittering. And in that it's something of a golden example; political documentaries should be this careful and restrained.",
            "The film's techniques are implicit, not explicit, its soothing images of rural highways and nighttime solitude conveying the social blankness its subjects report.",
            "Zoo is a cool sensibility married to a hot topic, a poetic film about a forbidden, unsettling subject."

            "Few would deny that Pierrot Le Fou is [Godard's] most innovative, iconoclast, and subversive film to date.",
            "Of the Godardian '60s, this effervescent, self-mocking, effortlessly iconic masterpiece may be the filmmaker's quintessential work.",
            "As with many other Godard films, I didn't like Pierrot le Fou the first time I saw it, but it stuck with me, and months later, I couldn't wait to see it again. Now I believe it's a masterpiece.",
            "Pierrot is a self conscious mash up of every movie genre that Godard loves, of every movie he has made, of all the artistic references (music, painting, literature) that have influenced or affected him",
            "An idiosyncratic work by a filmmaker trotting out his obsessions of the moment and committing them to film without much regard for actual meaning.",
            "And then theres the color. As much as anything, \"Pierrot\" is a film about red and blue, as well as a little bit of yellow and green.",
            "Theirs is, in their own words, 'A story,' 'All mixed up,' and their self-construction mimics that of their true Creator, the ever-experimental auteur Jean-Luc Godard. [Blu-ray]",
            "This sparkling, anarchic 1965 thriller is vintage Godard.",
            "An eye-poppingly vivid exercise in genre-busting filmmaking. Here is one of the most persistently intriguing directors of the 1960s at his most watchable and entertaining.",
            "Godard and his great cinematographer, Raoul Coutard, translate the ideas into some of the most visually exuberant French cinema of the Sixties.",
            "Beautifully photographed, the film is something of a curiosity. It may be a little hard to fathom from time to time, but it never ceases to fascinate.",
            "At times infuriatingly indulgent but is also an intoxicating, wildly inventive picaresque fantasy."

            "1984 may have a certain negative meaning to Westerners ever since Orwell immortalized that futuristic dystopia. But for India's Sikhs, 1984 has a far more dreaded historical significance, and one oddly buried here deep within their collective memory.",
            "Writer-director Shonali Bose makes a sensational feature debut with this moving, powerful and suspenseful film.",
            "[Director Bose] has a genuine gift for atmosphere, making the many wordless scenes, in teeming streets and on crowded trains, the movie's best.",
            "The flat, pat talk is symptomatic of Amu's overriding problem: It has no sense of personal style.",
            "Amu, the ambitious debut feature by Shonali Bose, wears its political heart on its sleeve and is unafraid to tackle big topics: identity, history, truth, injustice.",
            "Too bad first-time writer-director Shonali Bose's juxtaposition of the personal and the political often feels forced, and like many didactic history lessons, this one's about 20 minutes too long.",
            "Deeply affecting tale of the slaughter of Sikhs in 1984.",
            "We wait a long time for the political points to become resonant as the movie slogs through aimless, dull, family chit-chat.",
            "[Director] Bose embeds her history lesson in a drama with authentic emotional mother-daughter conflict.",
            "At times, it wobbles too close to melodrama, but the performances are strong and the history upon which the story is based is so devastating that the film packs a wallop despite its faults.",
            "Good intentions do eventually trump mediocre drama and the climactic flashbacks of the riots, as Sikhs are torn out of homes and trains by murderous mobs, are the stuff of nightmares."

            "The finely crafted Alice Neel is at once tribute, investigative journalism and messy family drama.",
            "There is a great deal more to Alice's story: the avant-garde of the 1920s; the government's support of artists during the Great Depression; the feminist movement of the 1970s, during which she became an icon. This rich film captures it all.",
            "If the artist is an elusive target, the art is as sharp as a razor blade. The portraits are extraordinary.",
            "So many people speak onscreen, from so many folds of Neel's life, that, despite captions, the viewer feels taxed to keep straight their identities and relationships to Neel.",
            "For all the juicy storytelling, Alice Neel remains, in this film, a cipher: brash, grandmotherly, and beyond understanding.",
            "Directed with great feeling and in a nonjudgmental way.",
            "This documentary by the artist's grandson Andrew Neel, delves into the life and imagination of Alice Neel, the defiant pioneering, cutting edge, raunchy and prolific late artist.",
            "A decent warm-up to a more robust documentary that'll never be made.",
            "A surprisingly dense, multilayered documentary on the painter Alice Neel.",
            "Alice Neel offers a relatively objective view of a person who, seeing life as a sentence to be served, spent it doing the thing she loved.",
            "[It's] more than a mere biography of an important 20th-century artist: It's also an intimate portrait of a family member that questions whether or not 'great artist' and 'good parent' can ever be combined in the same person.",
            "The effect is spirited rather than incriminating and, bolstered by Jonah Rapino's contemplative score, as piercingly detailed as one of Alice's mesmerizing portraits.",
            "The fascinating documentary Alice Neel illuminates history while also demonstrating how an artist's style reveals his or her personality.",
            "Neel is a compelling subject, but she's more alive in one of her paintings than in all of the voluminous video footage her grandson thrusts upon us."

            "It is clearly one of 2007's family cinema highlights.",

            "The story is compelling enough that even glib phrases like 'healing through hip-hop' can't drag it down.",
            "Will the music of The Hip Hop Project album change your life? Likely, no. Did the process of making it change the lives of those involved in its creation? Undoubtedly. And that, perhaps, is inspiration enough.",
            "Net profits from the theatrical release of The Hip Hop Project will be donated to youth organizations, so you can feel doubly good about attending this modestly moving tribute to a small but significant kind of inner-city success.",
            "There is some inspired camera work during some of the performance sequences, but none of the performances themselves stick. It's a shame when a film about the power of music doesn't contain one memorable song.",
            "The live performances sizzle. Expect genuine passion behind the music, even when you wonder, as an MTV interviewer does during the film, whether these kids are that much more captivating than a million other hip-hop hopefuls.",
            "All of this is related in a well-meaning, would-be uplifting but ultimately ham-handed manner somewhere between a PBS documentary and a TV movie of the week.",
            "In fact, it is the tyro director's slapdash structure and pacing that distract from the film's content. A rather haphazard architect of his own material, Ruskin tends to rush certain crucial developments while lingering on more lackluster details.",
            "Its most compelling message is about the importance and power of community.",
            "Scenes that should be revelatory, such as a lyric-writing session, are sketchy and fail to give a sense of the work being done.",
            "Despite a jumpy narrative, the film works because Kazi speaks to the kids on their level but from a slight elevation, and the honesty and raw emotion he draws out of them come through."

            "When you see all of these octogenarians struggling through the snow and perilous ice to make it to their show, you really see what true courage and artistic commitment are all about.",
            "Charming documentary on the struggle to keep Yiddish theater alive against all odds, including assimilated Jews' shame at a language associated with victimhood.",
            "The film's candid personalities provide plenty of memorably off-the-cuff moments.",
            "Interviews with aging caretakers of the Yiddish Theater are vivid windows into a bygone world, and Spaisman herself, a feisty firebrand whose accent is so strong Katzir supplied subtitles, is a formidable personality.",

            "Nicola Sacco, Bartolomeo Vanzetti, and the incredible firestorm of outrage generated by their criminal trials have been largely neglected in recent years, but Peter Miller's absolutely engrossing documentary Sacco and Vanzetti brings it all back.",
            "The meat-and-potatoes style of Sacco and Vanzetti seems less a failure of imagination than a means of putting in the foreground its intriguing subject matter.",
            "Miller, a New Yorker, uses archival footage, dramatized readings and talking heads, including Sacco's niece and a neighbor of Vanzetti's, to get his point across.",
            "Miller's film shows how quickly Americans facing perceived foreign threats are willing to ignore basic liberties. Sound familiar?",
            "[Pic] does a superb job of condensing an overwhelming mass of documentation, archival imagery and artistic representation into a concise yet passionate history lesson whose relevance could not be timelier.",
            "Only 81 minutes long, Sacco and Vanzetti is packed with information.",
            "A long-held cause celebre for leftists the world over, the story of immigrant activists Sacco & Vanzetti is told in Peter Miller's rote documentary as a reference point for the way immigrants are still mistreated in America.",
            "Surprisingly, this is the first nonfiction film to tackle the subject and Miller manages to find the parallels to contemporary times without being too pedantic or heavy-handed.",
            "But even those who might feel that the movie presents a one-sided view of the evidence would have to admit that the trial was a travesty.",
            "A knee-jerk take that may touch many hearts but does not feed or satisfy the mind.",
            "With cases of such importance, it's always a good idea to be reminded every now and then as to how things can go wrong, and justice means that just because a person is guilty of SOMETHING, doesn't mean that it's okay for the State frame them for something",
            "Watching the film, it's hard not to feel a cold chill of recognition, particularly when Miller's interviewees discuss immigration, patriotism and war, and civil liberties versus homeland security in a time of national crisis.",
            "[Director Peter Miller] shrewdly exposes the monolithic, class-driven legal machinery that sent a pair of innocent, hard-working immigrants to the chair.",
            "An excellent, disturbing documentary.",
            "An informative expose' for those na\u00efve enough not to know that the criminal justice system has always been stacked in favor of the rich, the white, and the well-connected.",
            "The measured tone, though understatedly indignant regarding the miscarriage of justice, will likely draw viewers into the conversation.",
            "rather too glib",
            "A bit pedantic, but thorough and interesting throughout, a must for history buffs."

            "Godard's acute examination of the political climate of the period.",

            "It's never enough to establish any sensitivity or social pertinence beyond the trifling tiffs which are playing out on screen.",
            "There's only so much twentysomething navel-gazing one can listen to before wanting to slap some sense - and some fully formed sentences - into them all.",
            "There is something teeth-grindingly cutesy about the whole thing, reaching epic levels of dippiness in the, ahem, nude trumpet-playing scenes. That makes it sound interesting, come to think of it, and perhaps it is.",
            "Hannah Takes the Stairs, the latest comedy of mannerisms in the \"mumblecore\" style, is maddening for 60 of its 83 minutes.",
            "The film meanders along in conversational style, encouraging improvisational realism but also the thought that maybe these middle-class characters, not quite slackers, are less interesting than they, or the director, think they are.",
            "Joe Swanberg's film wears out its welcome about halfway through its 83 minutes.",
            "Smart and engaging, but too many meandering breeze-shooting sequences.",
            "Less dazed and confused than mumbling and mundane, this drama focuses on social awkwardness and twentysomething blues. Skipping aimlessly from scene to scene it offers little observations and rewards low expectations.",
            "For every revelatory moment of sharp perception there's an eternity of goofy smiles, stuttered dialogue and embarrassed glances.",
            "Watchable independent drama from the mumblecore crowd, though it's not quite sharp enough, funny enough or insightful enough to really get off the ground and the characters are occasionally irritating.",
            "Goes full blast on geek chatter.",
            "Swanberg can be playful behind the camera -- he has a taste for Godardian jump cuts -- and his sense of color is crisp. Gerwig, his millennial Jean Seberg, is no pixie; her captivating ordinariness helps hold the movie together.",
            "[Director] Swanberg nails the inane fun of youth.",
            "No one involved seems to have any thoughts about why people are selfish and cruel to each other, but they're more than willing to complain about it.",
            "Chop off a star if you're not up for highly experimental cinema.",
            "When it works, it works like a charm.",
            "Perfectly encapsulates the slow-motion, frustrated feeling of early adulthood, when longing and inchoate desire easily outnumber actual transformative events and achievements.",
            "Performances help raise Hannah Takes the Stairs above the realm of self-indulgent cinema to something worth seeing.",
            "Gerwig is a modest (like everything in Mumblecore) revelation in the role, with a lithe, teasing sexuality and a vibrant personality that seems to be darting off in as many directions as her tousled blonde hair.",
            "Looks like it should be on an Off Off Off Broadway play in the Village...",
            "Gerwig proves herself to be a charming screen presence who manages to make her character somehow appealing despite her utter self-involvement.",
            "Hannah is charmingly self-absorbed without the extenuating circumstance of self-knowledge. Above all, she's young. The movie forgives her for that and, with occasional misgivings, so do we."

            "Dreaming Lhasa is a fine example of how feature films can be used to deliver urgent political messages, but its dramatic elements waver.",
            "The adverts promise a voyage to Tibet like we've never seen, but Ritu Sarin and Tenzing Sonam's vision of people unmoored from their homeland is a familiar and banal embossment of foreign anguish.",
            "This surprisingly-engaging, semi-autobiographical docudrama must have served as sojourn of self-discovery for the moviemaker, though it now offers his audience a refreshingly realistic peek into the plight of a displaced people.",
            "Stilted acting and dialogue, but Tibet has hardly a film industry: we should be glad this picture about identity crisis has come our way.",
            "While the film argues that nationalism isn't confined by borders, it also proves that neither are bad performances."

            "Clever, certainly; ingenious, occasionally; enjoyable - hardly ever.",
            "Purveys huge charm, enough to make you fall in love with the rat species and enough, with its array of screen dishes, to make America forgive France, re-dub freedom fries as French fries, and fall sobbing on the country's cordon bleu shoulders.",
            "Director Brad Bird has created a Pixar movie that's a joy to behold.",
            "I loved Ratatouille. I was even tempted to drop the odd bit of popcorn, like tipping the waiter after a particularly good meal.",
            "Despite the unexplained language barriers or farfetched plot, this delightfully delicious foray into the unimaginable never becomes preachy or immature.",
            "This is a film about a rat who becomes a chef in Paris. But it's so much more than that. It's about what a great artist can be, where a great artist can come from, it's about food and how to savour it.",
            "A love letter to Paris, a valentine to the fine art of cooking, and a gift to film fans of all ages.",
            "A delectable treat that represents the finest qualities in animation and American cinema.",
            "Has great vocal performances throughout and is about a character figuring out where they belong and finally being accepted there. I love it!",
            "That is the (...) imperative message of Ratatouille. Everyone is not an artist, but anyone could be an artist. Because, as living creatures, it is simply what we do.",
            "The studio's latest effort offers beautiful and strikingly realistic animation, but the flawed concept should have been scrapped...",
            "I won't spoil the broth, but suffice to say Ratatouille is a bursting with bright flavors, some spice, and deep warmth that settles in your belly and satisfies body and soul.",
            "There is so much to enjoy and celebrate here, Ratatouille deserves more than a review: it could (and probably will) inspire books about creativity and good taste. ",
            "Ratatouille was written and directed by Brad Bird, the guy behind The Incredibles, and while his new movie isn't as brainy as that one, it has lots of lovely touches to appeal to parents as well as kids.",
            "Ratatouille is a triumph that not only pays tribute to the spirit of discovery, but revels in the fun of making a few of its own.",
            "And there's Remy himself, voiced by irreverent comic Patton Oswalt. Yes, he's a rat, and a pantless one at that, but he's a charming rat.",
            "The latest from Pixar and Oscar winning writer-director Brad Bird is a fabulously enjoyable parable about the pursuit of excellence and rising above the preconceptions of others.",

            "It's not my favourite Pixar film.",
            "No restaurant has ever benefited from placing rats in a recipe, but the digital wizards in Pixar's kitchen have cooked up a winning peasant dish in Ratatouille."

            "For my money, [the] first 20 or so minutes are the best in the film. Once the real adventure gets underway in the cave, things get less interesting.",
            "While the movie has wonderful moments of unmotivated tension that make sure we're quite ill at ease from the beginning, it's also got a few too many of the kind of cheap boo-scares that indicate a director not fully trusting his grip on you.",
            "The Descent is a phenomenal movie anyway, its women so brave, so dedicated to one another, so mistrusting or untrustworthy; its caves alternate between terrifying and beautiful...",
            "This punishing British-produced thriller knows how to do the fright thing without making any of the wrong moves we associate with standard-format hack-'em-ups.",
            "RECOMMENDED \"Deliverance\" with alpha-female spelunkers instead of macho men, set in caverns rather than on an endangered river, Neil Marshall's intense, bloody, emotionally viscid [movie] is a neatly elegant bite of malicious terror.",
            "The movie unfolds in a satisfying slow-burn that makes you feel uneasy until it takes that anxiety and turns it into pure nightmare fuel by making your worst fears real.",
            "The best horror film since The Blair Witch Project.",
            "A smart, fresh and exhilarating genre movie. ",
            "An all-female cast, a claustrophobic cave setting draped in red light, and an anarchic, vicious fight to the death...need I say more about one of the most physically taxing movies of the century?",
            "The Descent is already unusual for being a horror movie with an all-female cast, but it's even more unique for being the kind of movie that explores the damage caused by a friend's betrayal.",
            "Here is a movie so precise and cautious with its material that every moment, every suggestion or action, becomes an experience that involves us to alarming lengths.",
            "Super-scary and vicious, both psychologically and physically, this cleverly produced chill-ride is edgy British horror at its very best.",
            "Tense, gory and masterfully malevolent.",
            "Although Neil Marshall's attempt to justify the U.S. ending is admirable, the original ending is the only way out - providing a chilling bookend to a motif and suggesting what seems like cerulean-tinged peace is actually the solitary solace of madness.",
            "Director Marshall has obviously kept his DVD player spinning for days studying all of the classics and simply taking everything he needed like a Vanilla Ice \"Under Pressure\"",
            "Blank screamers, fastidiously amplified \"boos,\" and the most confused intimations of lesbianism since High Tension",

            "It's easy to understand why this was Herzog's final collaboration with the actor, but Kinski's performance nevertheless serves up a potent confusion of documentary and fiction that has long been an essential element of Herzog's filmmaking.",
            "Though less apocalyptical than usual, the imagery is as lavish as ever, but the film is wrecked by an underwritten narrative.",

            "Linear storytelling was never Herzog's strong suit even under the best of conditions. His strength lies in capturing lucid lunacy on film, and Manoel da Silva's descent into the jaws of madness is a straight shot into the heart of darkness.",

            "The most heartbreaking, moving film in theaters right now is not Babel, Letters From Iwo Jima or Little Children. It is China Blue, a documentary about sweatshop workers at a denim factory.",

            "in the same category as Riis' \"How the Other Half Lives\" and other scathing exposes from America's own less than noble economic past. Patently angry, but never strident, this film is as intelligent as it is jarring",
            "Just the latest in an invaluable string of eye-opening documentaries designed to make Westerners face the fact that their relatively high standard of living comes at the expense of impoverished, indigenous peoples of the Third World.",
            "A must-see--if not by the average consumer, then by politicians and U.N. officials.",
            "The film does not benefit from the great power of contrast that was central to the superior Mardi Gras: Made in China, but it's crucial for its very methodical study of life inside a sweatshop.",
            "It's a sobering assessment, rescued from being entirely depressing by the sunny, matter-of-fact disposition of Jasmine and her mates.",
            "Pic's degree of access and intimacy is surprising, even more so when closing intertitles reveal Chinese authorities did try to shut down the filmmakers several times."

            "This movie is fun and at times a bit goofy but still an energetic action period movie. It was definitely worth going to go see.",
            "Kingdom is a decent action adventure that just takes a while to really get going. The performances aren't totally satisfying and the story isn't exactly hard to follow, but it does feel like it's trying to be more convoluted than it needs to be. ",
            "There's just so much palpable fun and excitement dripping from every scene. Kingdom's live-action film is so well done there will most likely be a huge new wave of audiences seeking out Yasuhisa Hara's original work.",
            "... given the chance, [audiences will] discover that Kingdom is an exciting action/drama filled with intrigue, treachery, daring fight sequences, and incredible heart.",

            "Kingdom is effectively a comic book movie, with all the pomp and bombast we have come to expect. Showcasing a dash of Hong Kong gongfu moves and realistic swordplay, it is a fun adventure boasting tight action and engaging set pieces.",
            "Bad. Ass. ",
            "Expect battlefield elegance and theatrical attack modes...an augmented history lesson that's hip and gets away with it.",
            "It's incredibly good fun and the young cast more than hold their own.",
            "The bigger problem is that the film is let down by an overwrought script from writer-director Shinsuke Sato.",
            "Kingdom clips along while delivering intricately and imaginatively choreographed action scenes that are fun to watch if not especially deep."

            "Excellent performances by a good cast and a fairly authentic look at working-class struggles go only so far in Brian Jun's Steel City, which paints an industrial Minnesota municipality entirely in tones of gray and blue.",
            "[Director Jun pounds] out a suitably gritty atmosphere, and there's real chemistry between Ferrera and the excellent, quietly expressive Guiry. He's an actor still looking for his big break; this is a fine time to discover him before everyone else does.",

            "This is a surreal and exhausting experience.",
            "Marion Cotillard tears up all the available scenery in this overblown, achronological biopic of French pop singer Edith Piaf.",
            "La Vie is a movie so frantic to get to it all that nothing is more than touched on.",
            "This kind of heightened drama might not work in most movies, but it suits its larger-than-life subject: Dahan's La Vie is the movie equivalent of a torch song.",
            "Compelling but punishing -- an artful ordeal. The best way to process it may be as unintended camp, rolling your eyes in amazement at its litany of misery and heaps of histrionics.",
            "Long for all but the true fan, containing the obligatory musical stations-of-the-cross, this film isn't Ray, but it isn't bad.",
            "A thoroughly gruelling, yet highly engrossing biopic of the legendary French singer Edith Piaf.",
            "Despite its story of suffering that comes in unceasing waves, La Vie en Rose may be the most hopeful film yet made about the grueling rigor of living.",
            "In La Vie En Rose,we get to witness a rare and beautiful thing - an artist baring her soul and creating a performance for the ages.",
            "Even if you're like me and find most musical biopics depressingly formulaic, you might think Oliver Dahan's Edith Piaf movie is a slight cut above.",
            "The French, as is widely known, adore suffering. That's why they love Leonard Cohen, Bud Powell, and Jim Thompson.",
            "No regrets for Cottilard's dedication, but plenty for the clich\u00e9d pap of the biopic genre",
            "In La Vie en Rose, Marion Cotillard has the role of a lifetime. And she relishes it.",
            "Quite simply, is the best movie I have seen all year.",
            "Marion Cotillard's Oscar win? Totally justified...Many questions remain for those of us unschooled in Piaf lore. I was confused by some of the causes even as I felt the emotional effects, thanks to deep performances.",
            "Much like the colorful life of the film's subject, La Vie en Rose explores the strange and emotional life of torch singer Edith Piaf and gives Marion Cotillard an Oscar for her tremendous performance.",
            "Cotillard joins Ben Kingsley (Gandhi) and Forest Whitaker (The Last King of Scotland) in so completely embodying a role that it seems more possession than performance.",

            "At just over an hour, it seems better suited for TV viewing than a theatrical release.",

            "Utterly conventional...but still works as an uplifting tale of success in adverse circumstances, and as a testimony to the power of one dedicated teacher.",
            "The film is really geared toward basketball fans who won't mind the talking-heads format, and the glowing interviews that have more the tone of testimonials than a historical documentary.",
            "It muddies key details (it's not clear we're seeing the '55 championship game until it's over), while never addressing others (the team's gifted coach quit in '57, but who knows why?).",
            "Understands sport as much more than athletics, when basketball served not as a source of endorsement deals but as an opportunity for people who never had much before.",
            "Betsy Blankenbaker's film doesn't possess the kinetic charge of the tale itself; it's too reliant on talking heads and faded photos. In short, Cheer feels amateurish for a generation raised on sports films.",
            "A reverential yet frustratingly skimpy nonfiction record.",
            "Writer-director Blankenbaker fails to get much out of her subjects beyond surface generalities. It's a shame, because you know these men have stories to share.",

            "Zodiac is not just a masterclass in film-making and storytelling, it's proof that a horror movie does not have to be showy to be scary.",
            "The first half of the movie plays like a police procedural... It's a thrilling whirlwind of facts and dead ends and terrifying attacks that increasingly adds to the sense of helplessness with the case.",

            "Cal Tech basketball team's story is subject of Rick Greenwald's captivatingly quirky Quantum Hoops, a film that's as smart as its subjects--the team of smart players who continue to push their game although they consistently lose.",

            "Quantum Hoops -- the debut documentary from Rick Greenwald -- is an absolute slam-dunk.",
            "Although Greenwald has made a fairly lighthearted film, replete with playful graphics and humorous digressions, it does prompt some serious reflection on what college sports are really all about.",
            "The Caltech Beavers are a surprisingly charming group of overachievers who prove to have as much heart on the court as they do brains in the classroom."

            "Fond, stinging, and finally instructive, the film assembles a comprehensive look back at the actions, arrest, and prosecution of a group of political malcontents (most of them young Catholics and some of them priests) in the summer of 1971.",
            "While no one will mistake director Anthony Giacchino for Michael Moore, the documentarian unfolds the drama of the arrest and eventual not guilty verdict of 28 Vietnam War protesters in 1971.",

            "The anthology format would fit better on TV, as would director Richard E. Robbins' unfortunate use of cheesy slo-mo re-enactments. When Robbins flickers through a series of photos of the fallen, the rapid cutting becomes absurd and dehumanizing.",

            "Robbins' docu, initiated by the NEA, tries to convey the subjective feeling and thoughts of soldiers through their writing, be they letters, poems, or stories. By necessity, this collection, which is read by pro actors, is varied in interest and quality.",
            "A different approach from more straightforward Iraq War documentaries. And the film definitely has effective moments, especially those dealing with grief and the rough transition from military to civilian life.",
            "They're stories of war that resonate with anyone who has ever been in a war zone, and they illustrate beautifully for those who have not seen battle, just what combat can do to a person's soul.",

            "With a charming quality, 'Antonia' avoids the triteness of many music films that touch on triumph, heartbreak, decline, and then a new, determined start.",
            "A euphoric celebration of the rough road to womanhood and at the same time a biting critique of machista culture, Antonia is a brave, inspired antidote to current misogynistic Brazilian film fare.",

            "De Felitta's portrait of Paris -- who died in June 2004 -- isn't always flattering, but it is genuinely moving on many levels, none of which require knowledge of or even interest in jazz.",
            "Like the maker of the similar documentary Stone Reader, De Felitta is determined to restore Paris' work to public view. Based on the many delightful samples on the soundtrack, it's an exemplary goal.",

            "A modestly mounted, but curiously poignant little documentary which somehow -- quietly, devastatingly -- shows and tells you more than you may perhaps want to know about the dehumanization implicit in the mighty, blighted Iraqi adventure.",
            "The American military comes across as bungling and ineffective as protectors. If people thought we didn't know what we were doing in Iraq before, this is yet more evidence of our incompetence.",

            "Turns out that every country, every civilization, has its good eggs as well as its bad ones. What The Prisoner clearly shows us is that this Administration has no interest in learning the difference between the two.",
            "The banality and muted despair of this endured horror is laced with the all too chilling familiarity of racist US revenge culture, like police brutality, exported to an imperialist conquest war zone and spreading like a planetary social contagion.",
            "What's troubling about the film's technique is its lack of context; we must take Yuris, who speaks serviceable English, pretty much at his word. What's troubling about his story is its ring of truth.",
            "The Prisoner is a triumph of specificity. It is one man's story, told in scrupulous and vivid detail.",
            "None of The Prisoner's showy flourishes -- animation, sound effects, fancy editing -- can match the power of Abbas' stillness as he describes one man's agony in one huge hell.",
            "Retroish cartoon panels of Uday Hussein and torture cell blocks, thought balloons floating over live talking heads, amplified sound effects. The choice is a bold one, occasionally glib and almost derailing the seriousness of the material.",
            "Consider it the single gloomiest cocktail-party story of all time.",
            "Provides ample proof of the old adage that truth is stranger than fiction.",

            "A follow-up to the acclaimed Gunner Place, this docu, about one innocent Iraqui's detention and then shipment to Abu Ghraib, exhibits a restrained approach that allows its righteous indignation to grow slowly without resorting to manipulative tactics.",
            "What really gives you hope for humanity in general is that Abbas came out of his demeaning and heart-rending experience with his dignity and, maybe, some of his sense of humor intact.",
            "Modest picture offers a miniature portrait of the military occupation at its most sinister and comically inept, and the mild-mannered Abbas himself makes a wry, fatalistic protagonist.",
            "The Prisoner or: How I Planned to Kill Tony Blair, a documentary with a tiny cast of characters and a modest budget, is a microscopic view of a big and ugly war."

            "Paced like a drama, imbued with a spellbinding intimacy, and impressionistic in its visual portrayal of crime and punishment, it follows the 2002 murder of Francois Chenu, a gay man beaten by Nazi skinheads and left to drown in a nearby pond in Reims.",
            "Thankfully, Meyrou's intent isn't to launch a predictable crusade against homophobia itself, but to quietly understand the factors that molded this young trio into senseless killers.",
            "It's unlikely to appeal to your mainstream moviegoer, but this French documentary achieves remarkable things with a depressing subject.",

            "a contemplative, almost poetic examination of the proper workings of justice, and an exemplary depiction of a ruined family rebuilt on the foundations of its own humanistic values.",
            "Olivier Meyrou may keep his distance from his subjects, but staying out of their way doesn't mean losing sight of their troubles.",
            "While the documentary is well intended, that of parents' willingness to forgive three punks for murdering their son, the direction is uncreative and dull.",
            "Meyrou's suitably sombre film leaves you with a sense of enormous respect for a couple refusing to be consumed by hatred, prepared instead to offer their forgiveness.",
            "This deeply moving account of a French family's response to a needless tragedy is all the more effective as it eschews the sensationalism of so much modern reportage.",
            "The settings are mundane, but the exchanges are emotionally raw and so neatly convey both the drama and the grinding daily routine of having to cope with tragedy.",

            "Filmmaker Robert Stone doesn't have the answer, but his curiosity about Oswald and the entire assassination experience has been shaped into this fascinating documentary.",
            "Veteran conspiracy buffs probably won't find much of Stone's material particularly new, but Stone's film does serve as a neat summary for the rest of us while offering a number of intriguing insights into how conspiracy theories work...",
            "Though the film may not change many minds about what happened and why, at least it attempts to describe and explain events like few other documentaries on the same topic.",
            "Although [the director] often shifts abruptly from micro to macro, the film holds together, and a two-pronged thesis gradually emerges.",
            "The selling point of Oswald's Ghost, Robert Stone's documentary about the enigmatic blue collar Texan generally regarded as the assassin of President John F. Kennedy, is its refusal to dispute the safest assumption.",
            "The title of this nonfiction examination into JFK's assassination implies that its focus is the legacy of Lee Harvey Oswald and his infamous crime, but the truth is far more mundane.",
            "After a strong start, Oswald's Ghost ends up as ephemeral as its namesake.",
            "This is a good refresher course for those who aren't familiar with the JFK assassination. But despite the film's attempts to close the case, there will always be questions about what happened on that November day in Dallas."

            "The focus of Obscene remains steadfastly on the man, thanks to a rich variety of archival and interview clips that span his entire career and a slew of colleagues, fiends and enemies.",
            "Though Obscene tells the story without fully exploring its nuances, that story is both fascinating and more than a little inspiring.",

            "While the filmmakers squander some excellent opportunities that might have helped to illuminate the contradictions in their subject, this remains a fascinating study of an unrepentant American maverick.",
            "Brilliant social history about one of the greatest publishers of the modern epoch, even if he is \"Human, All Too Human\"",
            "With testimony from scads of heyday contributors and an infectious design reflecting Grove Press's innovative cover art ... the filmmakers could have shelved the weaker bits without missing a beat.",

            "... a justified tribute to [Barney] Rosset, who in his mid-80s is still feisty, with a refreshingly lighthearted attitude toward all he accomplished.",

            "Nothing terribly original happens in this remake of a 1957 semi-classic that starred Glenn Ford and Van Heflin, but everything happens smoothly and with grace.",
            "The film is a creditable remake - no better than the original but different enough to stand on its considerable merits.",
            "Mangold's film is more than sufficiently subtexty and cynical for our modern sensibilities while simultaneously embracing Mangold's obvious pleasure in the Westerns' time-honored swinging saloon doors and stern masculine traditions.",
            "Mangold delivers a taut modern take on a lesser classic, preserving the High Noon themes about doing the right thing against all odds, and injecting a more modern pacing and urgency without going overboard.",
            "A well-made movie that isn't as simply expressed as its predecessor and so loses some of its mythic quality; the more you complicate westerns the less effective they often become.",
            "A shame that it ends on this one false note, but up to that point 3.10 To Yuma fairly races along.",
            "The basic plot - Old West environment or not - is an amusing choice to reintroduce to audiences, since most viewers will be unfamiliar with the 1957 adaptation.",
            "2007 may very well be the year when the Western comes riding back into town.",
            "3:10 to Yuma is not only exciting, well-acted, and engaging, but it also reveals a deep sense of spirituality; of right and wrong. ",
            "A solid, gritty drama getting the most out of its starpower.",
            "Take(s) a tried-and-true genre and make[s] it rousing and fresh.",
            "With its great acting, great pacing, and crackerjack storyline, Yuma is not only fun, it is surprisingly moral.",
            "Both dull and deeply unnecessary; a stinker.",
            "3:10 to Yuma, director James Mangold's new duster features the toothsome duo, plus a bevy of time-tested conventions -- a white hat, a black hat, a good little woman, couple of towheaded kids, and a few unlikely twists to boot. Oh, yes, it has boots, too.",
            "3:10 to Yuma isn't a necessary film. But it sure is tasty.",
            "Elevated above the usual fare by an engaging and complex relationship between its two stars, 3:10 To Yuma would be a thoroughly entertaining two hours whatever the genre - the Western setting is almost a bonus. ",
            "The real thrill of the film lies in watching these two men, sat on various sides of the moral fence, gradually converge and respect each other.",
            "3:10 to Yuma is as heavy on character as it sounds like it should be ... and still a rip-roaring adventure around it; until it all gets away from director James Mangold in a crashing heap of unlikely motivation and flawed decisions.",
            "Director James Mangold amps up the blood and thunder without sacrificing the moral complexity of Elmore Leonard's original short story.",
            "3:10 to Yuma confirms that the western is alive and kicking with a vengeance.",
            "It is part of the richness of 3.10 to Yuma that this is a classical piece of storytelling with themes and characters that can be found in the very earliest Westerns.",
            "Bale and Crowe are superlative, but Mangold's rote, banal expansion never quickens the pulse.",
            "Mangold's direction is effective, if unobtrusive, and the dusty deserts of the American west continue to provide a cinematic palette that fails to run dry.",

            "It's an exciting, well-directed thriller that, while providing more than enough action and gore to satisfy genre fans, also offers the political commentary that has characterized zombie movies.",
            "There isn't much acting here, but there is entirely too much vomiting, and the prose turns laughably purple, too.",
            "Even though I knew the scares were coming, I jumped out of my seat a few times.",
            "As eerie as the first and probably more scary.",
            "Combines traditional B-movie virtues -- economy, invention, sinewy narrative spine -- with the eerily resonant spectacle of a 21st-century metropolis stripped of its citizenry.",
            "Under Fresnadillo's assured direction, 28 Weeks Later blurs the line between genre entertainment and a photojournalist's shots of the next urban catastrophe.",
            "This sequel, directed by the much more imaginative Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (Intacto, Intruders), takes the zombie invasion in a new, grim direction.",
            "Are you starting to see that the allegorical nature of the zombie movie has made an impressive come-back in 28 Weeks Later? Bless its heart, Fresnadillo's film is best enjoyed-by me, at least-as an indictment of the American quagmire in Iraq.",
            "It's films like this that underline why zombie movies have such staying power.",
            "Intelligently executed, having the integrity to be about the story rather than the cheap thrills.",
            "I like smart storytelling, and this was really interesting...fresh and realistic.",
            "Calling it an unadulterated exercise in nihilism might be an understatement.",
            "While 28 Days Later is undeniably violent and bloody, the sequel revels in pouring on extra gore. ",
            "A damn worthy follow-up to an unexpectedly excellent chiller.",
            "Isn't the same thinking man's zombie film as its predecessor, but it ramps up the action and will leave you on edge enough that you'll be searching for a nightlight before going to sleep.",
            "With its expertly paced thrills, unrelenting terror and apocalyptic despair, 28 Weeks Later ain't a bad roller coaster to ride.",
            "Apocalyptic zombie sequel isn't for the squeamish.",
            "deft and stylish",
            "28 Weeks Later contains many elements from the first film while also packing a much stronger emotional punch and ferocious intensity. ",
            "Explicitly envisions Britain as a deserted combat zone",
            "A worthy sequel that is recommended - even if you're tired of zombie flicks!"

            "Slowly, you suffer the creeping realization that nothing is going to happen. Nothing.",
            "for the rest of us who think that a piece of cinema should be more than that, Lions for Lambs leaves us feeling empty rather than sparked by the zeitgeist the film attempts to capture.",
            "The absence of activists in the streets protesting the war in Iraq continues to confound; the empty seats at theaters showing Lions for Lambs will be somewhat easier to explain.",
            "Lions for Lambs reminds us of what Hollywood does best, when it wants to.",
            "It attempts to conquer social, political and military all in the same film, but it doesn't knock any of them out of the park.",

            "Such are the actual subtleties of Mortensen's performance - the odd sardonic smile; the slight tightening of a look - you're aware, from the off, that what he is on the outside might not have anything to do with what he is on the inside. ",
            "Eastern Promises is a fascinating case of a film made under the intense gaze of a supreme auteur and written by the separate but equally potent hand of a writer. ",
            "Knight throws in a twist that scrambles the movie's moral compass so late in the game, so perfunctorily and so pointlessly, as to render any final reckoning incoherent.",
            "Quite possibly the best film of the year, it is to be seen at all costs.",
            "David Cronenberg's spin on \"The Departed,\" in which lawmen and the lawless were similarly tested within an ethnic mafia's ranks. But where that became an overwrought bloodbath, \"Promises\" maintained a vicious focus on mob malevolence and personal peril.",
            "\"It starts very well, and we're immediately drawn into this world of dead pregnant teens, the Russian mob, the hermeneutics of tattoos and the archetypal disappointment of a father with his son.\"",
            "A captivating and intimidating presence, Mortenson is simply striking in his consecutive Cronenberg film, playing the slick Russian mob figure who suffers from a crisis of conscience with equal parts calm and intensity.",
            "Clearly a companion piece to (and just as good as, if not better than) 2005's fantastic A History of Violence, Eastern Promises is all about blood, in the familial as well as the literal sense.",
            "Even if the frequently low-key plot suffers from the occasional sleepy stretch, Mortensen turns in a magnificent performance.",
            "Late-period Cronenberg masterpiece",
            "David Cronenberg is a director who sets out to bring life (and death) back to violence. In Eastern Promises he does just that. It is a movie that will make audiences squirm and look away.",
            "Mortensen is very convincing as Nikolai, and his Russian accent is impeccable.",
            "Un ejemplo de cine negro contempor\u00e1neo realizado y narrado con gran precisi\u00f3n. Excelente elenco donde se destaca la notable labor de Viggo Mortensen.",
            "Eastern Promises has a lot going for it, which makes it all the more disappointing when the story takes a fatal turn towards the end."

            "An intriguing blend of mainstream audience-pleaser and a more subtle, even intellectual agenda.",
            "It's not surprising, but it's engaging enough that most patrons will likely cut the director some slack for the out-of-period details and convoluted plot contrivances that make the film seem at once sloppy and too neat.",
            "The drama gains momentum in the second half, so the film gets better, but it's never too far from cliche.",
            "[Gray's] feel for dialogue has rarely failed him, and it doesn't here.",
            "A sombre, intelligent, feeling crime drama set in a working-class New York characterised by striving and shabbiness.",
            "The stand-out set piece is an agonising car chase in the rain, replacing the full-throttle showmanship of the Bourne series with a foot on the brake, a shotgun pointing out of the adjacent car, and a series of tight close-ups on the terrified Phoenix.",
            "The talent of the three protagonists shines. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "It's just sad that the film couldn't rise to the heights of Phoenix.",
            "It is Gray's feel for the kinetic action sequence which is probably We Own the Night's greatest strength.",
            "This is complex stuff, and Gray gives it a sense of gravity that comes through not only in the acting-with Phoenix's increasingly heavy-souled performance anchoring things in nearly every shot-but also the filmmaking.",
            "Director-writer James Gray makes it all seem more urgent than it has any right to feel, because he knows how to make tense, violent dramas that are soaking in mood.",
            "This is a man's movie: gritty, macho, and lacking in grace.",
            "If We Own the Night is flawed and somewhat choppy, it served notice that Gray, once he refined his technique, would be a force to be reckoned with in the cinema world.",
            "Gray assumes rather than dramatizes the depths of his characters, scanning for gravitas where there are only rickety clich\u00e9s",
            "A generic thriller that aims for deeper resonance, We Own The Night is an intriguing feature, undermined by a plot that stretches credulity, yet which still manages to conform to predictable gangster flick clich\u00e9.",
            "Although We Own the Night is never as suspenseful as it wants to be and can be a little formulaic, it never comes close to being boring, and that's something you can't say too often about movies these days.",
            "(We Own the Night) was terribly written and just such a waste of great actors.",
            "The pace may be a shade plodding at times, and the dialogue frequently does disservice to the subject matter. Yet the performances lift it out of the rut...",
            "Lovers of good straightforward thrillers should find plenty to enjoy here.",
            "It's a roller coaster, mainly because a good scene is typically followed by a bad one. For every thrill, there is a melodramatic moment that just doesn't work.",
            "We Own the Night is a film of solid performances but one that tries too hard while stuck in familiar territory.",
            "These are some of the finest actors in America, so it's no surprise that they deliver the goods and create solid, complex and accessible characters we can understand."
