            "This is a real movie, with all those elements that have proved sure-fire through history; Laughter, tears, involvement, thrills, wonderment. Steven Spielberg also adds a message: Human beings and spacelings should learn to co-exist.",
            "Spielberg has crafted with warmth and humor a simple fantasy that works so superbly on so many levels that it will surely attract masses of moviegoers from all demographics.",
            "Steven Spielberg's E. T., The Extra-Terrestrial is the best cinematic fairy tale since The Wizard of Oz.",
            "E.T. ...comes to a beleaguered industry like a gift from the gods. Not only does it get bums on seats but it encourages the kind of shared enjoyment that suggests the cinema still has something unique to offer.",
            "The marvel of this extraordinary movie is that it captures for even the most jaded grownup that pleasurable state of innocence and awe that only children are fortunate enough to experience.",
            "E.T. is essentially a spiritual autobiography, a portrait of the filmmaker as a typical suburban kid set apart by an uncommonly fervent, mystical imagination. It comes out disarmingly funny, spontaneous, bighearted.",
            "A parable and a fairy tale that speaks to the child in us all, and wishes that we could all be more like Elliot, and less like the grown-ups.",
            "A family-friendly, heartwarming science-fiction adventure, full of iconic sequences.",
            "Like the spirits in Poltergeist, suspended between one state of consciousness and another, Spielberg hovers somewhere between childhood and adulthood, unable and unwilling to go over the other side. But then, where would the movie industry be if he did?",
            "E.T. is a unique movie capable of captivating different audiences. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Spielberg's visual inventiveness in much of E.T. is of sufficiently high quality to make one regret those passages where he falls below his best.",
            "Some of the performances are part of the reason why it works so well... I can't think of a child actor that that pulls off such emotional depth.",
            "Director Steven Spielberg knew we'd all fall in love with E.T. for one very good reason: he embodies what we hope all aliens will be like when they finally visit our planet.",
            "No matter how much time passes, E.T. will always be right here.",
            "Spielberg works well with children, but never before has he directed them with such reticence or such appreciation of their humor, intelligence and decency.",
            "It lifts you into its make-believe in the wonderfully enriching way that only movies can do. I wouldn't be surprised if 'E.T.' eventually turned into the kind of durable classic that can be revived indefinitely for future generations.",
            "It's connection, its life, and it's about feelings of love that tends to transcend species and stars.",
            "With a touching relationship at the core of its compelling narrative, along with a brilliant score and nostalgic special effects, E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial remains one of director Steven Spielberg's most beloved films.",
            "It's a fantastical adventure with a grounding in the modern (circa 1982) world of suburbia, divorce, and adolescent anxiety, and E.T. is the ultimate imaginary playmate come to life.",
            "What makes the movie a masterpiece is the intensely visceral way in which Spielberg conveys these children feeling adult emotions for the first time. ",
            "Without a doubt, I can say this is a masterpiece. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Spielberg would seem to be groping towards a virtual theology of space, space as Heaven, offering solace to a world which has foolishly renounced its traditional God but still aches to extend its own spiritual frontiers.",
            "Captivating, endearingly optimistic and magical at times, Steven Spielberg's fantasy about a stranded alien from outer space protected by three kids until it can arrange for passage home is certain to capture the imagination of the world's youth.",
            "What's perhaps most amazing about E.T., what distinguishes it from many of the other fantasy films of its era, is its ability to put an audience under a spell of childlike wonderment without infantilizing it."

            "Today it looks much better, and contains one of Eastwood's most openhearted performances.",

            "Moronic comedy that's pleasant enough until it runs out of steam in the third act.",

            "...the direction falls flat, the script is implausible...and the acting is either forced or dull.",

            "Director Hal Ashby's cut of the film was chopped by Paramount and by producer Schaffel and writers Voight and Schwartz, and it came up weaker for it. In spite of having problems, however, the film is not a complete turkey."

            "This \"expos\u00e9\" is too familiar and too sloppily filmed to shock anyone. ",
            "Corinne's inconsistencies play out in a film that abounds with them, tensions and discrepancies that likely reflect the conflicting visions of its makers but that take nothing away from the movie's feral vigor.",
            "It's a completely \"new-fashioned\" brand of humor, light years from the I-Love-Lucy zaniness of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes or the cool, sophisticated repartee of Stage Door.",
            "Teasing their knee-jerk nihilism while taking just as many potshots at the band's detractors, the movie never really figures out if it's come to praise our proto-riot grrrls or to bury them. ",
            "The film is interesting in its portrayal of rock 'n' roll on the road, though it's unsuccessful as a whole. ",
            "The concept of \"Fabulous\" is crystal clear, but the execution of the film is a disorganized splatter of motivations, studio-mandated recutting, and half-realized subplots.",
            "While Ladies And Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains falls short of being the word on the movement, it is a fascinating, entertaining and authentically grimy trawl through the seamy side of the music-biz.",
            "Nancy Dowd's blueprint has scrappy traces of The Girl Can't Help It (and the seeds of Madonna, Courtney, Britney...), Lou Adler's direction has an exhausted band wrangler's acquaintance with waves and fads. ",
            "A definite gem that deserves more discovering by rock and music buffs."

            "They simply do not build movies like this any more, which is a pity.",

            "Once in a long while a motion picture so eloquently expressive and technically exquisite comes along that one is tempted to hail it as being near perfect.",
            "Attenborough's work lacks even the undercurrent of personality that David Lean brought to his films: the film has no flavor but that of the standard Hollywood hagiography.",
            "\"Gandhi\" underlines the importance of nonviolent demonstration, especially in 2020 when America has been infiltrated by communist influences turning America's masses into \"useful idiots\" by encouraging terrorism as the means to express desire for change.",
            "Kingsley's performance is central to the film's triumph - perhaps surpassing the rest of the technical and artistic values.",
            "The film is triumphantly not a deification, but it is necessarily a simplification, and suffers from some of those disadvantages... But the embattled spirit of respect for human dignity and the need for mutual tolerance flow clearly through the film.",
            "This is a film that provokes healthy doubt even as it pays stirring obeisance to sainthood.",
            "As a whole, Gandhi is never less than intelligent in dealing with the events and facts with which it chooses to deal, and there is never a boring moment.",
            "Although he may look like the real thing, Ben Kingsley begins to sound like a computer reading fortune cookies.",
            "Few people will leave the theater unaffected, or unchanged.",
            "Gandhi is illustrative, but not creative. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "The movie aims primarily to demonstrate how such a man could accomplish so much, but also how monumental his task was and how it ultimately claimed his life",
            "The inability to capture moments of simple, uncomplicated emotion show up the hollowness and over-staged theatricality of Richard Attenborough's Gandhi with exasperating frequency.",
            "Tthe film Gandhi is more stuffy than stately, more prestigious than prodigious. It never quite captures the essence of Gandhi, or the influence he exerted on other leaders, including Martin Luther King. It's a broad but shallow river of information.",
            "Above all, Kingsley's astonishing performance, capturing both Gandhi's divine light and his irresistible simplicity, inspires this ambitious film.",
            "Attenborough shows once again his skill in managing the big set-piece.",
            "While Kingsley (who took one of eight Oscars) is the glue that holds this epic piece together, you must relish a cast that includes John Gielgud, Edward Fox, John Mills, Martin Sheen and Roshan Seth.",
            "It's a slow, reverential biopic, but it compensates for its sedate pace with a dry, gentle humour and a humanity that befits its extraordinary subject.",

            "An extraordinary, often mesmerizing achievement of design and performance that's held back by an underdeveloped script and a milquetoast leading character.",
            "Crystal is a miraculous rush of innovation and storytelling patience, and, in the last 25 years, the film has grown from a 1982 misfire, to a cult wonder, to a bona-fide classic that's timeless in stature and masterful in execution.",
            "Points to the Henson team for trying to broaden the scope of their creatures -- and there's little denying that this particular flick still seems to hold up pretty darn well."

            "Astoundingly tedious.",
            "The picture is completely devoid of cinematic interest, adopting instead a tiresome theatrical aesthetic in which showy monologues are filmed in interminable, usually ill-chosen long takes.",
            "By the end, the accumulated weight and lethargy of the production fails to invest Sophie's fate with the significance Styron achieves.",
            "It's both crushing and triumphant.",
            "For all the significance of the revelations about Sophie's past, it is the interaction between the three central characters that gives the story its strength.",
            "The film is tentative when the story demands voice. Sophie's Choice, no matter how disturbing, remains muted.",
            "Streep and Kline, embodying their characters in a way that goes beyond performing, obliterate the excesses on their straight and stirring journey to the heart.",

            "Whatever the film's weaknesses are, it is, albeit unsurprisingly, saved by Streep.",
            "I found myself more intrigued by the actress than moved by the character, fascinated by Meryl's \"choices\" rather than Sophie's Choice.",

            "And while Meryl Streep's performance is largely worthy of its laurels ... the film around it is much harder to forgive. Beyond Streep, Sophie's Choice is little more than a tediously assembled WWII drama of interminable length.",
            "The way Streep inhabits Sophie, and brings her history to life whether she's explicitly talking about the past or carrying herself across the room with wounded grace, can't help but make parts of the rest of the film seem smaller by comparison.",
            "A suffocating 151 minutes long, with a healthy portion of that running time devoted to a hunk of Holocausploitation of the most crass and cynical variety. And that's the good part.",
            "Stunning to the max, and Streep is memorable as Sophie.",
            "The movie is too Hollywood in look and feel, and the flashback and narration are too conventional, and yet the image of the sickly and pale Meryl Streep recollecting her ordeal lingers in memory long after the film is over.",

            "There's no trace of the Rambo that would become the symbol of American militaristic excess of the '80s in First Blood. ",
            "First Blood is first and foremost an oft-overlooked war classic, spinning the focus and looking at the very real and painful fallout for those involved in such traumatic events. ",
            "As a combination survival and action film, 'First Blood' delivers enough excitement to please fans of this sort of thing, although it must settle logically for a less than wholly satisfying ending.",
            "The character of John Rambo is so identified with Stallone that it's amusing to note how many actors were considered for the role, including Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.",
            "a powerful, complex and captivating film that serves as a blockbuster action film and a serious drama",
            "First and most popular Rambo; and yes, bloody.",

            "Barry Levinson's Diner is an extremely clever, slick male fantasy that takes some time to work out its mood and tone but ultimately blossoms into a moving film.",
            "Levinson's dialogue feels fresh and improvised, yet it hits its mark every time, and the performances he gets are complex and original.",
            "The film is wonderfully cast and played.",
            "For all his painstaking accuracy, Levinson has also concocted a dark and depressing period story devoid of a single person without a major problem or character flaw.",
            "Diner manages to provide quite a bit of entertainment. It should have been so much more, but at least it's the best picture to come out of Baltimore since Polyester.",
            "Diner is a funny, affectionate film... If you're over 30, you may be surprised to remember what a drab era it was and hopeful that men will never again be as dense.",
            "The male quintet of friends is amusingly lampooned in Levinson's clever and cutting script, a refreshingly honest depiction of an era often bathed in sepia-toned nostalgia. ",
            "With so much going for it, then, why doesn't 'Diner' emerge as a major statement? Mostly because of the recurring weakness of its screenplay.",
            "Though nothing much happens this is a skilfully written comedy-drama that plays close attention to character and boasts fine performances by a quality cast.",
            "This gentle, warm-hearted comedy drama about a group of young men in 1950s Baltimore was director Barry Levinson's debut feature and it remains among his finest work.",
            "All the performances are remarkable. Rourke won't stay unknown for long. But the ultimate triumph is Levinson's. He captures both the surface and the soul of an era with candor and precision.",
            "not a great film, but it certainly is memorable",
            "As confused as its male protagonists are about their proper place in the world, it's their relationship to women that beguiles them most. It's also their path to maturity. ",
            "Thoroughly enjoyable nostalgia film about lost youth that's as refreshing as a cup of coffee from a Greek diner.",
            "Made by an insider, Baltimore's son Barry Levinson, who gets the texture and characters right, Diner is one of the most perceptive youth tales about the gulf between the sexes before the subject became a debatable issue.",
            "A witty and biting screenplay is excellently portrayed by an ensemble, who would all soon become big stars.",
            "Not a lot to it, but the sense of period is acute, the script witty without falling into the crude pitfalls that beset other adolescent comedies, and the performances are spot-on.",
            "Even with all its accolades, it's still an underappreciated gem",
            "Diner is often a very funny movie, although I laughed most freely not at the sexual pranks but at the movie's accurate ear, as it reproduced dialogue with great comic accuracy."

            "Leonard Nimoy has rarely been so moving.",

            "... a masterpiece of mood and psychological ambiguity masquerading as a cheap exploitation knock-off. Cheap it is, but Lewton and director Jacques Tourneur create mood not out of what is seen, but what isn't.",
            "While Cat People isn't among the scariest films ever made, there are a trio of truly suspenseful scenes which, quite ingeniously, leave just enough up to the audience's imagination to dial up the tension.",
