            "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the most wonderful lark. It is also a class act.",
            "Not surprisingly, Ford has most of the action here. But Connery -- in what is often a test of a true actor -- shows how much you can do with an essentially passive part.",
            "Fans of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas' Indiana Jones series may rest assured that the latest installment, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, is fully up to, as well as virtually indistinguishable from, its predecessors.",
            "Though Last Crusade lacks the novelty of Raiders (and, by the way, the flat-out breathless pacing of Temple of Doom), it's an entertaining capper to the trilogy.",
            "This is not so much a bad film as a machine-like one lacking the same energy as the original, which it most resembles.",
            "Even if he's considerably more battered than his nearest competitor, Indiana quits at the top of the heap. It's just that the heap isn't what it was eight years ago. It's been almost flattered to death.",
            "One of the greatest finishes to any series in the history of cinema.",
            "Somehow Indiana Jones has forgotten all of the lessons of its forebears, both film and character. It's one thing to make each film similar, it's another to give them amnesia.",
            "Following the second outing, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is able to re-capture the magic that made us fall in love with Indiana Jones.",
            "For a film that clearly sets out to make Indiana Jones his own legend, it does so in every sense of the word.",
            "It has a grand scope and epic scale, still, but we're left with a larger idea of the man wearing the fedora.",
            "Take a good look at this movie. In fact, go back four or five times and take four or five good looks. In this imperfect world, you're not likely to see many manmade objects come this close to perfection.",
            "What we want from Spielberg and Lucas is plenty of action, and plenty of laughs. And that's just what they deliver.",
            "As usual, the action is on an epic scale and delivered with breathless enthusiasm and much panache by director Steven Spielberg.",
            "The Last Crusade is a step backward for [Spielberg], but backwardness is an integral part of the Indy series right from its kiddie-matinee origins.",
            "benign slapstick.",
            "Thrilling third Indy actioner focuses on hunt for grail.",
            "Last Crusade is pure kicks, and I would never fault this spunky blast of quips and near-misses for trying to vanilla its way back into the hearts of millions.",
            "It shows us Indy's origin and even ends with him riding off into the sunset after completing the ultimate quest of finding the Holy Grail. I mean how do you top that?",
            "Captures some of the sense of fun that infused the first movie while using the addition of Sean Connery to up the comedic ante and provide a father/son dynamic.",
            "...it's impossible to deny the film's status as the very best of the series' sequels...",
            "This is reportedly the last time producer/writer George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg will treat movie fans to an Indiana Jones adventure, and it's pretty obvious they were determined to send Indy riding off into the sunset in style.",
            "There's considerable pleasure in watching these two lions spar, but sometimes Last Crusade mistakes dotting every I and crossing every T for detailed character development.",
            "Connery brings out a vastly appealing dorky-kid side of Ford we haven't seen before in the Indy films, and Ford parries with Connery angrily yet lovingly."

            "Born on the Fourth of July is...the most ambitious nondocumentary film yet made about the entire Vietnam experience.",
            "Signaled Oliver Stone's transition from iconic commentator to tremulous anarchist.",
            "Stone has found in Cruise the ideal actor to anchor the movie with simplicity and strength.",
            "Stone has created a film whose overblown parts add up to far less than the epic whole he had in mind.",
            "The eclectic and incredible cast assembled by Stone in this patriotic anti-patriot statement includes Tom Sizemore, Vivica A. Fox and James Le Gros...",
            "The film internalizes Cruise's acting career from beef-cake adolescent lo gung-ho patriot within the Film's plot, transforms him into a serious actor by making him at once handicapped and ugly.",
            "This is not the boy next door. Maybe it never was.",
            "The actor gives a risky, allout performance that makes him an obvious Oscar candidate. But his sacrifice is squandered. By the end of Stone's 140-minute ordeal, it becomes gruesomely clear that the movie is bereft of ideas.",
            "As Kovic, Tom Cruise gives a performance that is adroit, moving and mature. The devices of fiction illuminate fact, but the film gains in power because we know that it is telling a true story.",
            "The movie is all glib explanation... banal in its obviousness and crass in its moralizing.",
            "There's ultimately little doubt that Born on the Fourth of July benefits substantially from Cruise's engrossing and often electrifying turn as the tortured protagonist...",
            "...a tale of American masculinity undone.",
            "Not counting his iconic themes for such blockbusters as Star Wars and Jaws, this might feature John Williams' best music score to date.",
            "An exceptional feature on every level of execution, also displaying a rare sensitivity to Stone that he would spend the rest of his career trying to bury in violence and experimentation. ",
            "Unflinching story of Vietnam vet turned activist.",
            "Cruise's impassioned performance as Kovic is an impressive accomplishment.",
            "Not the sort of movie you actually enjoy, but its thought-provoking subject matter and haunting images are not easily forgotten.",
            "A great performance by Cruise",
            "Though departing from the source material, Ron Kovic's stirring chronicle of his Vietnam experience, this film is a good companion piece to Oliver Stone's Oscar-winner Platoon, showcasing star Tom Cruise in one of his most dramatic performances.",
            "Stone does populist anti-war with a passion.",
            "Made when Oliver Stone still had cred and Cruise wasn't a laughing stock. A fine movie.",

            "One of the most durable -- and characteristic -- comedies of the 1980s.",
            "The film just keeps getting darker and more claustrophobic, like sliding down the center of a spiral.",

            "I think it's very underrated. ",
            "Every once in a while, [the Bond series] pulls in its stomach, pops the gun from its cummerbund, arches its eyebrow and gets off another bull's-eye. The newest, Licence to Kill, is probably one of the five or six best of Bond.",
            "He may look the part, but Timothy Dalton fails the boots, the scuba gear, or the automobiles left him by Moore and Connery.",
            "If the series is ever going to return to its Connery-era glory, it definitely needs some new writers, ones who know how to streamline a story and keep the dialogue tight.",
            "Dalton revives the cool, ironic detachment of the Connery years, but he also allows a touch of obsession to show through Bond`s surface aplomb.",
            "With Dalton straightening out Bond for the second time, Licence to Kill continues the salvage operation begun in The Living Daylights and rescues a series that was in danger of shooting itself in the foot. With a Walther PPK, of course.",
            "The level of violence is unlike any other of the series, making the chief antagonist more formidable, memorable, and ultimately less fun.",
            "Daniel Craig shows the grit, the determination and vulnerability that Bond has...Dalton did that years before!",
            "It may not be up your alley if you're just into Bond films, but it you're in the mood for an old fashioned action film, you can do far, far worse than sticking this film on.",
            "Lacks a bit of that Bond magic. Perhaps not the cruder, formulaic elements of other Bond films, but the lightness of touch and inherent charm in the character of Bond himself.",
            "The movie is really well-structured, simple in plot but rather meaty in delivery.",
            "Some of 007's earlier adventures fail to hold up, but in a post-'Taken' world, 'Licence to Kill' certainly aged well and is a under-appreciated gem in the Bond catalog. ",
            "Licence to Kill gets better as it unfolds for more than two hours. It just takes an insufferably long while to find the right pace.",
            "Licence to Kill ranks as one of the best of the 16 Bond films, thanks to Dalton's athletic, tough and deadly new 007.",
            "As unlikely as it seems, Mr. Dalton actually appears to be growing in the Bond role, which is potentially stifling because its own popularity has so rigidly defined it.",
            "This series' record of maintaining an admirable level of quality stays intact, even if this film might best be used as a cinematic appetizer to see before renting a tape of one of the Connery or Moore classics.",
            "It's a watchable adventure boosted by impressive action sequences and a fiery climax with a bone-crunching punch-up. Pity Dalton didn't have another crack at proving his secret-agent credentials.",
            "Darker version of James Bond has more violence, language.",
            "Anchored by an engaging revenge plot, this Bond film has a great villain, a dark tone and several top-notch action set pieces.",
            "No quips. No smirks. No innuendoes. Just raw, exposed nerves. The traits for which Dalton gets dinged are those looking past the character's admittedly alluring surface pleasures. Women aren't the only things that keep 007 awake at night, you know.",
            "The good: this is beautifully complicated stuff... The bad: simply, that it's not a Bond film.",
            "Licence to Kill gave us a grittier and more ruthless Bond. Dalton can definitely play dark, but he lacks the charisma of Connery",
            "It's a strained, sexless, and overcooked film...Dalton's game, but the film is inert, perhaps unprepared to work with the new Irish Kiss direction of the series.",
            "A well-produced slick high-octane action thriller that remains escapist and as entertaining as possible throughout."

            "The movie is so overblown, so much is meant to dazzle the eye, that it overwhelms the characters and the music.",
            "Fans of the musical \"The Phantom of the Opera\", however, will find plenty to like in this filmic adaptation but its faults could have easily sunk the entire production."

            "The relentless plot is effectively set up and expertly pursued, and Hugh Masekela makes some striking contributions to Dave Grusin's musical score.",
            "It's filled with obvious, earnest performances--Marlon Brando's ironic and subtle one is the only exception--and unresonant writing.",
            "A thumpingly didactic script, but Palcy has crafted a watchable - if not particularly important, given its competition - one.",
            "[Euzhan Palcy] continues with the same concise, to the point directing. The characters' interactions are touching but not sentimental; the politics present without bathos, the excesses of brutality present without being gratuitous.",

            "This movie, directed by a black Martiniquan, Euzhan Palcy, is far more effective [than Cry Freedom] at keeping black actors -- and the essential problem of South Africa -- onscreen. ",
            "That story, unfortunately, is frequently sidetracked as the movie turns instead to gratuitous star cameos by Marlon Brandon and Susan Sarandon.",
            "Its heart is in the right place; its technique is pedestrian.",
            "This adaptation has its flaws, but what lingers is insulated Ben's inaction so juxtaposed with the persecution of Jonathan and then his father. The white man's willful ignorance doesn't just sustain but perpetuates a systemic, brutal, savage racism.",
            "A polemic against South African apartheid, this may not meet criteria for \"great\" filmmaking, but director Euzhan Palcy's film succeeds in being significant.",
            "A wrenching picture about South Africa that makes no expedient compromises with feel-good entertainment values, A Dry White Season displays riveting performances and visceral style.",
            "Tells about the political awakenings in 1976 to apartheid in South Africa.",
            "Whites debating racial injustice: fine for a book published in Afrikaans a decade ago, but a poor premise for a message movie.",

            "Miss Firecracker is a huge cotton candy of a movie -- there's not really much there; but it's gaudy to look at, and sweet going down the gullet.",
            "Warmly human film based on Beth Henley's 1984 play. It will appeal to those who long for liberation from bad dreams and yearn for a place where they can be accepted for who they are.",

            "The fulcrum of the film is Martin. It's an adventurous and successful stroke of casting that takes advantage of what the audience expects from him.",
            "This movie has its share of laughs, but it's also Ron Howard's most personal film, and clearly his most ambitious.",
            "Parenthood easily could have focused exclusively on yuppie parents and their kids; however, the script by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel is more sophisticated than that, remembering that every parent is still a child too.",
            "The remaining cast, young, old and in-between, is lovely.",
            "With Parenthood, Howard as a director has discovered weight, but not gravity. For all of its admirable seriousness, the film finally floats away.",
            "There's not a scene in Parenthood that isn't involving: The actors keep reaching into themselves and coming up with gold.",
            "Plenty of realistic drama makes its way into the slightly exaggerated scenarios.",
            "...an engaging and often engrossing picture that benefits substantially from the efforts of a uniformly superb cast...",
            "The glorification of fatherhood in today's films combined with the portrayal of women in the same movies as little more than breeding machines... is a treason against active motherhood and an attack on women who choose not to have children.",
            "A feel-good sitcom about three generations of middle-class California suburban dwelling parents trying to deal with their vexing children as they experience growing pains.",
            "It's hard to imagine a theme more universal and filled with human pitfalls than parenthood. And it's hard to imagine a movie treatment of that theme more humane and filled with gentle sympathy than director Ron Howard's Parenthood.",
            "Ambitiously probing every anxiety-ridden corner of the suburban mum-and-dad experience, some of its interconnecting story strands work better than others.",
            "Parenthood gets a lot of emotional mileage out of kiddie antics, but Howard has, thankfully, given us a little more.",
            "As Parenthood reveals within its charming, two-hour running time, the pitfalls and quandaries of child-rearing are universal -- and the joys and the heartaches remain lifelong concerns.",
            "This feel-good family ensemble piece from director Ron Howard manages to avoid being oversentimental, and the result is an affectionate, leisurely comedy about the joys (and otherwise) of bringing up children.",
            "There are good jokes and funny observations about middle-class life. The picture is too long and predictable, though.",
            "Here is a comedy that treats the problems and delights of real life with respect, insight, warmth and remarkably sustained wit.",
            "Poignant family dramedy with lots of adult themes.",
            "Howard juggles all the characters effortlessly, showcasing troubles left and right without losing the film to gloom. It's nimble work, blessed with a cast that knows exactly what they're reaching for in their performances.",
            "There is something brave and original about piling up most of our worst parental nightmares in one movie and then daring to make a midsummer comedy out of them. It really shouldn't work, but it does.",
            "While Parenthood crosses the border into schmaltz a number of times, the movie runs the gamut of realistic emotions, and one scene or another is bound to hit home with the parents who see the film.",
            "An ambitious, keenly observed, and often very funny look at one of life's most daunting passages...",
            "Nothing more than sitcom material stretched to two hours."

            "A master class in pacing and escalation, writer/director Steve De Jarnatt (Cherry 2000) crafts in Miracle Mile a John Hughes meets George Miller all-timer.",
            "Its doomsday anxiety is more powerful than blockbuster disaster movies with much bigger budgets.",
            "Edwards doesn't quite possess the gravitas necessary to authenticate the end of the world, but he holds Miracle Mile together amiably enough, such that we do actually care what happens.",

            "Milos Forman and Jean-Claude Carriere, while fiddling with the plot of this deliciously nasty tale, have studiously embalmed its spirit.",
            "The results are too pretty and well acted to be a total washout, but the fascination with evil and power that gives the novel intensity is virtually absent; what remains is mainly petty malice and mild cynicism.",
            "The anachronistic brio which distinguishes Forman's style is in pleasurable evidence, the approach to the subject is very much his own, and it's worth seeing if you forget all about the original.",
            "Because there are no characters animating his panorama, all this serves to prove is that though Forman's movie is broader than Frears', it is also shallower.",
            "Milos Forman's film is a mere confection in comparison to Stephen Frear's one, but in the way that confections can give real entertainment.",
            "An unqualified dud.",
            "Directed by Milos Forman, this film is livelier, more absorbing, and generally better acted than Dangerous Liaisons, which arrived a year ago. But it runs out of inspiration long before it runs out of plot twists.",
            "Insufficiently racy in tone as well as pacing, this accomplished but bland costume drama is Dangerous Liaisons' poor cousin.",
            "The effect is like an ermine violin: It is beautiful to look at, but it doesn't play.",
            "Valmont plays like a period sex romp, its concerns reduced to the level of who sleeps with whom and who gets dumped.",
            "While Frears's is truer to the calculating spirit of the book and has the showier cast, Forman's has greater human interest and the more heartfelt performances.",
            "What keeps the film interesting, if not riveting, is the generally on target casting and resulting topnotch interpretations.",
            "It's a warm, energetic, humorous film, with some excellent ensemble playing; but the cruelty and psychological complexity are lost, and the ensuing tragedy has little resonance.",
            "Just as good as that other one, maybe better.",
            "Nice try, but Glenn, John and Michelle did it much better",

            "The crippling flaw in the film lies in its mix of surface daring and inner funk. Inside, it keeps flinching.",
            "Although newcomer Michael Chiklis turns in a sterling performance, Wired never allows him to explain why Belushi was such an infuriatingly drug-sodden slob, and sadly for a movie about a funny man its woefully short on humour.",
            "A good portion of the film's stroll down memory lane attempts to recreate some of the Belushi-Dan Aykroyd SNL routines, and they look pale by comparison with the real things.",
            "Every time the film makes some sense, the sweaty and sleepless face of Belushi invades in close-up and we know it`s only a matter of time before director Peerce will make us privy to the comic`s needless death.",
            "The reenacted Saturday Night Live routines that made Belushi a star seem grim.",
            "This crude low-budget exploiter is one of the most grotesque character assassinations ever put on film.",
            "The picture certainly succeeds at reproducing Belushi's manic energy and wired-up sensibility. But it fails to give any meaningful insights into a couple of issues that must be dealt with if his biography is to have any enduring value.",
            "The film is commendable for neither preaching and nor excusing, for its depiction of the pressures of show business, which have an ugly-accurate, insider's feel, and for its excellent performances.",
            "Relentlessly offputting.",
            "A profoundly trivial and tasteless affair.",

            "When Harry Met Sally is a beautiful, brainy, touching and lilting romantic comedy that should touch the heartstrings of lovers and those yearning to be in love everywhere.",
            "Cynically lovely and a whip smart archetype for the modern rom-com.",
            "Ephron's tart, grown-up script examines the inevitably of love finding a way despite the fight put up by this famous pair of snappy New Yorkers.",
            "Still a treat.",
            "Quite possibly the greatest romantic comedy since Some Like It Hot.",
            "Reiner wants to maintain the sitcom sense of comfort and familiarity; he creates types that we somehow already know, slightly out-of-focus images in which we can see ourselves and our friends.",
            "One of the very best romantic comedies of its time.",
            "The title informs audiences they will hear about the circumstances surrounding the meeting of Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan)... but the ellipsis suggests it is not the meeting itself that is the story. It is all about what happens after.",
            "The movie's brush strokes are bright, the finished canvas is pleasing but uninspired.",
            "It has aged perfectly. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "Very, very funny.",
            "Even if you don't agree with its leanings, the movie is witty enough to break down any and all resistance.",
            "When Harry Met Sally... remains the gold standard some thirty years later when it comes to the romantic comedy genre.",
            "An outright masterpiece of romance, comedy, and cinema itself.",
            "Just as fresh, witty and warm as it was in 1989.",
            "While it may be packed with whip-smart, endlessly quotable dialogue and laugh-out-loud moments, its enduring popularity undoubtedly stems from the fact that it has genuine heart.",
            "This film is your Christmas treat, and unless you die of a seasonal surfeit it will take you into the New Year laughing out loud.",
            "When Harry Met Sally pleasantly affirms the institution of marriage while showing how difficult it is to achieve a lasting one.",
            "Reiner and his stars, Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, are better at displaying the foibles of human natures than exploring them. ",
            "The summer's uncorseted, unqualified delight.",
            "As played winningly by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, there is a quirky chemistry created in their offbeat pairing.",
            "What knocks it out of the park is the combination of Ephron's insights and Reiner's matchless comic chops.",
            "The fake-orgasm-in-a-deli set piece propelled Ryan into stratospheric stardom, but there are numerous other pleasures to be found in Nora Ephron's Oscar-nominated screenplay and Rob Reiner's astute direction.",
            "When Harry Met Sally is funny and likable, but it will be a torture chamber for anxious singles."

            "A vampire satire with real bite.",
            " As Vampire's Kiss unspools, the lead character, Peter Loew (Cage), wavers in and out of this accent and a wide variety of voices, seeming to give every role Cage has ever played (or would ever play, past, present and future) equal vocal time in the film.",
            "100-minute-long piece of performance art masquerading as a moody, silly indie switchblade. Rarely impresses, succumbing to overwhelmingly sluggish filmmaking decisions and a permissive attitude that robs the picture of its...well...bite.",

            "When a forty-four-year-old man makes a movie about his family and friends sitting around singing old tunes, you certainly don't expect an unforgettable amalgam of humor and heartbreak. But that is precisely what Terence Davies delivers.",
            "A terribly beautiful film... [that] makes one at times almost forget the simultaneously banal and and violent lives which the film remembers.",
            "Strange and stunning for a variety of reasons, Terence Davies created a masterpiece right out of the gate with his 1988 classic Distant Voices, Still Lives.",
            "The saddest part of Distant Voices/Still Lives is that we come away understanding no more than we did before about the inner workings of this and similar families.",
            "Terence Davies' 1988 debut Distant Voices, Still Lives, newly rereleased by Arrow Academy, deserves to be treasured as one of the great British films. ",
            "Distant Voices contains some of the most beautiful, poetic filmmaking in British cinema.",
            "Even the movie's \"smile though your heart is aching\" optimism is depressing. What keeps the movie going is the director's always distinctive, sometimes arresting style, and the earnest, authentic acting.",
            "Screen dreams are strangest and strongest when they hit close to home. In Terence Davies' searing [Distant Voices, Still Lives]... mystery resides in the vision of his mother, magically poised on the hall sill, washing the outside windows.",
            "A rigorously controlled account of the experience of Davies's older siblings growing up in a working-class Merseyside terrace in the Forties and Fifties.",
            "Sadly, most of the time Distant Voices is a hit parade of Father's swiftest punches played to the hit parade that he might have been listening to on the radio.",
            "It's a movie of astonishing power and bold originality, marked by poignant humor and a stream of transcendent song that tempers the frequent harshness of the story.",
            "The editing is relegated to a series of quick (often mercifully so) blackouts. Time shifts occur at random and often confuse.",
            "Tinted with all the sensuous pathos of a faded photograph, Terence Davies' 1988 debut remains one of the most stunning British films ever made.",
            "In this very personal portrait, Davies, the artist, has re-created universal experiences -- familiar passions and needs -- that draw us to his family's humanity.",
            "Arguably Terence Davies' masterpiece, this poetic evocation of the director's childhood in Liverpool is highly stylized and original in conception and execution.",
            "This isn't a film based on nostalgia, though; its very special qualities stem from the beautiful simplicity of direction, writing and playing, and the accuracy of the incidents depicted.",

            "Brilliant, unique and poignant autobiographical drama.",

            "Put it up there with the most astonishing animated features ever made.",

            "The movie, even at 124 minutes, has the densely packed sweep and go-for-it pep of a pop epic.",
            "I've seen the movie four times, and this go-around my jaw was lower on the floor than ever before, somehow.",
            "It's dark and violent but, because it is so creative, it is a really fun experience. It's like Inception but way more trippy!",
            "It continues to show the best of the genre, almost 30 years later. It would be sacrilegious to give a different rating from PERFECT to AKIRA. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Handsome and preposterously ambitious, and even its worst narrative missteps are a factor of that ambition.",
            "[Akira] is a blast and a half, a twisted dystopian parable of violence and rock and roll, Japanese-style. It's Disney on PCP, mean, rotten, psychotic, but incredibly vivid.",
            "Extremely violent classic introduced anime to Westerners.",
            "Moments that can only be captured as animation make Akira still worth watching: gusts of wind from chopper blades, ka-tooming bursts of fiery explosions, Tetsuo's visions.",
            "Plenty of superb recent blockbusters, including The Matrix, The Dark Knight, Minority Report, Dark City and Inception, are all in its debt - not to mention a fair number of shockers, like Star Wars Episode II and the most recent Resident Evil atrocity.",
            "The cityscapes are awesome, the camerawork is dizzying. If you're new to manga, prepare to be converted.",
            "Akira is pure concentrated cinematic excellence - accept no substitutes.",
            "When you absolutely, positively have to get some anime in your life, accept no substitutes; 23 years on, Akira is still the genre's crowning achievement.",
            "Like Snow White before it, Akira was a step change in what animation could show.",

            "One need not be a Cameron acolyte to recognise that The Abyss has aged better than some of the films that outshone it back in the day.",

            "As a follow-up to Cameron's great sci-fi Aliens, The Abyss is too verbose for an actioner and the special effects, striking as they are, are not well integrated into the narrative, but it's still worth seeing.",

            "The idea of doing a dark, neurotic, highly stylized and highly claustrophobic superproduction is an audacious and appealing one, but director Tim Burton has only made it halfway there.",

            "Highly recommended even for fans who think Batman begins and ends with Nolan's trilogy.",
            "[Nicholson] has never been more commanding. Not only because he does an outstanding job, but also because so much of the movie's creative energy is devoted to making the Joker one of the most startling movie characters in recent memory.",

            "[A] special experience, sort of an It's a Wonderful Life for the late '80s.",
            "Widely regarded as a modern populist classic, the film is both a fabulist fable and a celebratory baseball movie that acknowledges scandal within the sport but also the game's transcendent ability to rise above attempts to damage its integrity. [Blu-ray]",
            "One of the best films of the 80s",

            "The conception is sentimental, but the storytelling remains assured and effective.",
            "Together with moments of dry humour and fine performances, the political element lends the film gravity sufficient to counterbalance any sense of whimsy. Pure magic."

            "a future classic",
            "The movie is -- intentionally or otherwise -- a remarkable parable about denying reality until reality catches up to you.",

            "The stylish, cartoon-like opening credits reminded me of the snazzy beginnings of the Peter Sellers-Pink Panther movies.",
            "One of Spielberg's finest pieces of storytelling. Helps make up for A.I.",
            "Steven Spielberg's new film is lighthearted and enjoyable, with just enough undercurrents of human frailty to keep the story interesting.",

            "''Harlem Nights,'' it's worth remembering, is a comedy, though as the body count piles up and entire reels go by without a joke in sight, it's also easy to forget.",
            "If he's going to confine himself to bad movies like \"Harlem Nights,\" it's probably better that he writes and directs them himself.",
            "Harlem Nights offers a depressing answer to that not entirely pressing question, \"Will success spoil Eddie Murphy?\" It looks as if it has.",
            "The plot exposition gets laborious in spots, the period flavor is only occasional and approximate, and the direction tends to be clunky, yet the strong secondary cast helps to take up some of the slack.",
            "Unfortunately, a real comedy needs a decent plot, interesting characters and some kind of creative context to work out of.",
            "If only it had played funnier.",
            "Scoring high marks alternatively for repellent dialogue, staging and characterizations as well as deadly boredom, Harlem Nights may well be the worst major movie of 1989.",
            "\"Harlem Nights\" is billed as an action-comedy, but it doesn't blend the two very smoothly.",
            "What this film suffers from is lack of fun.",
            "The plan was to make a latter-day version of a 1930s gangster movie; the result has some nifty costumes, luscious sets and neat music, but, on almost every other count, it's a mess.",
            "In the end, there's no soul to be had in this city of appearances.",
            "The story, spread thin over two hours, owed something to better films but is entirely devoid of charm, wit, acting skill or excitement.",
            "The plot is a standard recycling of rival gangs battling for turf, and the stunner is why Murphy found any interest in his own script.",
            "Murphy wrote and directed this period piece which doesn't hold back on the strong language and profanity... but to humorous effect.",
            "Despite a flimsy script and a vain director, some of the supporting cast give spirited performances.",
            "Murphy's writing is about as snappy as a Sunday school lesson. The constant obscenities become a distraction and an eventual turnoff, and seem to be used when the writer and director can't invent something more creative.",
            "The movie is a whirlingly divergent romp, blending serious violence with outrageous comedy, but it has the feel of oral history, of lives and times rescued from oblivion.",
            "This blatantly excessive directorial debut for Eddie Murphy is overdone, too rarely funny and, worst of all, boring.",
            "Harlem Nights is a bloated period piece, brandishing big production values, one or two good performances (notably Pryor and Aiello), the occasional laugh, and a spectacularly duff sub-Sting storyline that doesn't so much climax as go prematurely limp.",
            "Not as bad as you might think, but not all that good either.",
            "Mr. Murphy's effort is distinguished by his own singular presense as an actor, and by the delight he takes in appearing with his various co-stars."

            "One of the stodgier King adaptations of its period, Pet Sematary 1989 squanders much of its promise with cardboard performances, flat direction and a dire lack of both emotional heft and chilly mood.",
            "The premise is fascinating, but the leaden direction, weak performances from the leads, and King's frequently campy interludes pretty much sink this one.",
            "Some genuinely great scares... Fred Gwynne completely and utterly steals the show.",
            "While this is one of the best King adaptations, it does have some pacing issues, especially in the middle. The story drags a bit, but by the third act everything is moving at a breakneck pace.",

            "It benefits from Dante's inventive direction, but it's hampered by an insufferable character in Ducommun's Art as well as an unfortunate (if predictable) denouement that totally upends the sturdy theme and edgy moralizing that would have made this unique.",

            "Do the Right Thing is so much larger than its Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn setting. That small slice of street acts as a microcosm for the entire racial system in America-one that is still at work and even more prevalent today.",

            "The vignettes are hilarious, wistful, romantic, frustrating, and tragic. Lee's pacing is masterful, and he knows just when to slow things down to give us a glimpse at the lives of these people, and when to crank up the tension another notch.",

            "Woody Alton's films alternate between the comic, in which he himself stars, and the serious and even solemn, which he does not Crimes and Misdemeanors successfully combines both styles.",
            "It is both a civilised comedy with iron in its soul and a serious examination of our inner fears that also manages to be very funny.",
            "The overall 'philosophical' thrust -- that good guys finish last and that crime does pay -- is designed to make the audience feel very wise, but none of the characters or ideas is allowed to develop beyond its cardboard profile.",
            "The structural and stylistic conceit is that when Landau is onscreen, the film is dead serious, even solemn, while Allen's own appearance onscreen signals hilarious satire and priceless one-liners.",
            "Dramatically, the film seldom fulfils its promise, and its pessimistic 'moral' -- that good and evil do not always meet with their just deserts -- looks contrived and hollow. Intriguing and patchily effective, nevertheless.",
            "The movie's secret strength -- its structure, really -- comes from the truth of the dozens and dozens of particular details through which it arrives at its own very hesitant, not especially comforting, very moving generality.",
            "At times the movie observes, patiently, the characters and their predicaments, seemingly going nowhere.",
            "The film's entertainment value outweighs its irritations.",
            "Among other comedians and gag writers, Woody Allen is known as the master craftsman -- the Albrecht Durer of neurotic urban jokes.",
            "Dark Woody Allen comedy-drama about adultery, murder.",
            "Nervy and unnerving...arguably the purest expression of Allen's cinematic vision. [Blu-ray]",
            "A truly brilliant study of murder and its psychological effects on the people that dare commit it.",
            "Using the paper-thin lead characters as symbols to show how blind people are about themselves and their relationships has little gravitas, but the comedy is stinging.",
            "The result is a frighteningly intelligent, and often hilariously funny whole.",
            "Allen's expertise is evident everywhere.",
            "Um discurso filos\u00f3fico-religioso sobre moralidade e culpa que, por incr\u00edvel que pare\u00e7a, n\u00e3o apenas comove como tamb\u00e9m nos faz rir de maneira surpreendente.",
            "Allen starts with a sketchy premise and after working it through for 107 minutes he still has no more than the premise he started with.",
            "Intelligent, insightful and funny. One of Woody Allen's best films.",
            "This examination of the nature of evil interweaves masterfully comedy and melodrama in equal proportion. Instead of taking a casually brutal approach, Allen dwells on the consequences of sin.",
            "Near top of line Woody Allen with Alda, Landau, Huston shining.",
            "...this dark meditation on justice and the lack of it may be his best film."

            "Gritty yet uplifting tale of artist with cerebral palsy.",

            "A fairly generic biopic with an amazing turn by Daniel Day-Lewis.",
            "Deviating from the standard Hollywood biopic, Sheridan's chronicle told with candor, realism, and humor the story of paraplegic writer-artist Christy Brown, embodied in a tour-de-force Oscar-winning performance by Daniel Day-Lewis.",
            "Even if all My Left Foot had to offer was Day-Lewis's performance, it'd be a must-see movie.",

            "Daniel Day-Lewis gives a startling, dazzling performance.",

            "A rich cinematic experience, this uplifting British production will leave you in awe of the extraordinary Christy Brown.",
            "This wonderful film, perfect in setting the scene of the era and locale, could not be a better story of hope and inspiration.",
            "It's easy to imagine what My Left Foot might have looked like in the hands of a lesser director like, say, Ron Howard.",

            "The movie runs out of -- excuse me again -- energy in the late going, and the invention of the humor is uneven. But Serious plays the title role with charm and lightness. His wild red hair makes Don King's look like a crewcut.",
            "Considering the pre-opening buildup this film has had, it could turn out to be a bigger bomb than the one Einstein's theory anticipated.",

            "It has the charm and advantage of a genuine visual style of its own, both laconic and witty, as well as a likably dopey plot and cast of characters.",

            "I couldn't even make it through this movie! Did anyone?",

            "Serious, a long-haired gangly clown, exhibits a brash and confident sense of humor, endearing personality, and a fondness for sight gags.",
            "The episodic structure and slapstick humour keep the pace superficially bubbling along, but given a flimsy intellectual base, form and content are at odds with one another.",

            "The sheer volume and invention of Gilliam's visual largess sets him apart, and his wit operates for the most part at a dangerously sophisticated level.",
            "One of the most voluptuously beautiful films ever imagined, Munchausen naturally assumes that surrealism is preferable, that through make-believe we find the way to true beliefs.",
            "A lavish fairy tale for bright children of all ages.",
            "The king is completely out-of-control, and so was Gilliam in making this film. Neither has much of a sense of proportion, but both are hard to ignore.",
            "There is much to see on this journey, all of it presented in the abundant, deep-focus detail that is Gilliam's visual trademark.",
            "A fitting final installment in Terry Gilliam's trilogy begun with Time Bandits and continued with Brazil.",
            "Like a more family-friendly, comical, delirious take on Sinbad's swashbuckling exploits; a fusion of mythology, fairy tales (particularly Grimms'), history, and legends.",
            "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen is a fairy tale of large heart and limitless vision. Like its maker, it staunchly defies the exigencies of reason to pursue a bigger vision of imagination.",
            "The carnivalesque chaos is anchored in stage actor John Neville's charismatic lead turn.",
            "Superbly photographed and marvelously lighted, this remarkable set piece of art direction and stunning decor cures many of its own ills, including a screenplay that meanders grandly.",
            "Its intellectual intent and the physical production seem disconnected, leaving a film that bedazzles the eye even as it bedevils the mind.",
            "It's an opulent odyssey that balances romance, comedy and thrills in one glittering and constantly surprising package.",
            "For a picture big on in-camera special effects, few of the explosions and set pieces can eclipse the parade of cracking performances.",
            "The narrative is highly episodic and only intermittently engaging, but Gilliam's wildly inventive mise en scene, ably assisted by production designer Dante Ferretti, is extraordinary.",
            "Like many of Gilliam's cerebral, impish films, Munchausen toes the line between rationality and fantasy, gleefully incorporating both into the same story.",
            "...probably the purest expression of Gilliam's Rococo imagination...",
            "Like its hero, extraordinary in every way. [Blu-Ray review]",
            "A gaudy chimera with no other reason for its existence than to be flamboyant to no great end.",
            "Making your way through the film is like eating an entire beautifully sculpted wedding cake.",
            "Despite a second-act sag, the visuals make The Adventures of Baron Munchausen a worthwhile film.",
            " As vastly expensive pieces of set tumble everywhere one cannot help but consider that white elephants, whilst they mat be a burden to keep, are splendid things to look at."
