            "Feature(s) a truly gorgeous, sweeping score by Oscar winning composer Dario Marianelli, filled with soaring choirs and massive crescendos. Had the film shown the same kind of epic emotional fervor as its music it would have been a great film indeed.",
            "Agora is intelligent, stirring and, as the cultural devastation wrought by religious zealots plays out on screen, heartbreaking. ",
            "Filled with literal and metaphysical stone throwing between the religions, Agora is saddled with a muddy narrative and too many blokes who look alike.",
            "Ambitious, sprawling and melodramatic, this sword-and-sandal epic lacks subtlety and struggles to provide much charm - ultimately dissolving into a rather obvious morality tale about the rise of fundamentalism. ",

            "Agora could have been a powerfully subversive feminist film, but while it does have its moments it never truly lives up to its ambitious potential.",
            "Somehow sessions of platonic inquiry interleaved with scenes of battle and riots do not make for a very gripping film. This one is sludgy in the extreme.",
            "Earnest but dull, Agora is about the clash of science and religion, but the filmmaking elements never quite create the necessary sparks.",
            "A flat-footed, studious stroll through what most folks would consider a long-forgotten chapter of history.",
            "Well researched, and anchored by Rachel Weisz's impressive lead performance, this is a fascinating film that avoids the Hollywood epic route.",
            "A contentious piece of history in which we see how the most primitive aspects of fundamental religious beliefs drove public life and generated hatreds ... ",
            "How can it be that this powerful, exciting, provocative movie has been all but overlooked this year?",
            "A landscape where heart and head can collide in a great fury, and when the world felt like it could go one way or the other.",
            "Just preaching to the choir - even a secular choir - isn't enough.",
            "Despite noble intentions and bloody nods to religious intolerance, this historic epic can feel like a drippy toga party",
            "Despite the bloodthirstiness of the Christian mob there's a surprising lack of dramatic tension.",
            "All of the ideas and themes it puts forth are fascinating and could be quite enlightening for the modern age, if the film they were attached to was even a tiny bit fun to watch."

            "Aside from putting flesh on the bones of characters, there are ways in which a movie can surpass a book. In this case it's through the power of music-both aural and visual.",
            "It's an amazing story.",
            "The subject matter is a little too easy to overdo for that, but it is pretty good, thanks to a pair of fine performances from its leads and a director who understands understatement. And sometimes those can be as rare to find as a genuine musical prodigy.",
            "The Soloist never completely transcends that Hollywood formula feel, but it has enough transcendent moments to make it worth recommending.",

            "\"The Soloist\" is not a film in which you anticipate Robert Downey Jr. will be twice doused in urine. Such are the territorial markings of Joe Wright, whose directorial quirks undermine moving moments and committed performances in this musical biopic.",
            "The two actors work beautifully together, playing characters who are angry and frustrated in their different ways, and sentimentality is kept firmly at bay.",
            "Intelligent and uncompromising, with knock-out performances from Downey Jr. and Foxx.",

            "Broken Embraces is certainly moody, and that's one of its charms. But behind the style is disappointing substance, a melodramatic story that's as old as Hollywood.",
            "Cruz delivers a role with wit and elegance, but there's a vacuum sapping the energy she tries to offer. So much for a film that tries too hard to be original.",
            "Since her star-making turn in Volver, Cruz has evolved into a great actress, whose films the audience longs to return to: she and Almod\u00f3var have created whole and complete worlds. Indeed, Broken Embraces mirrors our own - but brightly.",
            "... Broken Embraces is a well-written story of a love so precious it hurt.",
            "The entire third act is anticlimactic and forgettable, and one has to wonder why Mr. Almod\u00f3var has to let his penchant for melodrama ruin a well executed noir.",

            "This gleefully ironic comic fable feels different in tone from the likes of Vicky Christina Barcelona and Match Point. Woody has dusted off an old screenplay from the early 1970s that he'd originally written for Zero Mostel, shelved when the star died.",
            "Whatever works est\u00e1 llena de momentos geniales y divertidos, pero tambi\u00e9n de cierta humanidad en sus personajes que suele ser disfrazada de sarcasmo. Un verdadero show de Larry David, gentileza de Woody Allen.",

            "The heart of the film belongs to Wood, Clarkson and Begley Jr., and they provide the biggest laughs. Watching their Southern-charm slowly transformed (corrupted?) by the emotional/artistic/erotic flavours of New York City is a typical Allen-esque treat.",

            "Fans of their Scary Movie and its sequels know what to expect, though perhaps even they will notice here a thinning in the comedy and a coarsening in its misogynist and homophobic riffs. Not an honest laugh in 90 minutes.",
            "In this enjoyably dirty-minded sendup of when-ballet-met-hip-hop youth musicals, the Wayans brothers hand the directorial reigns over to their nephew, Damien Dante Wayans, who piles on the stupid/smart gags with just the right what-the-hell abandon.",
            "Plain bad. Wrong bad. Horribly bad.",

            "As indignity and amateurishness battle for depressing precedence, Dance Flick becomes the comedy equivalent of torture porn, albeit with worse SFX and notably fewer laughs.",

            "An engrossing suspense thriller that refreshingly doesn't cheat the audience in terms of valid clues and plot twists.",

            "The key to this movie is O'Quinn as the title character. He's a scary bastard, and as an actor he commits to the role.",
            "The Stepfather works for American Eagle Realty, and the company logo pegs him as both a patriot and a predator. 'It's like living with Ward Cleaver,' his stepdaughter complains, not knowing that the 'cleaver' reference could be another pun...",
            "...ultimately manages to overcome its almost aggressively uneven atmosphere to establish itself as a solid little '80s thriller.",

            "A high water mark of 1980s horror/suspense.",
            "Borrowing from Hitchcock (Shadow of a Doubt) and Kubrick (The Shining), Ruben's elegant, darkly humorous tale deconstructs patriarchy and can't be divorced from the Republican family values that dominated the 1980 with their 1950s retro feel.",
            "One of the classiest thrillers to never come out of Hollywood",

            "Playing up the romantic angle to a skin-crawling degree, The Young Victoria peters out with the kind of anachronistic \"you complete me\" movie love song by Sinead O'Connor that threatens to sink the whole enterprise in a river of schmaltz. ",

            "Antal's attempts to crank up the tension are telegraphed far too often and undermined by a flagrant disregard for logic, meaning this never delivers quite enough bang for your buck.",

            "Russell was a fascinating character and a real puzzle box; but the filmmakers have turned his life into a broad farce with one wocka-wocka gag after another.",
            "[The] elaborate cons may be fascinating, daring stuff, but the heart of the picture is the romantic relationship, which is squeezed out to the edges.",
            "Yes, some familiar Carrey tactics are on display, but the star's performance has real heart - it's easily the best thing he has done since Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.",
            "Just the kind of role Carrey needed to stir up some controversy and deliver himself another chance to be seen in a slightly new light on the big screen.",
            "Far too tragic to be funny and far too funny to be tragic.",

            "Hilariously forthright about Steven's sexuality in ways queer problem dramas rarely begin to suggest, I Love You Phillip Morris lights a path for American gay cinema beyond niche-oriented indies and bigger-budget films about martyred role models.",
            "[E]asily one of the best comedies of the last several years.",
            "Jim Carrey succeeds but the film is too mean-spirited and its supporting players too one-dimensional to make this story worthwhile.",
            "Even when the movie's doing something stupid, you just bemusedly shake your head and dive right back in, forgiving everything, even if you don't know why. Isn't that what love's all about?",

            "Jim Carrey brings dynamo force to the story of a brilliant con man and the guy he loved",

            "You have to hand it to Jim Carrey. He could take the easy paycheck time after time in bland movie after bland movie, but he keeps on running down these weird roads and that's where he winds up doing his best work."

            "There are some well-executed sequences, but the story makes nothing but a mess of its borrowed ideas.",
            "Pandorum is dumb, noisy fun. Its flaws are inoffensive inasmuch as Alvart doesn't give off Anderson's noxious vibe of insincerity.",
            "Action mayhem full of gibbering hominoids, hanging corpses and a few live stars.",

            "As for Haneke's handling of the material, his directing is immaculate. Every moment is the product of a penetrating mind and a steady talent.",
            "Far from enjoyable escapism, The White Ribbon is nonetheless utterly compelling and quite beautiful in its unsettling presentation of this prosaic evil.",
            "The White Ribbon is a stark, contemplative and hauntingly brilliant film.",
            "Writer-director Michael Haneke doesn't pull any punches, but then he doesn't throw any wild ones, either. His filmmaking shows precisely the sort of obsession with control that the movie itself is denouncing. Interesting, you've got to admit.",
            "A disquieting feeling of apprehension is made palpable in The White Ribbon.",
            "Haneke is typically elusive, but he does create an indelible portrait of a repressed, authoritarian society in which the sins of the fathers are being laid upon the children.",
            "An engrossing, mesmerizing and involving cinematic journey that is unforgettable as a journey that is both intimate and universal.",
            "The White Ribbon is one of the most gorgeous films in recent memory, with one of the blackest condemnations of human nature.",
            "The White Ribbon may present difficult themes and have spiky edges and perhaps could not be described as entertainment but, as a piece of cinema, it is undoubtedly stunning. ",
            "Haneke both enthralls and repells us, luring us into a world where all feelings are buried deep beneath the quaint and idyllic surface.",
            "Haneke's rigorous control of his material is so unerring, and the acting so eerily and chillingly perfect, it works simply as a portrait of this community at this particular time. ",
            "The themes, though sometimes applied heavy-handedly, have timeless meaning.",
            "But along with a finely crafted screenplay, the film's truly brilliant touch, and what makes this nightmarish fable all the more effective and original, is its stunning black and white photography.",
            "The White Ribbon breathes an unholy life into the generation of children who would grow up to become the obedient soldiers and members of the Nazi party.",
            "It magnetizes us through profound degrees of mystery, psychology, dramatic intensity and perceptive dialogue, and then still retains enough power after the closing credits to leave us in thoughtful contemplation of its more cerebral perspectives.",
            "After reflecting on the film awhile, I found that I had been drawn into its beauty and its mystery too much not to give it at least a slight recommendation.",
            "This film is a total drag to watch. It is slow. It is dark. It is depressing, and it seems as though it is never going to end. It is torture to sit through this film. It runs 144 minutes and seems twice that long.",
            "The White Ribbon is Michael Haneke's masterpiece. It is not a movie about abstract concepts or a director's power over his characters - well, at least it's not just about those things. ",
            "Un inquietante cuadro social, filmado en riguroso blanco y negro, y una reflexi\u00f3n sombr\u00eda y perturbadora sobre el origen del mal, o al menos de cierto tipo de males.",
            "The White Ribbon is a striking, in many ways indelible work, and it's tempting to be carried away by Haneke's craft and assurance as a filmmaker. ",
            "Up close, it's a blur of meticulous details that don't quite make sense; but step back and its towering ambitions become indelibly apparent.",
            "A direct and simple human lesson -- that negative reinforcement creates negative consequences.",
            "Haneke knows how violence seeps into every recess of our lives, and he evokes it not to titillate, but to engage and challenge"

            "Jeunet is going for a Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton kind of thing, trying to tell a story visually, but that doesn't mean that he can't explore some of the deeper elements. While \"Micmacs\" is still a good, fun movie, it could have been so much more.",
            "...maybe there is such a thing as too much whimsy. Where Amelie made me believe that there was no limit on how many quirks characters could have, Micmacs reminded me that a series of quirks do not make a character. ",

            "It's superbly directed but the story just isn't involving and the characters are empty shells. Knowing how awesome this director can be, MICMACS was a major letdown.",

            "Drew Barrymore makes her directing debut with a join-the-dots sports outing that's so brightly played - and so essentially sweet-natured - that its manifest cliches come up smelling of fresh paint.",
            "Although there's nothing original about it, and although it's handled competently rather than with breathtaking \u00e9lan, it's almost impossible to dislike...",
            "Deftly moderating her patented eye-rolling poseur shtick, Page delivers her most charismatic and least divisive performance to date as Bliss Cavendar, aka Babe Ruthless.",
            "If the film were any more brainless, it would be a lump of rock. But if it were any less brainless, it might be less fun.",
            "It's just \"Footloose\" goes to the roller derby.",
            "Surprisingly touching moments of realisation and emotional connection manage to rise above the dramatic cliches that pepper the rest of the film and account for the best scenes in Whip It. Next to all the punch-ups on the track, that is.",
            "It's a surprisingly boring, hopeless sports drama with a flat narrative that dissipates as quickly as the tracks of a roller skate on asphalt. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "To put it simply, DREW BARRYMORE WHIPS UP A WINNER WITH WHIP IT!",
            "Though Whip It celebrates risk-taking ladies, its plot turns gently from one formulaic moment to the next. The only surprise is just how much silliness Barrymore is willing to commit.",
            "The directorial debut of Drew Barrymore is a light and entertaining slice of girl power with another strong performance from Ellen Page.",
            "The story is not particularly original, but the milieu is, and so is the energy in this ode to girl power.",
            "Though it's got first-timer mistakes (too long, too many food fights) its indie-rock girl-power charms are, like co-star Kristen Wiig, undeniable.",
            "Neither as consistently funny nor as charming as it would like to think; yet Page's sincere performance brings some extra gravitas to an otherwise unremarkable script.",
            "When a movie is this carefree, and this surprising, and this much fun, and makes you feel this glad to be a woman, it's easy to forgive a lot of faults. ",
            "An '80s film for a new millennium, \"Whip It\" is rough, fun, and hip-checkingly girly.",
            "Led by Ellen Page, the movie finds the Juno star playing a slightly less cocksure version of the Diablo Cody creation.",
            "Juliette Lewis and her crazy eyes pretty much make any movie better.",
            "[Whip It] treats its mostly female cast of characters with respect, and this is (sadly) a rare treat in cinema. Hannah Montana may be this generation's Spice Girl, but Bliss Cavender is the one really waving the 'girl power' flag.",
            "It doesn't reach for an epic scale but is comfortable in its humility, and that makes it all the more stellar...",
            "Barrymore is just as determined to land some insightful and unexpected dramatic punches as she is with the inherent physical comedy for which the sport is renowned.",
            "What impresses is the girl power spirit often prevalent in Barrymore's work, but also a its sense of optimism and warm heart.",
            "A surprisingly energetic, provoking and entertaining coming of age story.",
            "Slight narrative arc notwithstanding, there's a lot of warmth here."

            "The kind of small, indie flick that even mainstream audiences can love.",
            "There is a core of sadness and loneliness in Away We Go, but too often Mendes drowns those plaintive elements in bellowing yuks and overplayed comedy.",

            "[Away We Go] proves to be a warm, engaging and utterly sweet little film.",
            "The script, by husband-and-wife novelists Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida, has real heart, though, without being cloying.",

            "It's sweet, I suppose, but it's also oddly inconsequential, fake and annoying. ",
            "This mild, charmless comedy is not the provocation critics made it out to be. ",
            "It's to the actors' credit that they retain their authenticity amidst all these well-cast but cartoonishly drawn cutouts. Then again, perhaps Mendes's point was to throw Burt and Verona into relief by making everyone else a little ridiculous,",
            "I began to realize why I'd been resisting the film all along, in spite of its dogged charm. None of the places the couple visit seems remotely real. ",

            "For me, Ferrara and Keitel will always be the bad lieutenant, but Werner Herzog is probably the only director qualified to take this on, and his bizarre reboot has a fascination all of its own.",
            "Cage does bad so good. Here\u00e2(TM)s hoping he keeps the crazy coming.",
            "In fusing European experimentalism and Hollywood boldness, Herzog has created a genuine oddity, a furious and unforgettable hybrid which may well prove to be 2010's most purely enjoyable moviegoing experience.",
            "Excessive and bizarre to the point of lunacy, yet it still manages plenty of sadistic entertainment thanks to a remarkably delirious performance from Nicolas Cage.",
            "...part of the fun that Herzog seems to be having with Bad Lieutenant is calling into question \"good\" versus \"evil\" and where those lines cross and where they crumble.",

            "A work of mad genius, a deliriously entertaining journey into the darkness of the human soul that ends up, surprisingly, being one of the most hugely enjoyable films of the year.",
            "Did Nicolas Cage actually do crack for this movie? This movie makes no coherent sense, a jumble of crazy scenes...",
            "[A better grade] strictly on the merit of Nic Cage going so crazy...",
            "his movie isn't perfect.... Yet Mr. Herzog and writer William M. Finkelstein have crafted an extremely entertaining film, a genre piece that at times looks made for the art house.",

            "Bad Lieutenant invites us along for the ride, and even says 'welcome aboard' and asks: how might we entertain you today? This is Herzog and it's fun, and you don't get many of those for the pound. Get it while you can.",
            "Gritty, raw, and kooky at times, Bad Lieutenant is one of those movies that you can't really look away, even though you may want to for certain scenes.",
            "Herzog wades deep into the swampy funk of New Orleans, which in this post-Katrina setting might as well be an end-of-the-world movie. He's clearly turned on by [its] weirdness, the casual corruption, the gangsterism and the Southern Gothic outrageousnes.",
            "This movie has no focus, no point of view and nothing to say. Is this a sendup? Is this an actual thriller? Is this just a look into the soul of a drug addict? I have no idea, and I don't think Werner Herzog knows either.",
            "Sometimes a scene is a set up for a future plot twist, and sometimes Werner Herzog just wants to film some alligators. Who knows what'll happen? It's like filling your underpants with salamanders.",
            "If Herzog had chosen realism over surrealism, this film would have been predictable and unentertaining. As it is, I found it oddly captivating. This is one weird movie."

            "After a long run of baroquely plotted crime dramas like Layer Cake and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, it's a little depressing to come across a vigilante drama whose sole twist is its protagonist's advanced age.",
            "It's simply the tale of a man who decides to do something and sticks to his guns, so to speak. That the man is played by Michael Caine is what makes it worthwhile.",
            "The film is dark, beautifully half-lit and as controlled as it needs to be so Caine can work his way deeper into the character. His performance is astonishing: Harry is stooped, no longer physically strong, but he has immense reserves.",
            "Stylishly filmed in a grimy palette of putrescent green and muddy brown, the movie seems at times almost to revel in the nastiness it depicts.",
            "On one side, it's all compellingly believable; on the other, it's simply incredible. We do our best to straddle the rift but, in the end, the gulf proves too wide, the contrast too great, and a tumbling movie takes us down with it.",

            "Harry Brown might just about have got by as a tongue-in-cheek popcorn romp, but by setting itself up as a virtual state-of-the-nation address it only draws attention to its own petty, embittered vacuity.",
            "If all these aspects could be fleshed out and balanced, \"Harry Brown\" would be an excellent film. As it stands, it's an interesting look into one man's vigilantism, whose partial success is entirely do to the many talents of Michael Caine.",
            "By the end, it's turned from a geriatric Death Wish into a one-dimensional Taxi Driver...",
            "\"[Caine] elevates this grim vigilante-fest from pretty darn good to essential viewing.\"",
            "A lot to digest stylistically and narratively, but Harry Brown is developed in an ever-increasing, shock-inducing manner and is undeniably successful.",
            "Although Caine lives up to expectations in this nicely crafted (though violent) film, the oversimplified story he's given to work with keeps it from the top of Caine's impressive filmography.",
            "Harry Brown is a more meditative take on garden variety exploitation, but its attraction lies in the same guilty pleasure centers of the brain that exult in a kind of movie violence that is the very opposite of senseless. ",
            "A very good film -- albeit very violent and bloody -- and contains yet another splendid Michael Caine performance. I'm not complaining too much based on those grounds alone.",
            "Maybe Michael Caine just wanted to make his \"death wish\" before kickin' his \"bucket list.\" Say what you wanna say, but I'd rather watch old-timers bust gums than tandem parachute with Morgan Freeman while John Mayer plays softly in the background.",
            "In the hands of a lesser actor, this would feel just as clich\u00e9d as it sounds. But Caine brings his smarts as well as his baggage to the character, making him more than another mad-as-hell guy with a gun.",
            "A revenge fantasy that recalls the Charles Bronson Death Wish series and Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino, Daniel ... would be unremarkable if not for the grave, lowered gaze of Michael Caine and the relentless grittiness of its cinematography.",
            "Forget those boring, ludicrously overpriced, would-be summer blockbusters and go see the art of vigilante-movie-making done to a fare-thee-well. Caine's Harry makes bad-boy Russell Crowe's Robin Hood look like a sissy."

            "By halfway the film starts to feel like a mere exercise, one more effort to get maximum value from limited resources. Too much machinery, not enough dread.",
            "There might even be a touch of his father in there -- ''your circuit's dead, there's something wrong, can you hear me, Major Tom?'' It is a well-built, concentrated movie with a brain and a purpose.",
            "An eccentric sci-fi which cleverly deconstructs the mythology of the Star Treks and Star Wars which have colonised the future of our imaginations with their glamour, self-importance and operatic sound tracks.",
            "The film engagingly sets a cold, scarily inhumane atmosphere that is interesting but not spectacular.",
            "[A] beautifully-crafted fable about the consequences of human greed and unfettered technological endeavour that's plausible enough to be genuinely chilling.",
            "Rockwell gives a great performance in what is more or less a one-man film.",
            "Suffice it to say, Mr. Rockwell more than carries the film, with a nuanced performance that speaks volumes about the fears of alienation and corruption that always seem to accompany our literature about the future.",
            "Directed and conceived by Duncan Jones, Moon is quiet and disturbing, yet manages to be hopeful in the face of overwhelmingly grim conditions.",
            "A cue to the responsibility of filmmakers in a time when most seldom trust their audiences to think about answers, and asks questions that paralyze us in intricate fascination long after the final shot has left an imprint.",
            "Rockwell's certainly up for the challenge of playing multiple roles, but ultimately, he's just yammering to himself. This movie has half an idea and, and the end, tries to convince you it had seven.",
            "Solaris and Blade Runner meet Silent Running. A movie with both a brain and a heart. ",
            "Intriguing, imaginative, and thematically ambitious, Moon gives ample proof that Jones is a serious talent, pushing his concepts into intellectually and spiritually challenging territory.",
            "It's a film that won't fail to move or excite anyone who's ever cast their eye skywards and let themselves wonder.",
            "Sam Rockwell should have been nominated for Best Actor at least twice. ",
            "Simple and alien-free example of the sci-fi genre. Slow, but there are so many details deserving attention, the chance to take them all in one only enhances the experience.",
            "Someday, Rockwell will get his Oscar due, I have no doubt. But I bet that when that day comes, lots of movie lovers will look back and say, 'But it should have happened for Moon.'",
            "A throwback to the golden era of 1970s sci-fi, Moon is a long overdue and morally relevant antidote to the overblown bombast of todays science fiction.",
            "Moon is an old-fashioned sci-fi movie in the best sense: far more psychological drama than space opera, dispensing with overweening CGI and loud flashy action sequences while harking back to subtler, more ideas-driven entries in the genre.",
            "Evocative, riveting, and ultimately contemporary in a roundabout way, Moon is a superb mood piece, sublimely cradled by Jones, filtered through tireless work from star Sam Rockwell.",
            "While some of it is clearly inspired by other material, director Jones spins this yarn into something unique and fresh and new and exhilarating."

            "With its deft handling of teen yearning and affection, Half-Blood Prince maneuvers mysteries of heart and hankering that resound in worlds magic and Muggle.",
            "David Yates is a solid hand as director, he does nothing but let the taps run, leaving us with little more than a bath full of comfortable if lukewarm water.",
            "Simultaneously the most mature and the most entertaining; the days of playful sorcery and lighthearted misadventures are long gone.",
            "While we've always seen touches of brilliance in Radcliffe's work, the most surprising growth comes in the performances of Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. ",
            "Director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves crafted a challenging and decidedly mature film that paves the way perfectly for the two-part finale.",
            "There is an overriding sense of urgency in the penultimate film, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince which moves at breakneck speed from the opening sequence itself.",
            "Good film directed for a teenage audience in which not only is magic taught but also how stereotypes affect it while the film itself recreates some British stereotypes. [Review in Spanish]",
            "It's competently executive as a movie, but as an adaptation... it's badly done.",
            "The most mature Potter film yet, dealing with emotional issues much stronger than any previous installment, and the young cast more than steps up to the plate.",
            "While the sixth chapter in the popular series from writer J.K. Rowling has some similar problems to its predecessor, it manages to inject some much needed magic and charm back into the franchise.",
            "Since they do spend so much time on the teen hormone angle, I have to say that the Harry Potter-Ginny Weasley love story is disastrous in both book and film.",
            "With real chemistry between the characters, laugh-out-loud scenes of teen-wizard angst, and some truly spectacular cinematography, it may even be the best in the series.",
            "... reaffirms the hypothesis that the sixth Harry Potter movie only constitutes of a \"transitional\" film, between the \"little wizards\" and the \"senior wizards\" that will face Voldemort in Potter's last magical battle. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "What I liked about this one is the mystery, which is always at the heart of a Harry Potter story.",
            "Any movie that works as a spy thriller, love story, and horror movie all at once is pretty remarkable. You might say it takes a fair amount of wizardry.",
            "Mostly I love Harry Potter for the actors",
            "I thought Rupert Grint came out of this the best of all of them.",
            "Half-Blood is a sustaining visit with beloved old (if not in age) friends.",
            "The movie can never shake the feeling that it's one big set-up, a meek prelude to the thrill ride to come in Deathly Hallows.",
            "Not only is Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince an excellent translation of J.K. Rowling's addictive canon, but it's also the first entry to shine on its own devoid of its backdrop mythology."

            "When Tarantino sent this message to moviegoers in 2009, it's unlikely that he imagined how relevant it would be in 2019.",
            "The performance of Christoph Waltz, playing the Nazi Gestapo figure Col. Hans Landa, is the highlight of the film. His ability to convey courtliness and sympathy and then go to commit the cruelest of horrors is simply superb.",
            "The film might not be Tarantino's masterpiece but it is his most entertaining and exhilarating effort since Pulp Fiction.",
            "Despite the injection of content from a variety of directions, Basterds lacks the crackly excitement of Tarantino's other efforts, mainly because he can't seem to tie the whole package together.",
            "Inglourious Basterds is naughty, apocalyptic fun -- Tarantino's version of a war movie, with history rewritten to avenge the guilty in ways that satisfy his pop-art cinephilia.",
            "Waltz will be unknown to most American audiences -- he was certainly unknown to me -- but he's nothing less than sensational as the silky, polyglot SS officer charged by the Fuhrer to root out the remaining Jews in France. ",
            "Fans will find plenty to love with the ample servings of clever dialogue, a spattering of brutal violence, and a revenge story built for a truly explosive conclusion.",
            "Fortunately, in Waltz Tarantino has found an actor who carries off the script's multi-lingual wordiness with panache, while investing his character with a combination of suave menace and knowing humour.",
            "Waltz gives the film's most satisfying performance.",
            "Quentin Tarantino's unconscionably entertaining Nazi-kitsch gore fest thrusts him back into the cultural conversation...",
            "Inglorious Basterds is glorious!!!!! The film is so enjoyable, so entertaining, so smartly written, so well crafted, so beautifully lensed and so well acted that I didn't want it to end.",
            "Inglourious Basterds is bold, brazen and satisfying in the extreme.",
            "It's very, very entertaining. It's also, of course, pretty violent, and the kind of inventive, colorful violence his fans have come to know and love.",
            "...Inglourious Basterds is Tarantino's best film.",
            "Tarantino's Western-inspired fantasy acts as a real-world corrective of how the Nazis perhaps ought to be seen - with utmost scorn - and in what context this sort of cinematic violence can, and even should, be indulgent.",
            "It's clever, riotously amusing in parts, and does have some salient points to make about the relativity of the acceptance of violence.",
            "You have to respect Tarantino's vision, moral aversions or not. But the result this time feels like a great idea that ranged out of hand.",
            "A highly ambitious and highly entertaining effort that takes the war drama and crushes it to pieces -- reassembling a masterpiece that reinvents the familiar genre.",
            "However, despite the aspects that can make loving Tarantino a slog, he has moments of true cinematic greatness that cannot be ignored.",
            "It's funny. It's violent. It's funny and violent. The acting is unbelievable. Pitt is charming as the icy killer, and it's clear Tarantino has found his new muse in Laurent.",
            "It's all eye-poppingly impressive, and the relentlessness of it will still make you want it to stop as you head deep into hour three. Then after you leave, you might find you think about it a lot, how interesting it was, even the boring parts.",
            "From the opening moments (Tarantino's films always start strong), the film establishes itself as the auteur's best work.",
            "Where Death Proof kept halving itself-effectively remaking and one-upping the Kill Bill mommy saga with different drapery-Basterds keeps excoriating everything, loud and proud and begging to be heard.",
            "The movie left me both exhilarated and frustrated. Not quite a masterpiece, it might qualify as a \"messterpiece,\" an unwieldy, unfocused film with unforgettable moments that nearly get lost in a sea of excess."

            "Even for the routinely terrific Kristin Scott Thomas, the infidelity-themed Leaving is a top-drawer thesping workout.",
            "If Leaving is a romantic parable, it is a dark and depressing one, emphasizing not the sensuality of attraction but rather the obsessive side of romantic behavior. This is mad love for sure, and that is not usually a pretty picture.",
            "The only reason to see \"Leaving'' - and it's not a bad reason at all - is for the sight of Kristin Scott Thomas in a rare happy mood.",

            "Corsini tries to take an even-handed approach to each character by showing how confusion leads to selfishness, but nothing new is added to this predictable genre.",
            "Peculiarly powerful, as well as sun-drenched, which always helps.",
            "A heady, pertinent cocktail of love, mid-life crisis, and domestic abuse among the bourgeoisie, Catherine Corsini's classy, cerebral soap can feel a little schematic. Happily, KST is on hand with thespian superpowers to save the day.",
            "With a terrific central performance from Kristin Scott Thomas, Leaving is a thoroughly gripping emotional drama that plays like a sun-drenched film noir.",
            "This alternation between frenzy and calm is the key to Corsini's aesthetic, a strategy the director employs in order to both introduce a modest tension into her otherwise tired material.",
            "The fact that her children have their lives upended by their mother's yearning for Lopez's low-born, bad-boy loser makes matters both worse and more idiotic than plausible.",
            "[Thomas] remains a mesmerizing mix of carnality and class, and through richer and poorer, she keeps director/co-writer Catherine Corsini's bourgeois fantasy from overheating.",
            "Between the terrific performances and artful cinematography, this is one high-class piece of melodramatic crap.",
            "This is one of those films that depends entirely on its star, and Thomas mixes sexuality, giddy flirtatiousness, stoic determination and agony in just the right amounts, without ever straining.",
            "Thomas, bless her, remains compelling throughout. But it gets harder and harder to watch the things \"Leaving\" forces her to do.",
            "Thomas' face, tremulous with desire one second, steely with anger the next, holds the screen every second. But the actress deserves richer material.",
            "While \"Leaving\" is a tragedy, it's also a celebration: of the way a fine actor can tell us a story, barely needing words.",
            "Scott Thomas walks around in jeans and a T-shirt and has that Isabelle Huppert lifelong little girl look. She's good. Pity about the movie.",
            "Corsini's story veers close to lurid melodrama, but her star's performance is ... nakedly honest ... Suzanne risks everything for love ... Scott Thomas is equally fearless.",
            "Brutal retrato de una pasi\u00f3n arrolladora, y de un deseo de escapar casi tan inevitables como el mismo acto de vivir. Gran trabajo de Kristin Scott Thomas, quien vuelve a encontrar una inmejorable oportunidad de lucimiento en el cine franc\u00e9s.",
            "Akin to 40s-50s female-driven melodramas, we get neither James Cain noir nor Douglas Sirk's preachiness. Rather, it's a straight-ahead slog into self-destruction, a character study ... sans the study of character.",
            "Writer-director Catherine Corsini has decisively put the folle back into amour fou. Scott Thomas is not only one of the finest character actors in the English language, but in the French as well."

            "Nowhere Boy reveals the magnitude of the good women behind the grand icon.",

            "More love triangle than musical, the effective and often sweet Nowhere Boy offers a sense of the time and tension that produced John Lennon.",
            "This portrait of a Beatle as a young man also gives filmmaker Sam Taylor-Wood, working on a thoughtful script by Matt Greenhalgh, creative room to manoeuvre, introducing us to John just as he and rock 'n' roll discover one another.",
            "Nowhere Boy is a poignant reminder that before the world was at his command, John Lennon was a bit like you and me.",
            "A film of image over substance, something Lennon himself spent a lifetime rejecting. The film not only ignore that, it betrays it.",
            "The film has very few historical flaws and is a raw portrayal of John Lennon's adolescence, which adds to the flavour and makes one wish they could discover The Beatles for the first time, all over again.",
            "There's an effective timelapse montage that shows Lennon's growing musical confidence while under his mother's tutelage, framed by the ever-changing furnishings of her house.",
            "It is perfectly accomplished, and pleasing enough, but it's not going to blow your socks off, even though the combination of Ms Taylor Wood and such a compelling story would give you every reason to think it might. ",
            "Nowhere Boy should make everyone involved proud.",
            "This is a very decent effort for a first-time director, but given the auteurist expectations created by Taylor-Wood's track record in the art world, it's hard to discern a distinctively personal take on the material, or indeed the medium.",
            "Nowhere Boy ends up being a rather play-by-play biopic, saved by good performances and a great soundtrack.",
            "Given Lennon's wayward streak, Nowhere Boy is oddly safe and functional.",
            "The acting all round is pretty good, but the story itself is given to a sense of drift, as if the film itself doesn't know any better than Lennon what it wants.",
            "Fascinating...fills in a lot of blank spaces in the Beatles history we already knew.",
            "It might not have what Beatles fans are expecting from a film about the young John Lennon, but it remains an interesting portrait of the early days of the future legend and is worth seeking out.",
            "The content is there but the form is a Xerox copy of every celebrity coming-of-age tale you've heard and seen before.",
            "A passable drama, and might make a nice double feature with Backbeat.",
            "Nowhere Boy succeeds because its creators never wallow in sanctimony, keep contrivances to a minimum and has a lead actor who evolves his character rather than imitates. ",
            "Tallied up, while there are a few flashes of decent writing and some solid acting from the supporting cast, 'Nowhere Boy' lacks any cohesive tempo...",
            "...quickly decomposes into a well-made picture of the artist as a young man.",
            "Nowhere Boy goes somewhere, but it's not into art. Yoko Ono has okayed the movie, but I think John Lennon would sneer at it.",

            "Everyone who's ever seen a movie knows where this is headed... but getting there is breezy, fun, and most importantly, well-executed.",
            "An unspeakable nadir in the career of its writer-director-star, My Big Fat Greek Wedding's Nia Vardalos.",
            "All I Hate Valentine's Day adds up to is an awkward, ritualized date between moviegoer and a still-learning triple hyphenate.",
            "This movie is so poorly written, with inexplicable characters making ridiculous choices, and the dialogue is simply cringe-worthy.",
            "A big fat Greek flop!",
            "Uninspired romcom is no My Big Fat Greek Wedding.",

            "An indie romantic comedy even worse than most of the bigger-budgeted but almost invariably rotten Hollywood examples of the genre.",
            "What it lacks in laughs -- there are none -- it tries to make up for by ladling on stale clich\u00e9s, such as Vardalos' two stereotypically gay assistants and a desperate younger female friend who stalks guys.",
            "For I Hate Valentine's Day, Vardalos has chosen to direct. And that's a mistake that only compounds the ones in her screenplay.",
            "You might blame Nora Ephron, whose screenplay for When Harry Met Sally established the formula that I Hate Valentine's Day runs into the ground. Compared with this, Ms. Ephron is Chekhov.",
            "The movie is set up as a valentine to Vardalos. She should try sending herself flowers.",
            "Nia Vardalos wrote, directed and stars in this clunky, unfunny and plodding mess. She doesn't write dialogue, she writes shtick. Her direction seems awkward and amateurish, her acting is more like mugging.",
            "Given the inevitable response to this equally regrettable rom-com, she can expect to loathe Independence Day, too.",
            "Is it too pat to say I Hate This Movie? That's about the level of creative energy Vardalos applies to a film that manages to be every bit as bad as My Life in Ruins.",
            "By the time the end credits hit, there's joy emerging not from the outcome of the Genevieve/Greg romantic tango, but the feeling of relief to know the film, and Vardalos's insipid direction, has finally come to a close.",
            "Put it this way: Children who see this film at an impressionable age risk inhibiting their social growth.",
            "Vardalos calls her film \"the ultimate indie experiment,\" and if that's what is meant by ham-fisted pacing, writing, and acting, this is as ultimate and as indie as it gets.",
            "I Hate Valentine's Day is a horror show masquerading as a romantic comedy. Maybe Vardalos is just in the wrong line of work.",
            "The strength of Vardalos' movies is that she loves all of her fellow actors and allows large ensembles to flourish."

            "...an amiable and mostly funny spotlight on a part of black culture...",
            "Mr. Rock and Mr. Stilson don't beat you up with a tiresome polemic a-la Michael Moore. Never does he put himself at the center of the film, condescend to the audience, or insult his interview subjects regardless of their views...",

            "Educates more than it entertains, even though there's plenty of colorful subjects (Chris) Rock could have gently lampooned.",

            "One of [its] primary pleasures...is that, in choosing a topic as narrow and parochial as the fate of an English soccer club, Morgan has relieved himself of any duty to persuade us that the events he describes are of world-historical import.",
            "A finely constructed and fiercely entertaining soccer movie that deals more in pride and obsession than penalty kicks.",

            "It's entertaining even if you don't quite follow all of the intricacies of the game, mostly thanks to the boisterous cast.",

            "For once we have a movie in which learning humility --learning that ambition can be as self-defeating a force as laziness given faulty motivation -- is the point of the film and not some short stop on the way to a thunderous comeback.",

            "More than gets by on the strength of Coppola's ability to construct a visually arresting and compelling film even when the story and the dialogue border on uninteresting.",

            "Deeply personal yet utterly accessible, and with moments of laugh out loud humour mixed in with the Tennessee Williams-esque tension, Tetro is romanticism, comedy and drama wrapped up in one utterly sublime package.",

            "A welcome return to some kind of form for the bearded behemoth.",

            "Tetro means \"gloomy\" in Italian, and sitting through this film is depressing indeed.",
            "The movie is befuddling, but not because of plot convolutions. It keeps you at a distance when it seems singly concerned with the particular plight of the \"art family.\"",

            "Fellow players and aspiring rock gods will thrill at the scenes of the trio jamming together, but Guggenheim's film never takes an insular \"muso\" view and has plenty to offer the lay person."

            "Determining the exact level of artifice never stops being distracting, and the emotional climax is far from earned.",
            "There are so many things about the film that could have been annoying (...) but the story is so refreshing and honest that it would be almost impossible to find anything annoying here.",
            "Yi's worldview is best represented by a song she writes for Cera, a Weezer-esque bit of nerd rock called You Smell Like Christmas. At first the song is irritating, but it sticks in your head and just like Paper Heart, the song is annoyingly hummable.",
            "It's not the worst cutesy, lo-fi love story you'll ever see, but it's shown up by all those genuine true-life tales. Alongside them, its falseness is too glaring.",
            "An extremely irritating, narcissistic picture.",

            "Pulsing with incredulity and dread, it's less a fully developed argument than the seed of one.",
            "Videocracy is a fascinating film, indicative of the new wave of scorn and revulsion felt by a younger generation of Italians for Berlusconi's smug and mediocre rule.",
            "Videocracy makes spooky comedy of a nation's addiction to fame.",
            "Gandini's voiceover is a little ponderous, but, aptly for a film about the primacy of the image, he lets the pictures, many of them deliberately awkward tableaux, others bordering on absurdist, do most of the work.",
            "The combination of terrific footage with a low, rumbling score of doom makes this a compelling horror show.",
            "Videocracy is a queasy-funny and unapologetically biased look at the televisual world that the Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, has created.",
            "Less than the sum of its parts; colorful, but not quite a forceful enough inquisition into the go-go, power-grab pop intersection of fame, tabloidism and information management to connect in lasting emotional fashion.",
            "Celebrity and the PR politico",
            "Italian-born director Erik Gandini's damning mess of a documentary purports to reveal that Italy is TV- and celebrity-besotted -- which is true but not new.",
            "Sadly, filmmaker Erik Gandini misses an opportunity ... in this documentary that sets out to explore the links between Berlusconi's business interests and his political standing.",
            "This extremely clever documentary explores the power of the media through a remarkably unsettling case study: namely, Italy. Not only is the situation there pretty frightening, but it has implications for every other media-obsessed nation.",
            "Politicians of the world are the celebrity faces of multi-national global corporations that call the shots. If that's news to you then sure, go see this documentary about Italy's variety of such exploitation.",
            "A documentary that wakes us up to the pitfalls of politically controlled television and then puts us to sleep watching the people producing it.",
            "Gandini does a great job keeping his colorful subjects front and center. While he does not star oncamera like Michael Moore, Gandini's creative hand is felt throughout the film's swift 84 minutes as its English-language narrator.",
            "A chilling, cautionary expose' of Orwellian dimensions.",
            "Marginally engaging and amusing, but often lazy, meandering, unenlightening, excessively facile and underwhelming.",
            "Less an indictment than an obvious expos\u00e9, Videocracy is foreplay to larger issues, a sideshow to the larger story of Berlusconi's control of the media.",
            "If a team of clever screenwriters tried to script a cautionary tale about the politics of fame (and the fame of politics), they likely couldn't come up with anything odder or more apt than Erik Gandini's documentary Videocracy.",
            "In comparison, Jersey Shore looks like something that might appear at Lincoln Center.",
            "A stale vibe is only one of the problems pervading Erik Gandini's documentary about the pathological symbiosis between unregulated media control and celebrity mania in Italy.",
            "A fascinating film, but for every interesting idea explored, there are just as many that don't seem to have as much relevance; the film is never focused enough to be wholly effective.",
            "A stylized, scattershot inquiry into Italy's TV-dominated culture, Videocracy is a portrait of 21st-century media fascism.",
            "If you think TV significantly lowers a country's collective IQ, imagine a vast idiot box theme park nation like Italy, whose leader, Burlusconi, is also the reigning media empire mogul. A scary, ruthless extreme celebrity vision of a soulless TV culture."

            "All those tornadoes, mischievous kids, live sheep births and mating donkeys accidentally caught on film only make \"Tulpan\" more wondrous to behold.",
            "But in addition to the brutality of Tulpan's environment, and its merciless impress on the inhabitants, the film succeeds foremost, most surprisingly, as comedy. The trials and tribulations of Asa are worthy of Samuel Beckett.",

            "While it is no documentary, this lovingly made film captures a culture and a rural way of life with a mix of realism and poetry.",
            "With this harsh and beautiful backdrop so attentively rendered, at once otherworldly and palpable, the desires of Tulpan's characters become almost metaphysical imperatives.",

            "To tell you what happens to him from here would be a tremendous disservice. We'll just say that, refreshingly, nothing about it is sickly sweet.",
            "A rich and moving reminder of the way professional sports aspirations can shape someone's destiny in the real world.",
            "This is a tragic sports movie that shies away from every element of tragedy.",
            "A hopeful story, a heartwarming story, an entertaining story...",
            "Writer-directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck could have created a clich\u00e9-ridden film...But the pair (who also made the teacher drama Half Nelson), are more concerned with humanism than proving that dreams do come true.",
            "By refusing to \"win one for the Gipper\" or any of the other boring sporty standards, the directors have a lot to be proud of. By being a little bit bolder, however, they really could have hit it out of the park.",
            "Sugar is one smart, beautiful movie, and from where I stand, it is an instant classic with the guts and integrity to remain focused on a winning story about a flowering American-immigrant soul.",
            "Sugar is worth seeing not because it invalidates baseball's meritocracy, or because it makes us feel guilty for enjoying the national pastime, but because it shows us with empathy and insight how baseball players are more than what they do on the field.",
            "A raw and insightful film that will appeal to viewers who may or may not be sports fans.",
            "Sugar's personal achievement is uplifting-and it's also cause for celebration when artists create just for the love of the game.",
            "This captures many moving moments and atmospheres in the diverse settings, bu the narrative arc isn't quite as engaging as it could be.",

            "A familiarity with baseball is probably crucial to getting the most out of this quiet, absorbing drama.",

            "The cinematic equivalent of an investigative Sports Illustrated two-parter.",
            "You get the perfectly calibrated story of one young man's travels, not just to the United States from his tiny island country but to the land of expectations that come with adulthood.",
            "I've watched thousands of baseball games and seen tons of baseball movies, but Sugar opened new doors of understanding and insight.",
            "Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, the makers of Half Nelson, return with another subtly observed drama about a character on the outskirts of mainstream America.",
            "Boden and Fleck are attentive to detail and the nuances of social interaction -- in the cornfields of Middle America as well as in the Dominican Republic. And Sugar is a thorny but endearing hero.",
            "It is full of so much humor, grace, and unexpected detail, and arrives in such a truthful place, that in the end it's far more enthralling than the typical rags-to-riches tale one might have anticipated.",
            "As the film plays out its melancholy story, we realize that what we are watching is far rarer than the usual sports flick."

            "Undermined by a weak, phony-feeling ending, Cyrus Nowrasteh's film is nevertheless a pitiless study of moral cowardice."

            "An intriguing if strangely empty glimpse inside a seemingly glamorous world,",
            "This film and Grey's performance, which is unrefined but totally captivating, make almost every other easy label for a woman seem boring and inadequate. Through Grey, Soderbergh makes prettiness devastating.",
            "Documenting the way we speak now, however, doesn't compensate for the film's own hollow rhetoric; TGE's tricked-out, fractured narrative merely distracts from its dead-end cynicism. ",
            "In some ways, the movie seems pornographic, and it's because in its progression it captures, as though by accident, a certain innocence--that sort of innocence that ends up incriminating the audience.",
            "Despite the rampant symbolism that Soderbergh conjures and indulges, The Girlfriend Experience is not a cold or clinical film at all. ",

            "Given the film's timestamp and the illusory nature of Chelsea's transacted affections, she may be the Aughties bubble economy incarnate.",
            "Grey's face is mostly inexpressive, a dutiful mirror that soothes and deflects the egos she's paid to cultivate, while hiding deeper secrets. And in the mask of those impassive features, Soderbergh finds a sad world of unwitting nuance.",
            "Her beauty, independence, and stock portfolio notwithstanding, Chelsea's tale is a timely, tragic one told with typical Soderbergh finesse, a sly, sleek merger of sex, lies and hi def video.",
            "For those inclined to follow [Soderbergh] down every nook and cranny of his career, it will be a welcome reminder of how restlessly probing he can be about matters of the heart.",
            "Not that The GirlfriendExperience rises to the level of Godard's Vivre sa vie, but it does provoke a host of issues that, wisely, it makes no attempt to resolve.",

            "Grey is no grand thespian, but she's an incredible presence: Her face projects an inner confidence while also radiating a subtle but unmistakable fragility.",
            "With barely any sex on the screen, the film suggests more than it shows and, despite its small canvas, is a stylistic coup for the director's low-budget ambitions.",

            "To keep a steady gaze, the film suggests, is not just a virtue but a form of orderly protest, when your world is breaking apart.",
            "Throughout, Suleiman contemplates how much has changed in his homeland since the Israeli declaration of independence in 1948, and how the natives have tried to maintain some continuity.",
            "It is a film that through its aesthetics, I presume, achieves a very peculiar symbiosis between historical revisionism and the social and political reality of the Palestinians. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "A deeply personal film for Suleiman, as he uses his own family as a microcosm of a greater Palestinian plight.",
            "Though the film, like Suleiman's other work, is undoubtedly political, its cinematic form and content are marked by a studied yet subtle simplicity. ",

            "...a missed opportunity of nigh epic proportions...",
            "Deadpan, non-reactive characters inhabit the formally elegant, beautifully lensed and mostly static compositions that grace this movie about a hot subject that more often inspires heated, passionate, noisy debate.",
            "The Time That Remains, Elia Suleiman's six decade-spanning speculative remembrance, brings a bleakly comic sensibility -- as well as an insider's perspective -- to 60 turbulent years of Israeli-Palestinian conflict.",
            "Elia Suleiman is among the few living filmmakers to employ slapstick comedy in his work, and the only one to politicize it. ",
            "A welcome example of kitsch wedded to serious indictment: Who knew that high-school screenings of Spartacus had such insidious purpose?",

            "The formalism Suleiman employs here provides a unique emotional entry point into the Palestinian dilemma, one that uses static shot composition and humor to clarify and comment, not to generate cheap laughs.",
            "The silence of the character played by director Elia Suleiman lends the role a kind of invisibility that seems meant as an analogy to his view of the Arab presence in Israel. He's present, yet absent.",
            "Another Palestinian director dealing with the same events might rant and rave. Not Suleiman. He knows the power of well-conceived humor.",

            "Family saga set against the backdrop of Israeli occupation has its moments, but suffers from a certain monotony in its direction.",

            "Really, it's just an extension of the LeBron James brand, released to coincide with a book on the same subject and designed to explore the star's humble roots even while further buffing his galactic glitter.",
            "It drags in places, becomes repetitive and could use a more rigid hand in editing, but it also has a kind of pleasing earnestness that would be lost in a more sophisticated effort.",
            "Expertly orchestrated and unavoidably moving, More Than a Game is nevertheless your standard inspirational sports story about spunky kids who defy the odds to become champions.",
            "More Than a Game is more than a feature-length profile of LeBron James, and that's good news.",
            "The filmmakers go a little too far with the superlatives, at times trying to portray these gifted and often immature players as bigger underdogs than they appear to be in real life. But the movie is comprehensive and interesting...",
            "Like a gambler with an inside bet, you can know the final score, but still enjoy every second of the game.",
            "While not a particularly great documentary, it succeeds hugely at what it sets out to do, aided by a dramatic storyline that would probably be dismissed as too fantastically implausible if it was in a fiction film.",
            "What a cool documentary. What a cool memoir.",
            "The story itself would be largely untold if Belman hadn't wheedled his way into their trust, filming his own footage and being granted use of a wealth of home-movie material.",
            "No make-believe Hollywood script could match this once-in-a-lifetime, all-American story.",
            "There's plenty to both cheer and ponder.",
            "What's amazing, and what Belman captures perfectly, is how Coach Dru achieves his dream of becoming a head coach by being a role model to these boys in need.",
            "Despite opening with a statement that basketball should be a means to an end rather than an end in itself, the film itself is about 99.9% basketball.",
            "Utterly captivating for the humanity at its core.",
            "The film is pretty superficial in its reporting and is by-the-numbers in its storytelling. If the subjects weren't interesting, the movie would be a complete snore.",
            "What's almost as impressive as James's talent on the court is his poise and character.",
            "You'd be hard-pressed to find a better documentary about on-court dynamics and off-court camaraderie; but as journalism, it's less than thorough.",
            "Let's start with the title, which is problematic by nature: There is nothing more than a game on display here.",
            "It's especially effective in exploring the pressures on the boys and their fragile dreams.",
            "There is dazzling basketball here and an interesting father-son relationship (Coach Dru Joyce was father of the shortest player on the team).",
            "The skilled editing eventually brings out the personalities of all five players, adding an emotional stake to the footage of key games.",
            "While More Than a Game succeeds in depicting the friends' deep mutual affection, the edges of the LeBron James story are too often smoothed to a dull, inspirational point.",
            "Around the halfway point when the LeBron James crew runs into some adversity beyond the socioeconomic circumstances that get short shrift in the movie, it starts getting pretty good.",
            "Somewhat engaging and well-edited with stylish cinematography and great music, but it ultimately falls short in terms of offering insightful and provocative revelations."

            "One of the most uplifting and inspirational movies of the year.",
            "The journey of Anvil in the film is one suffused with love and passion...they are the poster-band for passion, and their story is worth checking out.",
            "What's so refreshing about 'Anvil: The Story of Anvil' is that it focuses on a Toronto band named Anvil who have been playing for 30 years despite having no commercial success to show for it.",
            "I found more real-life poetry about aspiration and failure in a fictional effort such as The Wrestler."

            "Working to a spare screenplay, Bahrani offers none of the usual clues about either the cabbie's surprising determination to prevent the tragedy or the old man's reasons for suicide. This doesn't always help the quiet drama.",
            "An endearing character piece shot through with beauty and humility in which, thanks to his leads' open, sometimes vulnerable performances, tolerance and respect take precedence.",

            "Goodbye Solo is Bahrani's best film so far, better even than Chop Shop. The images produced by Michael Simmonds, his regular cinematographer, are more definitive, more miniature.",
            "Goodbye Solo feels lived-in rather than forced upon us. Bahrani, who is his own editor, and regular DP Michael Simmonds have a sad, solitary, streetlamp-lit feel for night-shift rhythms.",

            "A modern-day, Teutonic Postman Always Rings Twice? Yes, Jerichow is just that, but minus the needed passion or suspense.",
            "Viewers will be drawn in by Jerichow even if they aren't familiar with Cain's tale and the other movies it spawned.",
            "Petzold, who has a crisp style and sharp sense of the visual, is too talented and imaginative to allow his film to become predictable.",
            "There is nonetheless something haunting about this film, a sense of desperation and defeat that seems less like a generic convention than like a genuine insight.",
            "A great modern neo-noir thriller with sparse, tight dialog and passion that boils right through to the final shocking ending.",
            "As we observe Jerichow's three main characters navigate their noirish narrative with a sense of cool detachment it becomes increasingly troubling that Petzold neglected to give us a reason to care.",
            "Jerichow's sparseness, tiny cast, and minimal plot can make the film seem a little elusive, but there's a certain elegance to Petzold's concision, too. He shows all he wants us to see."

            "It's a slice of reality hidden under a narrative veneer, illustrating the plight of Iran's muzzled arts community. That's hard-to-resist stuff, and it makes Persian Cats purr.",

            "...a well-meaning yet consistently underwhelming domestic drama that rarely packs the emotional punch that Watt has obviously intended.",
            "Testing a family for breaking points within a comic framework is not exactly new territory, but Watt's scripting is sharp and she plays fast and loose with audience expectation in the cliche department.",
            "We get to care for the characters, but would like to have understood them better.",
            "A gem of a film: a wonderfully observed snapshot that canvasses the emotional pulse of a family in the suburbs. It's the slant with which Watt affectionately embraces her characters that make it so engaging.",

            "It's [the] honest, natural performances and the way most average Aussies will relate to their sorry situation that makes My Year Without Sex all worth it."

            "I won't tell you to rush out and see it, but in these days of sequels and remakes, this was an interesting original.",

            "24 City includes evocative footage of Factory 420's dismantling, but emphasizes people over place.",
            "In [Jia Zhangke's] chronicle of the changing fortunes of a defunct but once glorious aeronautic factory and its workers through talking heads and wordless images exclusively, the documentary strain prevails to simple, yet emotionally reverberating effect.",
            "Strongest moments are when the pristine HD lensing by Hong Kong's Yu Lik-wai (a Jia regular) and Wang Yu, and warm string music by Yoshihiro Hanno, take over in montages showing the gradual dismantling of the factory.",

            "A fond, quietly ironic look at the past and the present facing the global problem of individual obsolescence and urban uprooting. ",
            "Jia purposely refrains from voicing any opinions here and its authenticity may be arguable, but if pure fiction is so often taken as historical testimony, why shouldn't half-fiction qualify for the same honours?",
            "Jia Zhangke seems to be entering a new phase of his fascinating career with 24 City, a documentary/fiction hybrid that reworks the director's signature techniques and strategies to stunning and self-critical effect.",
            "In the end, the filmmaker's fragmented approach marks an interesting, if not entirely successful, departure for one of China's most talented working directors.",
            "24 City belies its documentary origins with overtly poetic film language: the film is an elegiac visual symphony of carefully framed compositions, trompe l'oeil camera movements, posed portraits, internal rhymes and mysterious vignettes.",
            "A familiar scenario both here and in China, but Jia Zhang-ke has shaped it into a complex and lucid cinematic poem about identity, transience, and loss.",
            "History weaves in and out of faces that purl their monologues -- real or scripted -- as Jia presents the past as a giant, invisible river.",
            "An intriguing hybrid of fiction and documentary, this film chronicles the dismantling of a notorious factory in Chengdu to make way for a new luxury community. It's skilfully assembled, but a bit dry for Western audiences.",
            "Punctuated with eyebrow-raising poems about aeronautics factories, its treacle-paced obliqueness will frustrate some viewers. But the pay-off's a layered, haunting portrait of China in its shift to a capitalist economy.",
            "A deeply serious and sombre film, trying to find a way of telling the stories of people affected by the gigantic political and economic changes sweeping that country whose concerns must in the end affect us all: 21st-century China.",
            "Enthralling, beguiling and haunting.",
            "Chinese arthouse fixture Jia Zhang Ke looks at the closure of a state-owned factory in Chengdu, combining real interviews with awkwardly am-dram mock ones.",

            "Reflective historical documentary on ordinary Chinese workers.",
            "The director has an exquisite eye that keeps getting stronger and subtler. He trusts that beauty is vagueness's alluring upside.",
            "24 City won't change the minds of detractors -- it is his most painfully slow yet -- but it might change the minds of his supporters, including this critic, for Jia attempts something that is, in the end, unforgivable.",
            "As far as nonfiction goes, you probably won't seen anything else this year so beautifully filmed."

            "The most positive thing you can say about Atom Egoyan's latest film is that it is well-intentioned. But the most honest thing that you can say is that it's a painfully misguided and pretentious folly.",
            "A pretty fatuous equivalence, made much more implausible by the clotted structure, some wince-makingly unconvincing scenes and truly terrible acting.",
            "Atom Egoyan is up to his old tricks with this fractured, elusive drama, resembling but never measuring up to the ones which launched his career.",
            "Populated with rich, complex characters, Adoration's impressive array of ideas is matched by its visual beauty and narrative ingenuity.",
            "Theme is all-powerful, with characters verbally fondling their histories and identities - and, in one typically po-faced scene, intellectualising vomit.",
            "This is a real treat for fans of early Egoyan films like Next of Kin or Speaking Parts. ",
            "Adoration is a triumph, a provocative work about terror in the world and in people's hearts.",
            "Clearly fascinated by the power of new technology and the fact that anyone is able to broadcast their thoughts, Egoyan has made an engrossing movie with an intriguing, original plot.",
            "Adoration spins an intricate weave of deception, an avatar maze in which almost every character is revealed to have more than one persona.",
            "In Egoyanland it's always winter, but that can be reassuring.",
            "Uneven enigmatic social drama that's framed like an imaginative mystery story.",
            "A chilly intellectualism sucks the dramatic life out of Canadian auteur Atom Egoyan's Adoration.",
            "Though Egoyan, as usual, frequently strains credibility he at least manages to weave all of this into a fairly absorbing detective story that explores the roots and damaging implications of prejudice with unexpected grace.",
            "Without the constrictions of an adapted text, Egoyan's creativity turns towards intellectual exercise.",
            "If you can buy into the improbable, this ultimately pans out as a wise and rather poignant story.",
            "A complex, compelling brew, enhanced throughout by Egoyan's hypnotic style. Sadly, it's also weirdly remote and agonisingly slow.",
            "An ill-judged crack at a mainstream thriller.",
            "A characteristically skewed but cerebral look at a dysfunctional family in a movie much easier to admire than actually like.",
            "Egoyan has hold of serious material...but it is untidily stitched into the narrative, crushing any illusion of spontaneity and loading the dialogue with heavy-duty didacticism.",
            "But when he turns from intellectual debate to the way human beings actually speak and behave, you might feel that he'd be better off writing essays himself.",
            "Too self-conscious by half and often unnecessarily complicated. It's as if Egoyan, who wrote and produced it as well as directed, has so much on his mind that he can't sort it all out.",
            "A stylish, muddled but oddly interesting movie/moral debate, this is ultimately a reflection (I think) on post-9/11 hysteria.",
            "Seamlessly marrying the personal and the political, Adoration plots a labyrinthine course through all manner of millennial issues..."

            "This documentary is only partly a story of the chosen one; mainly, and more intriguingly, it's a chronicle of the choosing one, of the nervous young monk charged with the job of leading the search party.",
            "Films that address faith and love as eloquently as this moving 2008 documentary are rare.",
            "The film is fascinating on every level -- as a portrait of a willing servant in a complex, powerful and inscrutable religious system and a feast of spectacular sights and unusual mundane events in a corner of the world rarely exposed to prying eyes.",
            "[Director] Baratz doesn't ask any of the obvious questions, preferring to observe uncritically, and if you can do the same, you may find Unmistaken Child worth seeing. I could not, and grew restless.",
            "[Director] Baratz's access to every stage of the process -- from Zopa's selection of a candidate to the testing of that candidate to the blessing of the Dalai Lama himself -- is phenomenal, almost indescribably privileged.",
            "You could argue that the film would be stronger if it explained more fully and asked more questions, yet \"Unmistaken Child'' stands as a window on a beautiful and mysterious world. The questions it leaves hanging are for us to untangle.",
            "Visually stunning and moving religious documentary that gives the outsider a rare eyewitness report on the four-year search for the rebirth of a Tibetan lama in Nepal.",
            "Along the way, we are treated to a tour of spiritual belief, Buddhist ceremony and rural life in this remote region.",
            "How far can an incredibly cute kid and an incredibly beautiful setting go toward making a movie worthwhile? Not far enough, as indicated by Unmistaken Child.",
            "At once a compelling story and a meditative experience -- not something you'll find in Hollywood karma.",
            "Even atheists may find their world rocked by Nati Baratz's Unmistaken Child.",
            "Who knew reincarnation could be such a lovely snooze?",
            "Baratz's work may not be the slickest, but he took a risk and followed through under arduous conditions to let an audience share in a mystical journey. The film itself is an act of faith.",
            "Adorable, moving, bewildering, sad and, ultimately, peaceful.",
            "A compelling documentary about events that followed the 2001 death of the revered Tibetan master Geshe Lama Kochog.",
            "A rare, intimate look at Tibetan Buddhists' search for the reincarnation of a deceased Lama, this beautifully filmed documetary is an extraordinary spiritual travelog, with all the dramatic elements of an exotic, enthralling fantasy",
            "A most intimate look at the recognition of a peasant child as a prophet. A masterpiece of understatement.",
            "Its privileged glimpse deep into unfamiliar spiritual territory has the strength of revelation.",
            "Unmistaken Child stands above most others in offering us an intimate look at Tibetan Buddhism in action, with no external commentary or narration.",
            "Baratz's apparent willingness to accept everything at face value papers over some of the more troubling aspects of Tenzin's mission, but Unmistaken Child allows the mysteries of the process to be preserved without judgment.",
            "The story unfolds in Israeli director Nati Baratz's intriguing, beautifully filmed documentary Unmistaken Child, which records Tenzin Zopa's search and its aftermath.",
            "The documentary stands as a visually candid and picturesque peek into one of the world's most mysterious practices.",
            "The movie is a drama of faith, a Tibetan monk's search for the reincarnation of his beloved master Lama Konchog."

            "In a word: awful.",
            "Keaton the director wisely draws a leaf from Clint Eastwood's book. Keeping the framing neat, his style is the kind of unobtrusive classical filmmaking that is a dying breed in contemporary Hollywood.",
            "We are never quite sure whether this is a thriller or a dark romance, but Keaton conjures up some excellent scenes and allows Macdonald the chance to shine.",
            "An impressive piece for veteran actor Michael Keaton's directorial debut.",
            "It's a low-key film, sustained primarily through MacDonald's sweet, earnest performance and Keaton's stillness. ",
            "The real star of this picture is MacDonald, whose range draws you in and makes you care about what's happening.",
            "Miss Macdonald is an underrated actress, and she easily carries off the difficult task of being reticent but telling us everything.",
            "It is a slow film, which could work, if it eventually became intriguing, but all we get is a showcase for annoying people who would have nothing in their lives, if they weren't already in a movie.",

            "The only merriment that The Merry Gentleman delivers is through Michael Keaton's masterful direction and the performances of the two leads. It's perfectly watchable, but the story lacks the content and incident to deliver an emotional punch.",
            "Part tastefully muted, part plain morose, Keaton's direction styles this as a character study of hearts in winter. But it doesn't wash.",
            "MacDonald's perky performance is a distinct plus, especially because Keaton's character is so enigmatic he's unfathomable, while the movie's lack of pace is only partly offset by some very subtle camerawork.",

            "Director Haim Tabakman conjures up the sad mood very skilfully, with natural lighting, measured pace and an unexpected electronic soundtrack. In fact, it's probably my favourite film about the romantic love between two Jewish guys since Superbad.",

            "... worth catching for its awesome views of B.B. King (\"The Thrill is Gone\") and soul daddy James Brown in the time capsule of 1974 Zaire.",
            "Soul Power is a window into a time when anything seemed possible.",
            "B.B. King. Bill Withers. Miriam Makeba. Celia Cruz. And James Brown, earning every inch of the title, \"Godfather of Soul,\" who all by himself probably deforested a few acres around Kinshasa with the volcanic blast of his set.",
            "Does its part to widen this historic concert's potential audience base.",

            "The performances are fine, but this feels like a companion piece to 'When We Were Kings' rather than a work that can stand on its own...",
            "Soul Power leaves you wanting more, and not in a good way.",
            "It's best seen as a breezy entertainment and a reminder of how potent some of these performers -- many of whom are dead -- were in their primes.",
            "Ultimately it's the music that makes this film a cause for celebration -- especially the chance to see 'Soul Brother #1' James Brown and his blistering band perform at their absolute prime.",

            "The movie is crisp and quick and looks as if it were shot yesterday, but for all that, Soul Power is ultimately disappointing.",

            "Some may complain about the lack of contextualizing material but what is on the screen is so exciting and energetic that most viewers will probably be too busy tapping their feet and swaying their heads to the beats on display to notice or care."

            "This documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi could have used more music for my taste, and fewer talking heads. But it's absorbing all the same. N'Dour is the sort of humanitarian bridge that we need in a world so sharply divided.",

            "We in the West are afforded songs from Africa's most celebrated singer, a man with not only great pipes but with a soulful message of peace and tolerance."

            "Each of the half-dozen or so thinkers gets around 20 minutes to maunder on - simultaneously not long enough and far too long. Frustratingly, no subject is investigated in depth, and the glibness is dull.",
            "This is an addictive and stimulating experience all round.",
            "Eccentric but always accessible, Taylor's boff-doc avoids the idiosyncrasy that her work has previously exhibited. In bringing philosophy into the real world, Examined Life is at once illuminating and intellectually stimulating.",
            "Taylor's stimulating film, enlivened by creative location shooting, will surely find an appreciative audience among highbrow cinephiles.",
            "An unusual and compelling documentary featuring eight thinkers musing on philosophical matters as they walk in creative places.",
            "For those interested in seeing philosophers on the screen, this engaging movie offers the opportunity to see eight of them walking the streets.",
            "The ones that work, Cornel West and Peter Singer for example, are intriguing and compelling but they don't all hang together so effortlessly.",
            "A fascinating introduction to the big issues in modern philosophy, presented with a pleasantly light touch.",
            "A film that can haunt you for the rest of your life.",
            "Although a sporadically stimulating and thoroughly challenging exercise, Examined Life too often feels like a forum for brainy big-thinkers' annoying penchant for being as inscrutable as possible.",
            "Director-writer Astra Taylor wisely avoids turning this talk fest into a talking heads fest by filming these effusive intellectuals in a variety of visually diverting, real-world environments.",
            "Yes, examining philosophy for the greater effect it can have is admiral but it seems to get lost as the film jumps from one personality to another.",
            "There's plenty of food for thought here, though the movie is more a buffet than a meal.",
            "To [director Astra] Taylor's credit it's as inviting and accessible as a smart conversation with fascinating friends.",
            "She gives eight thinkers 10 minutes each to unload on tough topics like the meaning of life and right and wrong and comes up mostly with a lot of platitudes about treating other people nice.",
            "Watching \"Examined Life\" is sort of like sitting on a plane next to a total stranger who insists on making conversation. Except this is that one time out of 100 when the stranger turns out to be a completely fascinating person.",
            "Illuminating, even moving.",
            "In Examined Life, a lively assembly of philosophers ponder the question: \"What's at stake here?\"",
            "Endlessly thought-provoking at every turn, this iconoclastic documentary offers the opportunity for a transcendental experience amounting to this critic's most satisfying cinematic experience of 2009 thus far.",
            "Taylor introduces a degree of playfulness and unpredictability that becomes the movie's M.O."

            "If Fleck weren't such a gracious soul chasing the spirit of Sankofa, this could have been an exercise in exploitation of Graceland-ian proportions. But that's hardly the case on his magical musical mystery tour.",

            "Although Shulman died after Visual Acoustics was completed, this stylish film reminds us that great images endure after bodies and buildings crumble.",

            "Visual Acoustics is nominally about the life and career of landmark Southern California architectural photographer Julius Shulman, but it's more about the buildings he photographed than it is about him. Which is probably the way he'd like it.",

            "Andrew Bujalski ought to be more than a critical darling by this point.",

            "Beeswax can be summed up by one lingering shot, where the camera focuses, for no particular reason, on Maggie Hatcher's armpit hair. Like armpit hair, Beeswax is sweaty, unpleasant, in need of cutting, and without a point.",

            "It's rambling, doesn't really go anywhere, and is not necessarily about anything beyond its own sense of place. But it's mildly diverting nonetheless. It's about mood, not plot.",
            "Makes up in depth for what it sacrifices in breadth.",
            "Provides no interesting challenges for its characters or profound thoughts about life.",

            "Faced with the unenviable choice between honoring his daunting inspiration and telling his own story, the director shoots straight down the middle -- and misses both targets.",

            "I worry that this film is static enough and stiff enough that it's going to keep people away from discovering David Foster Wallace if they haven't read him.",
            "Tthough this experiment doesn't quite succeed, there's enough intelligence and insight in this movie to make it worth the attempt.",
            "[Krasinski's] generosity of intent is really the main impression that remains. He read, he loved, and unfortunately, he did not conquer.",
            "Actor John Krasinski deserves credit for having the ambition to adapt material as difficult as David Foster Wallace's short stories.",
            "The urgency of the tales gets lost along the way, weighed down by staginess and an inconsistent tone, although Krasinski's ambition suggests a noble failure.",
            "[Brief Interviews] is within the limits of the medium, a rigorous record of the process of thought. ",
            "...far more successful as an actor's showcase than as a fully-realized movie...",
            "Intense look at gender and relationships is best for adults.",
            "John Krasinski takes a distinct, deliberate step away from romantic comedies for a darkly comic look at human interaction.",
            "Everywhere this poor lady tries to go, there's always a guy or two loudly performing a David Foster Wallace monologue within earshot.",
            "Painfully pretentious and shallow.",
            "Krasinski re-creates the interviews using Wallace's original, but this isn't exactly a letter-of-the-law adaptation -- he tightens the interviews and defangs some of the language.",
            "The place where consciousness runs into itself is where this author reigned supreme, and Krasinski brings Wallace's concentric, self-aware ironies to the screen.",
            "The movie provides more questions than answers.",
            "A haunting exploration into men's minds that becomes too much of a psychological study to qualify as accessible entertainment for most.",
            "Too awkward, disjointed and bland while lacking dramatic momentum and true insight.",
            "Krasinski literalizes Wallace's stylistic love of asides too much, but it helps that he's aware enough of his movie's limitations to keep Brief Interviews blessedly short.",
            "Everyone speaks in the sweatily polysyllabic, Look-at-This-Writing-I'm-Doing tone that makes a page of Wallace pass like an hour on the treadmill, and the men are dopes or creeps.",
            "The Penis Monologues!",
            "It's an undeniably ambitious, if uneven, effort. Some of Krasinski's directorial flourishes are inspired, such as Christopher Meloni's imaginative re-telling (and offbeat re-enacting) about a woman he met as she stood crying at the airport.",
            "Compacted into an 80-minute mishmash of interviews, confessions and sketches, melded into a shaky mosaic, the answers from a cross section of men are shallow, self-serving and ultimately unenlightening.",
            "Flawed and uncertain and occasionally too mannered, yes, but it is also funny and unorthodox and sharp as a razor. "

            "For large portions of Law Abiding Citizen we're not sure who is going to be the winner here, nor who we want to be, and though it won't make for much of a date flick, as far as intelligent action flicks go, it gets two big burly thumbs up.",
            "While Law Abiding Citizen is in no sense a successful work of art, a film that offers the illicit thrill of cheering on an all-American terrorist is at least pursuing something more complex than ''moral clarity''.",
            "Bloodshed and torture abound in this sadistic thriller with pretensions.",
            "The film's entertainment value resides almost entirely in the ingenuity of Butler's modus operandi; but this is cancelled out by the film's underlying stupidity.",
            "Sadly, there's nothing here but bloody off-cuts from 'Death Wish', 'Saw' and 'The Silence of the Lambs', in roughly that order.",
            "Full of incoherent, spitting rage, ignorant, paranoid violence and a complete lack of internal logic.",
            "Offers plenty of entertainment value, provided that viewers are willing to accept several remarkably convenient truths.",
            "The perfect action flick for low-maintenance audiences.",
            "As a piece of fluffy entertainment, Law Abiding Citizen is passable enough; try to dig any deeper, however, and you'd be scraping the bottom of a very shallow barrel. ",
            "There were surprises, twists and turns and could get graphic at times, but overall the movie was fast-paced, well performed, and kept your attention until the very end.",
            "Law Abiding Citizen may be the most nihilistic movie I've ever seen.",
            "It's exactly the kind of film the phrase 'by-the-numbers' was invented for, but like the best genre films, it acknowledges its niche and goes all out to top its predecessors. ",
            "One of the more repugnant examples of Hollywood's cheap-thrill approach to violence, its voyeuristic brutality is matched only by its innate stupidity.",
            "The film can't seem to make up its mind whether it wants to be an audience pleasing popcorn treat or a serious, political thriller. It ends up being partly both... with varying degrees of success.",
            "Putting aside the ideological posturing, this hyper-violent fantasy about a seemingly unstoppable killer who continues his murder spree behind bars delivers on its promise of an intriguing mystery, however far-fetched.",
            "While one man's terrorist may be another's freedom fighter, it's not quite as simple when it comes to CIA operatives and your basic serial killer. Or rather, a CIA psycho family man that might make Jack The Ripper envious.",
            "The diverting garbage that is Law Abiding Citizen would be more deplorable if it were possible to take this wholly implausible film seriously.",
            "A high-octane, high body-count thriller posing the question, how do you stop a psycho vigilante on a killing spree? Apparently, by any means necessary.\"",
            "An entertaining thrill ride but not much more.",
            "In another time and place, Law Abiding Citizen could have been an intelligent critique of a flawed criminal justice system. Instead, I present you Gerard Butler, ruthlessly hacking a guy into 25 little pieces.",
            "The screenplay mashes up its elements and develops as a hairbrained plot without enough character substanc",
            "On a side note, can you believe the Oscar-winning star of RAY made a crack about Helen Keller?",
            "What sours F Gary Gray's film is the drawn-out sadism of its violence - a depressing case of torture-porn methods infecting another genre."

            "Though minor arcs play out in each piece, Dare lacks an overarching narrative to propel the entire film, so overall pacing feels uneven and long at just 90 minutes.",
            "Brind's screenplay is pregnant with fascinating questions of identity and social anxiety. And Salky knows how to create a mood.",
            "The film lacks the comedic charm of American Pie, but with its dark, hyper-sexualization of teens, it offers an engrossing if not soap opera-esque tale of self-discovery.",
            "Dare feels a bit unfinished, at once overreaching and underrealized. But there is a lot of intelligence, and considerable daring, in the basic conceit.",
            "Dare is a high school coming-of-age film that dares to push the envelope. It doesn't always succeed, but that's not for lack of trying.",
            "It is so fresh and fun.",
            "I've rarely seen a more rabidly inconsistent film -- astute one moment, stupid the next.",
            "Dare portrays teenagers with actual depth, breaking away from the conventional stories we see so often in films involving high schoolers these days. It'll stick with you long after the movie's over.",
            "The movie has already made two fatal mistakes from which it has not recovered.",
            "Dare is ostensibly about high-school identity and and social anxiety, but if feels more like three interrelated episodes of Extreme Makeover: Personality Edition strung together to make an all too obvious point.",
            "Unlike so many films that paint a rosy picture of adolescence for adults with fuzzy memories, Dare has the courage of its convictions.",
            "Quite good in brief stretches but not distinguishable enough overall, freshman director Adam Salky's picture evinces the coming of age confusion he's chronicling.",

            "Adam Salky's high-school soap offers a virtual Spumoni of caricatured adolescent hand-wringing. When subtlety equals a drama-class performance of A Streetcar Named Desire's rape scene, expect a bumpy ride.",

            "Gold attempts to show Power as a \"Napoleon Dynamite\"-like charmer, but Gold's spastic performance induces more cringes than smiles.",
            "The film's penchant for dorky nostalgia -- especially '70s and '80s-era music -- quickly becomes irritating. It deserves a real tongue-lashing for trying to re-introduce the inexplicable Mr. Mister hit \"Kyrie\" into the American consciousness.",
            "For all the cheap shots in Gold's script, Adventures of Power views air-drumming with a surprising affection.",
            "The playful plot with go-figure ending is bubbly, and the mechanics of the film are on-point for the most part.",
            "Underdog comedy is no Napoleon Dynamite.",

            "Forgive the film its Napoleon Dynamite overquirk; a loving god is watching all, genuflected to on bedroom-wall posters and seen in the film's final five minutes -- and if you're not a Rush fan, this is not your movie.",
            "The film -- despite some successful goofs and a defiantly dorky Phil Collins tribute -- can't quite win for trying.",

            "Like Diogenes with his lamp, director Yoav Shamir goes in search of anti-Semitism. This film goes further than any ever made in demonstrating that the Holocaust has been used cynically to justify Israeli expansionism and brutality.",
            "Shamir's breezy manner and casual approach encourage people to speak candidly, and their comments about Jews are shocking -- horrendous, really, but sometimes surprisingly funny.",
            "Meet Yoav Shamir -- the Israeli Michael Moore, who marches through the power centers of the U.S. and his homeland to challenge the religious orthodoxy.",

            "It's just really surprising and different and unique.",
            "It pitches the increasingly creepy dynamic that defines its fantasy world at a level that does not condescend to its children audience, nor seem too diluted for its adult audience.",
            "Entertaining, funny and surprisingly suspenseful a times, Coraline is the perfect movie for your little one...and for the child in all of us.",
            "Having read Neil Gaiman's novella a number of times, I had my own idea of what the little girl who discovers an alternative and terrifying other world in her own home should be like but director Henry Selick's vision knocks spots off my own.",
            "Coraline is an interesting film that leaves its audience with two thoughts. Normal life is perfect, even when it isn't, and beware of dreams with fangs.",
            "... a gorgeous and imaginative storybook fantasy with nightmare echoes. Think Dr. Seuss by way of Edward Gorey ...",
            "For all its shortcomings, Coraline nevertheless has more imagination, heart and inventiveness in it than most recent animated films.",
            "You know from the very first sequence that Coraline is an extraordinary movie that is going to rattle the bejeezus out of young audience members and -- the truth be told -- their fathers as well.",
            "It would be difficult for any filmmaker to mimic Gaiman's seductively amusing and imaginative writing, and Selick, who also wrote the script, should be commended for not falling back on some golden-tongued narrator. But his Coraline could use more spunk.",
            "The movie, though, dares not go below the surface. Could the problem be its use of 3-D? Did the filmmakers think that to offset this additional, illusory visual dimension they had to remove all depth from the story itself?",
            "It's the stop-motion figures themselves who steal the show. They're so vivid and expressive, in both body and facial movements, that they cease being mere puppets and take on a life all their own.",
            "The fine details and surreal flourishes Selick lavishes upon Coraline's tentative travels into the unknown are a never-ending delight. Even during the sections of the story that are intended to disturb."

            "Mostly strong, that is, with the major exception of Tom Guiry's portrayal of Joe Jr. Painfully broad, Guiry practically sinks the film with garishly slack-jawed and over-the-top manchildishness.",

            "An extremely awkward cross between Ocean's Eleven and Rain Man.",
            "A nicely photographed, mostly satisfying look at a gang of East Coast sharps and how they part marks from their money.",
            "[Director] Celestino steers clear of the can't-miss pulp thriller that Yonkers Joe could've been, and goes for broke by giving it big dollop of schmaltz. His horse doesn't come in, but it runs a respectable race.",
            "It's far from a natural, but somehow, some way, it makes its point.",
            "Celestino's bid to wrap everything up in tidy fashion feels at odds with the grittiness of the film's first two-thirds, but in the end, the movie's glimpse into a seldom-seen slice of life sticks with you.",
            "Palminteri helps the film earn very slight passing marks, if only mostly because it's interesting to see these old operators have to adapt their schemes for new times.",
            "A very well-made and well-acted film, with a very touching story about fathers, sons, and the difficulties of raising special needs kids.",
            "The parts of Yonkers Joe that have to do with gambling are fun; unfortunately, they make up only half the movie.",
            "The typecast actor breaks out of his comfort zone.",
            "Yonkers Joe is like a so-so trip to Vegas, one where you lose as much as you gain gambling. In other words, it's not the trip you're most likely to tell your friends about.",
            "Heartfelt, well-acted but overly sincere drama of a smalltime hustler and the 20-year-old Down's syndrome son he's barely known.",
            "For all its attention to detail, Yonkers Joe isn't half as tough as it pretends to be. The real story of these bottom-feeders and the sad young man they exploit is a lot uglier than the movie even begins to let on.",
            "If you can watch Yonkers Joe without thinking it's a mild Rain Man rip-off, you'll enjoy a film that could have been plagued with plot issues, but rises above it",
            "Lahti burns through a thinly written role with a surprising level of warmth and humanity, and Guiry is at times repellently convincing as a kid genetically incapable of either nuance or fakery.",
            "There's great potential to be a classic Vegas indie drama ala Swingers or The Cooler though it's only 60% its way to getting there.",
            "Yonkers Joe confirms that writer-director Robert Celestin knows his way around a local cash-stakes game of craps. It also proves, unfortunately, that his scripting skills need substantial honing.",
            "While Celestino doesn't roll snake eyes exactly, Yonkers Joe could have prospered if the filmmaker had worried more about keeping the dice hot and had let viewers' hearts warm naturally.",
            "A sweet and tidy neo-noir underworld thriller with a heart, thanks to excellent performances by the lead trio and a great setting in the seedy underworld of gambling con-artists."

            "Well and truly aimed at kids, Planet 51 is a film they will thoroughly enjoy yet which any accompanying adult will have lots of laughs in too.",
            "Just how much of this will be appreciated by children is questionable, but the film is clearly intended to keep them happy with lashings of colour, movement and cheesy jokes while older, diehard geeks can enjoy all the reference spotting.",
            "There's enough of a storyline here to keep younger space cadets moderately settled.",
            "A hideously annoying and emotionally blank tale.",
            "It could have added up to something. Alas, any excitement is submerged by the relentless barrage of trite sci-fi allusions and nudge-nudge gags aimed solely at adults.",
            "Good fun if you can put up with the pastel colours and plasticky textures, which show that in modern fantasy animation all that pixellates isn't Pixar.",
            "Shoots for the stars but still manages to end up going nowhere.",
            "The animation itself is beautiful to behold.",
            "Planet 51 is no instant classic, but it does rate as a pleasant diversion, a kind of bridge on connecting holiday blockbusters with movies you can take the kids to.",
            "A poorly animated, poorly conceived, utterly predictable science fiction adventure without a single shred of originality.",
            "So inane that not only is adult enjoyment unattainable, even younger audiences will be on to its lack of intelligence and novelty. ",
            "\"A poorly conceived comedy spotlighting a collection of anal-centric humor that's about as appealing as baseball bat to the face.\"",
            "In terms of animation, Planet 51 is out of this world. Then there's the story and the characters, which are about as dull as a dirty penny.",
            "A short-sighted assembly of sci-fi references and scatalogical humor that should nonetheless placate undemanding tots ... for ninety minutes or so.",
            "Nothing really gels and Planet 51 just comes across as shrill, rushed and unfunny.",
            "While certainly diverting, its overly frantic attempts at humour, pointless homages to other films and lack of charm mean it falls some way short. It's not terrible but neither is it memorable.",
            "A charming spoof of cold-war alien paranoia, this is visually inventive and full of action, but could do with more humour.",
            "A thin joke becomes attenuated to breaking point.",
            "Funny and well designed, but doesn't live up to potential due to uninspired dialogue and heavy hand of marketing.",
            "The screenplay aims wide for every snappy, pop-culture joke that can possibly be cracked. But the viewer's funnybone remains an elusive target."

            "Appreciation of the film relies more on the performances than the problem-solving, and Rapace delivers a complicated and deliciously contrary performance that tattoos Lisbeth Salander straight onto the brain.",

            "The story has all the makings of a ripping crime thriller. ",
            "The film is certainly faithful to every detail of the novel's intricate plot, which is fair enough, but does give it the feel of a plodding TV whodunit rather than a cinematic experience.",

            "At a scant 80 minutes, Zombieland flies by but still manages to pack in more thrills and laughs than about 10 movies.",

            "Woody Harrelson... is at his peak in this clever, fast-paced zom-com.",
            "They said zombie romance couldn't be done, but new gorecom Zombieland proves it can. And it's not sappy romance either - it delivers the angsty, twitchy, hyperverbal courtship style of the geek generation.",

            "'Where the Wild Things Are' stands out for its unusually potent evocation of the timbre of childhood imagining, with its combination of the outr\u00e9 and the banal, grand schemes jumbled up with delicate feelings and the urge to smash things up.",
            "It's all very charming and quirky... But it's also, ultimately, a little flimsy and unlikely to achieve anything like the iconic status of its source material.",

            "Loud, narcotised, emotionally stunted, it's so eager to avoid the horrors of mainstream commodity culture that it concocts a defensive version of pre-adulthood.",
            "It moves smoothly from the sublime to the ridiculous, it inhabits the dual worlds of fantasy and reality, and articulates something profoundly simple about both.",

            "It's a brilliant film in how it gives our character an opportunity to confront himself and his mother and realize they are both imperfect but trying. ",
            "This isn't just an adaptation of a beloved children's book-it's a reworking of the story that captures the essence of the thing and blows it out in a way that's both unexpected and familiar.",
            "The emotional departure Max finally takes from the Wild Things almost redeems the rest of the film in its wordless anguish. Yet, for all that, it still doesn't have the charm of the brief original.",
            "The advantage of adapting Maurice Sendak's slim tome is that there is plenty of scope for interpretation; however, for the first time in his career, Jonze comes up short in the imagination department.",
            "Jonze isn't always successful in his sometimes-esoteric interpretation of the book. But his attempt shows that he has sensitivity to the smaller dramas of the human experience.",
            "It's a quiet reminder of the power of scary-ish stories, and it's made with warmth, humor, and wisdom.",
            "It is bewildering but not in an emotionally complex or troublesome way. It's bewildering in a narratively confused, narratively lost, we-never-figured-out-what-we-wanted-all-this-extra-stuff-to-add-up-to sort of way.",

            "Spike Jonze's film adaptation of Sendak's beloved 1963 picture book, Where the Wild Things Are, evokes that state of being, of creative and destructive feelings undiluted and sometimes unchecked.",
            "It's gorgeous but slow in parts.",
            "Unnecessarily gloomy and emotionally convoluted, Spike Jonze and Dave Eggers' script for Where the Wild Things Are is a melancholy adaptation of the one-two punch that is the heavily illustrated, scantly written book by Maurice Sendak. ",
            "Does leave a lingering impression--but more due to the nagging feeling that it never quite connects than to Jonze actually meeting his grandiose thematic ambitions.",

            "We all know where the film is heading, but that's hardly the point. Rudd and Segel are such entertaining guides you're willing to follow them anywhere."

            "At times I hated it for pushing my buttons so relentlessly and with such obvious touches, but I can't deny it: I found it entertaining as hell.",
            "Shamelessly resurrecting ancient horror standbys -- not just curses; seers and s\u00e9ances, too -- Raimi clearly enjoys being allowed to return to the unruly instincts of his Evil Dead trilog",

            "Playful and relentlessly scary.",
            "Raimi's return to Evil Dead territory is proof that, respectability be damned, he can still whip up a slapstick splatterfest -- albeit a PG-13 one -- when the mood strikes.",
            "It's also refreshing to see a strong female lead character, even though it's not uncommon to find women at the forefront of gross-out horror pictures.",

            "Drag Me To Hell is pure horror heaven.",
            "There is nothing in here that resonates.",
            "It is a horror story as the most frightening cautionary tale, one that applies to all of us.",
            "Raimi, the man behind the Evil Dead movies, has always had a twisted eye when it comes to horror. Thankfully, he brings that approach to this project - creating a film that features as many laughs as it does scary moment.",
            "Ironically, it's a masterpiece of the modern horror genre. it shows a lot of cinematic strength, and it's a surprisingly meaningful movie.",
            "Drag Me to Hell can have you tense and on the edge of your seat before repulsing you with a gross out moment and then use that revulsion to lead into a gag inspired by the Three Stooges.",
            "The premise is old-fashioned-a gypsy curse haunts a young woman-but the execution is glorious, as funny and cockeyed as it is gasp-inducing. ",
            "Ultimately, what I find most endearing about the film is the same thing that I primarily love about the first two Evil Dead films: it's made by a guy who isn't afraid to let his warring sensibilities go up on display in a single film. ",
            "At what point does gleeful cynicism become so gleeful that it ceases to function as cynicism at all, and mutates into a blatant formalist trope of little emotional or intellectual resonance, but plenty of aesthetic...what's the word? Bliss?",

            "The Victorian sets are terrific and the performances of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law, both consummate actors with a special style, are excellent. Nevertheless, their performances are not enough to compensate for a less than stellar script.",
            " Despite a few laggard moments of slow going, Ritchie has pulled off an entertaining coup in giving us a Holmes for the 21st century by digging back to the 19th century original and adding a few bells and whistles.",
            "It's everything you want from a family holiday movie, but not worthy of the world's greatest detective.",
            "What was the thinking behind all this?",
            "It's all knotted together, then unraveled with brio, by Holmes and Watson. There are fisticuffs galore, fiery combustion aplenty, and, yes, my dear reader, clever deduction.",
            "The very idea of handing him over to professional lad Guy Ritchie, to be played as a punch-throwing quipster by Robert Downey Jr., is so profoundly stupid one can only step back in dismay.",
            "This over-modernized version of the detective retains the 1800s London backdrop, but little else feels familiar.",
            "Downey Jr is a delight, giving his Holmes an impish sense of mischief and proving unexpectedly nimble in the bouts of bare-knuckle, bare-chested boxing that Ritchie shoehorns into the story (now, that isn't a surprise).",
            "Downey, Jr. is the perfect casting choice who manages to bring a somewhat lackluster script to life.",
            "Too much of an action adventure story so it loses what makes Sherlock Holmes entertaining",
            "There's not only a whole lot of bone-crunching and rib-busting that Holmes joyously indulges in, there's his perpetual grubby look, his overnight stubble, stained shirt and dissolute, world-weary attitude that totally reinvents the character.",
            "For although this modern Sherlock may be popcorn friendly it is, in essence, a by-the-numbers action movie with misplaced literary pretensions that will leave fans of the novel cold.",
            "Watch it, by all means, for a dazzling visual feast, but be warned, this Sherlock is more show than tell.",
            "mostly forgettable",
            "The '09 model Holmes is at once a fresh reinvention of the concept for modern sensibilities, and a surprisingly grounded embrace of its pulpy roots. ",
            "This film seems like a cynical moneymaker, using a storied name to draw attention while not even trying to bring that beloved creation to life. Expect more of the same, though.",
            "A bravely bonkers action thriller with a crazed comic edge from director Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels).",
            "No doubt Downey's own struggles have informed his character choices. The plot is intelligent and the acting is brilliant. I didn't want it to end.",
            "As Watson, Jude Law has found his perfect role.",
            "It hardly seems worth analyzing a plot so frivolous, but its basis is a wholly material worldview.",
            "[The director's] style works well with the script, which is, while perhaps not the most engaging story, interesting and fun enough to sustain the film.",
            "As for the film itself, in true Guy Ritchie style is was all over the place with the craziness. But if you can set aside your image of Boyle's Sherlock, you may enjoy this a little more.",
            "There's plenty of fun and entertainment to be had from Guy Ritchie's take on the character for both fans of Doyle's work and for those just getting to know Holmes and Watson."

            "Too silly to be smart, too timid to be subversive about religion - it's hard to believe it's directed and co-written by the once great Harold Ramis",
            "This gambit is a catastrophic failure. Cera's loveable puppy-dog schtick is already tired, and Black can no longer carry a dud with likeability and energy alone. As for Ramis, well, perhaps he's not the Messiah after all.",

            "Unfortunately, all the talent doesn't translate on the screen. Sure, there are a few mildly amusing moments (most coming courtesy of Cera), but for the most part Year One was one big dud.",
            "Considering Year One is likely to flop, there's little point in giving it the benefit of controversy by protesting too much.",

            "Stretched painfully thin to feature length, it's a concept that's gestated for 34 years but hasn't evolved a microbe. It also proves that the Harold Ramis of '09 has nothing on the Harold Ramis of '75. ",
            "Dudley Moore once made a pretty forgettable comedy giving various well-worn bible stories a light irony wash by reacting to them with the skepticism and confusion a person of today might. Year One is basically that, but dumber.",
            "From its ill-concieved concept to its timing-free chemistry and embarrassingly-bad characterisations, Year One is a major misfire in every respect.",
            "a lazy excrescence of a film. Crude, sloppy, flat, and singularly uninspired, its only redeeming virtue is proving that Michael Cera is capable of rising above even this abominable material",
            "Only big fans of Cera and Black need catch this film, and even then, it's far from a must-see.",
            "What's even more depressing than the never-ending stream of sub-sixth-grade toilet humor is the sad fact that Year One is helmed and co-produced by two of the best laughmeisters in the business.",

            " It's a noisy ride and what you're looking at is pure hokum but for non-believers like me, there's more fun to be had from this express tour of Brown's obsessions than there was in The Da Vinci Code's ponderous progress.",

            "Angels & Demons is housewife-targeted holiday read nonsense, given a Hollywood spit 'n' shine and go-faster stripes by a once-burned, twice-shy director desperate to make amends. ",
            "In many respects, Angels & Demons is a pretty straightforward terrorist-hostage film.",
            "If The Da Vinci Code was characterized by people sitting at tables and talking, then this sequel-set film of the prequel book is characterized by people walking briskly and talking.",

            "If there were a low point of viral movie marketing last decade, consider \"The Fourth Kind\" the Marianas Trench. The title refers to four levels of alien interaction, and the pedestrian plotting on display proved Steven Spielberg stopped at the right one.",
            "The eerie-jumpy bits simply don't pan out satisfyingly or convincingly.",

            "It's my policy to sit through every film that opens theatrically in Atlanta. If I was going to violate that policy, it would be for this film. I hope I make my point. Paul Chambers, CNN.",
            "The Fourth Kind is more likely to elicit laughter than the suspense it promised in the opening monologue.",
            "Frankly, this movie is quite scary when it's viewed with the idea that this is the film version of creepy disappearances that are really happening in Nome, Alaska. When it's not that, it's almost laughable.",
            "Where is Fox Mulder when you need him?",
            "The \"The Fourth Kind\" poses as another successful documentary on the hot trail of \"Paranormal Activity\". Too bad this film is missing many ingredients to make it a blockbuster success.",
            "He apparently thinks white owls are a lot scarier than they are. (I mean, I guess because their heads swivel around, you can't sneak up on them from behind. But when would you need to sneak up on an owl?)",
            "Purporting to be a true story of alien abduction, in reality it's a clumsy attempt to update the hoax technique Orson Welles perfected seven decades ago."

            "Crazy Heart is a wonderful picture that will immediately affect you and hold your interest to the very end. ",
            "Crazy Heart feels familiar, even comforting, offering few surprises but a wealth of lovingly crafted, immaculately judged, wholly authentic emotion.",
            "This turn from the perennially settled and contented Bridges is pure acting. It is the best performance of the past 12 months, and indeed possibly the next.",
            "A wonderfully easy, confident and muscular performance from Jeff Bridges - so easy, confident and muscular that it doesn't look like acting at all - saves this movie from being pure sentimental mush.",
            "Cooper's film may not make all the right choices, but it's got Bridges, and it's always got the songs, among which Ryan Bingham's The Weary Kind stands out for its haunting, choked melancholy. It's an experience you want to indulge, and that isn't hard.",
            "It's not possible to flaw Bridges here. Akin to Falstaff, the detail of his characterisation - from stagger to cough to swagger to song - is fascinating. But he needs more thorough contextualisation to fly.",
            "Crazy Heart is too sentimental and predictable to be a classic, but the songs are impressively authentic and Bridges delivers a superb performance.",
            "One of the best films of 2009.",
            "What keeps this indie drama just the right side of average is a brilliantly measured, Oscar-winning performance by the great Jeff Bridges. ",
            "Crazy Heart has the mellow, believable gait of real life, and sometimes the truth is better than any reassuring fiction.",
            "Do yourself a favor. Just go crazy this weekend. Go crazy for CRAZY HEART.",
            "Truly, the entire cast is tremendous-with the glaring exception of Farrell, who is woefully miscast. But Bridges carries the film on his capable shoulders, appearing in every scene, many times alone.",
            "The earnest charm, the moments of clarity and regret, and the amazing talent he imbues Blake with make us long for the singer's redemption. Sadly, his path of deliverance is not nearly as engaging or authentic as the man himself.",
            "This is a story that's been told a thousand times, sometimes with Kris Kristofferson in it, and sometimes not, and it just doesn't bring anything new to the party.",
            "With great performances from Bridges and Gyllenhaal, Crazy Heart is a winner and a must-see.",
            "Basically a live-action version of the cliche country-western song with a man down on his luck and losing everything in his life, it comes close to being a joke about itself.",
            "Bridges' worn down country singer is as well realized as any character he's ever done. It may take a while to get going, and to develop, and to wrap up, but there's enough meat to make Crazy Heart worthwhile, even if it is made to last a while.",
            "Played by a gracefully aging Jeff Bridges, Bad is an older, greasier and groggier version of The Dude",
            "Cooper is so afraid of being bold and baring some soul, he achieves little more than the anachronistic, cookie-cutter blues that his lead character spent a lifetime trying to avoid.",
            "Barry Markowitz's camerawork at times captures the hazy heat of the American southwest, giving it a sepia-toned warmth, while this grainy wash gives Blake's late-night bender scenes a green-about-the-gills feel. ",
            "Formidable acting talent aside, this is routine self-destruction-and-recovery TV movie material.",
            "Don't expect greatness from the man named Bad",
            "Jeff Bridges finally won his Oscar for Crazy Heart and it was well-earned indeed."
