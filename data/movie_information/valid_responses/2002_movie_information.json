            "What an eyeful it is. This is probably the greatest battlepiece composed for the screen since Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible.",
            "This film is a towering achievement, and the next installment can't come soon enough.",
            "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is like being trapped in a nerd's bedroom.",
            "The Two Towers is a satisfying and wholly gripping drama in its own right. Inevitably, Janus-like, it looks back to the Shire, and forward to the hour of doom. And after three hours, you will too.",
            "When Gandalf arrives with reinforcements, descending a near-vertical slope using horses where you or I would use snowboards, the spirit of triumphant rampage is something rarely glimpsed since the days of Olivier and Henry V.",
            "To live up to expectations, The Two Towers only had to be as good as its predecessor -- and, astoundingly, it's better.",
            "What Jackson's storytelling lacks in coherency - a major problem for non-Tolkienites with the first film - he makes up for with a new-found sense of urgency and a richer blend of drama, humour and human emotion.",
            "In terms of battle sequences alone, it's hard to find one that's quite as daunting and absorbing as the Battle for Helm's Deep in The Two Towers...",
            "The climactic battle of Helm's Deep - though it still leaves much to be resolved for the final part - is a breathtakingly colossal skirmish in the rain and mud and fog.",
            "Call it a pretty good film and I'll agree with you. Call it a great one, and I will beg to differ.",
            "It also has... layers of political dynamics going on which I actually thought was pretty interesting.",
            "The Two Towers succeeds like few other middle installments do in serving as both a satisfying benchmark that ties the introduction and conclusion to this trilogy together.",
            "I think this one might be the actual best of the franchise and it's all because of the Ents.",
            "this three hour epic is one of those few films where you leave feeling they could have spent even more time with story explanation and exposition",
            "These Tolkien films have a weight and seriousness that very few sword-and-sorcery pictures of the past 30-odd years have attained.",
            "This is, I can say without fear of exaggerating, one of the great films of all time.",
            "Much of the movie is exciting. But none of it is as satisfying as what Jackson was able to create in Fellowship, the first film.",
            "While the acting is once more solid throughout, even with the Shakespearean Ian McKellen given too little to do as the good wizard Gandalf, the most impressive performance of all comes from digital magicians who created the wretched Gollum, Smeagol.",
            "While some people think this surpasses the original, I don't. The storylines are fractured and geographically and narratively it's sometimes hard to figure out what's going on... but the positives are many.",
            "Most moviegoers will leave buzzing about the climactic Battle of Helm's Deep. But in my eyes, this is Gollum's show more than anyone else's, even the special-effects wizards behind the scenes.",
            "The battle for Gollum's mind also provides a fitting teaser conclusion to the second act of a story I'm beginning to wish would never end.",
            "The Two Towers was always going to be the toughest book to adapt, yet Peter Jackson pulls it off. Part Two is easily as exciting, involving and visually inventive as Part One.",
            " It's darker and more urgent than the opening segment, and Jackson again displays an unparalleled grasp of storytelling on a grand scale.",
            "Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a pitch-perfect second act, full of dark wonder and the slow, pounding pulse of Aragorn's unflagging hope."

            "Spielberg creates an intriguing world that is at once futuristic and accessible, it makes our collective imagination soar but is never alienating.",
            "If less poetic than AI, Minority Report is much more confidently directed, with a firmer sense of its maker's own urge to entertain and stimulate rather than bemuse.",
            "The worst thing about the new Steven Spielberg picture is the title, Minority Report. The best thing about it is pretty much everything else.",
            "Though his movie wraps challenging ideas and ingenious visual conceits in a futurist film-noir style, it's pretentious, didactic and intentionally but mercilessly bleak.",
            "High-concept science-fiction escapades often try to impose new ways of seeing, but Spielberg seems intent on blistering our optic nerves.",
            "For its stunning visuals and standout performances, Minority Report -- or at least the first three-fourths of it -- might just be the best movie so far this year.",
            "The level of fantasy frequently rivals the severer science-fiction elements, radiating Spielberg's brand of lively storytelling.",
            "Though it's not among the finest adaptations of Philip K. Dick, Minority Report has aged rather well with its prescient, paranoiac glimpse of the not-distant-enough future.",
            "It's a handsome film-certainly better than A.I.-but ultimately rather tedious and falsely sentimental, as Spielberg films have a tendency to be.",
            "Deviation from the original Dick story leaves huge gaps in the plot which require implausible explanations in order to close out the film.",
            "By turning Dick's ironic little story into a gargantuan thriller celebrating free choice, Spielberg has been true to his character: He's transformed something dark and scary into something softer and more comfortable.",
            "Even if he belabors the ending and can't resist tempering the darkness with a strained ray of hopefulness, Minority Report is a document that proves Spielberg among the top ranks in a minority of film geniuses.",
            "This is a grown-up movie by men who've suddenly realised that their inner Peter Pans have deserted them.",
            "Too much of Minority Report is facile, albeit at a very high level.",
            "This masterfully sleek vision of the future from director Steven Spielberg is an awesome mix of skewed science fiction, twisty Hitchcock-style thrills, stunning blue-grey tinged photography and outstanding design.",
            "[Minority Report] takes themes from Blade Runner, Total Recall and especially the little seen Gary Fleder-directed Impostor and stirs them up into an absorbing thriller.",
            "The movie's combination of old and new influences energizes its believable futuristic elements.",
            "Not simply Steven Spielberg's most prescient sci-fi work but also one of his finest.",
            "Violent sci-fi detective movie isn't for kids.",
            "Vigorously entertaining and tremendously weird, \"Minority Report\" feels like a vintage Action Comics adventure spiked with acid. It's an uncommonly melancholy blockbuster about demons ruthlessly determining our fate even as we relentlessly flee them.",
            "Ferociously intense, furiously kinetic, it's expressionist film noir science fiction that, like all good sci-fi, peers into the future to shed light on the present.",
            "One of the few films I've seen so far this year that I would recommend and it is one to see on the big screen.",
            "While the way in which Minority Report presents these ideas makes them far more incredible and fantastical, it's their truth...that turns the film into something far more dark and sinister.",
            "...a stylish, thoughtful, and thought-provoking future-noir thriller."

            "Farrell ... thankfully manages to outshine the role and successfully plays the foil to Willis's world-weary colonel.",
            "Nationality, race and politics clash in unexpected ways in this well-directed and acted but extremely old-fashioned prison drama that recalls genre film sof the 1950s and 1960s.",
            "In the ever-increasing onslaught of war movies, it stands head and shoulders above most of the competition.",
            "'Hart's War' is a perfect example of a film that remains anchored in mediocrity from beginning to end. It plods along like a chronic asthmatic, meandering to a conclusion that's both irritating and implausible.",
            "...Suitably gritty and intense...",

            "Paint-by-numbers claptrap.",
            "As old-fashioned as it can get, a throwback to cinema's Golden Age and a tribute to the flawed, guilty human beings we call heroes.",
            "As an American propagandistic attempt to market patriotism (or courage, or honor), it is arguably successful; by its own merits it is merely decent.",
            "The movie's surplus of male-fraternizing never conveys that these Americans are under imminent danger and stress.",
            "Hart's War is an absorbing courtroom drama that gives Farrell the chance to show off his star quality although the ending disappoints.",
            "It makes a few fundamental mistakes along the way--mostly due to Willis' star power--but it's still thoroughly entertaining",
            "A perfectly respectable, perfectly inoffensive, easily forgettable film."

            "Powerful, but only for 17 and up.",

            "Difficult to watch but hard to look away from.",

            "A masterpiece of modern filmmaking.",
            "City Of God is the very definition of cinematic lightning in a bottle.",
            "It's point-blank perspective on murder and growing up amidst the violence will leave U.S. moviegoers feeling a macabre sense of satisfaction, immediately followed by horror, as they witnesses the vicious cycle of violence repeats itself anew.",
            "Another passionate piece of Latin American filmmaking, which documents a tragic period in Rio's history and highlights the horrors of life in poverty-line communities. Technically a remarkable filmmaking achievement too.",
            "Each chapter is endowed with powerful, uncompromising, beguiling and, sometimes, deceptive momentum. What seem like innocuous turns become so critical to the narrative that they tie into the ruthless idea at hand: You never see the bullet that kills you.",
            "Brazillian director Mereilles' splashy feature debut, a dynamically exciting portrait of Rio's violent gangs, immediately established himsef as an international talent to watch, and the Oscar nods only reaffirmed that status.",
            "Fernando Meirelles' Brazilian slum epic is a profound, stylistically expansive depiction of three decades of child gang warfare on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro with non-actors playing their poverty-ridden lives for the camera.",

            "Steven Soderbergh's extremely sedate, Spartan science-fiction thriller and love story pits man's common sense and perceptions of a higher power against his own dreams and desires.",
            "It's an unusual challenge for a Hollywood film with a major star, but worth the effort.",

            "When a movie gets it all impeccably, heartbreakingly right, as does Todd Haynes' stunning Far from Heaven, some critics are tempted to gush deepest purple...I'll try to stay anchored to more sensible levels of bliss.",
            "With a classic storytelling style bordering on corniness, a deft tragicomic touch and a heroic refusal to use the safety net of irony, Haynes has managed to produce something of a gem.",
            "Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid are outstanding as Cathy and Frank Whitaker, a perfect couple with a decidedly imperfect love life.",
            "The actors move about this elaborate movie museum in a modified dream state, as if living in the present while rooted in the past. But the strategy doesn't work. It's an imitation of lifelessness.",
            "We are left wondering why, in any case, an imitation Sirk was needed, what appetite or interest it might fill. Even with its latter-day (modified) frankness, Far From Heaven is only thin glamour that lacks a tacit wry base.",
            "With tact and care, the movie digs into all the subjects that lay concealed below the surface when Max Ophuls and Douglas Sirk were filming their own melodramas in the nineteen-fifties.",
            "Perhaps one of the most remarkable tributes by one filmmaker to another ever made.",
            "Writer-director Todd Haynes' modern masterpiece wasn't merely the best film of 2002; it also ranked as one of the 10 best films of its decade.",
            "Haynes was miraculously able to provide a commentary on class, gender and race relations that not only dissected the utopian fallacy of '50s America but made it resonate today",
            "I'll say two things about an Oscar nomination for Julianne Moore for best actress: for sure and at least.",
            "Far From Heaven should create a wider audience for Haynes, long considered one of America's leading independent directors.",
            "Could Haynes go on making films if the health police were ever to let up? He apparently needs to define himself in opposition to their controlling mindset.",
            "Quaid makes a decent man's anguish richly palpable. Moore makes us feel hidden frenzy with a cool and ultimately heartbreaking grace.",
            "Haynes doesn't simply take a Norman Rockwell setting and release the hounds, either. He deals with these issues directly, but gently, as if his and Sirk's audiences were the same.",
            "Todd Haynes has crafted a feature-length homage to Sirk that succeeds both on its own terms and as the Sirk film that could never have been made in his own lifetime.",
            "Moore gives one of the year's great performances -- subtle, lingeringly rich -- in director Todd Haynes's peculiar revisionist homage to old Hollywood women's pictures.",
            "This exquisite evocation of the 1950s tear-jerkers of director Douglas Sirk is gorgeously designed, stunningly photographed, ravishingly scored and beautifully acted.",
            "The arthouse Pleasantville, this handsomely crafted facsimile of '50s melodrama is unengaging and redundant, the lacquered artifice erecting a barrier between screen and audience.",
            "Haynes' loving homage to the Technicolor female-driven melodramas of the 1950s looks and feels so authentic, it will make you forget you are watching a new movie.",
            "A takeoff on Douglas Sirk's overwrought, color-saturated 1950s melodramas that rises above its camp roots and converts artifice into art.",
            "[Haynes'] discomfiting ability to get under the puritanical skin of the US is hampered here by the confines of imitative homage.",
            "Haynes' most fully realized and commercially succesful feature to date is that rare thing, a meticulous homage to Douglas Sirk as well as a poignant drama in its own right.",

            "It is certainly one of the best Bollywood movies you will see in 2007.",
            "Filmmaker Mani Ratnam leavens his trademark politically charged melodrama with a smoking belly dance by sultry Mallika Sherawat and a wet-sari number for the stunning Rai.",
            "Ratnam's absorbing screenplay ensures that Guru rises above the usual rags to riches story.",
            "Strongly cast, long-limbed yarn contains some of Ratnam's best stuff in its first half but script weaknesses mar the later going and film's overall impact.",
            "There is a lot to engage the eye and the ear in Guru.",
            "Mani Ratnam is a master film-maker, in fact, he's probably the best. Definitely the most revered - and India's answer to Spielberg.",
            "The film is a triumph of casting: In a role that is often about the sheer steamrolling force of his character's personality, Abishek Bachchan's attention to detail makes Guru accessible rather than intimidating, admirable but also plausible.",
            "Boasts excellent production values, enjoyable dance numbers and two charismatic turns from normally lightweight stars.",
            "Unlike most mainstream filmmakers, Ratnam doesn't try to include something for everyone, but he does deliver several handsome production numbers.",
            "Even if you have never heard of [Dhirubhai] Ambani or know little about India and its history, you can still appreciate GURU for its terrific cast and its strong direction and script.",
            "Mani Ratnam's often absorbing Guru is sort of a Bollywood Citizen Kane, a decades-spanning drama with a compelling Abhishek Bachchan as a ruthless Indian business tycoon who refuses to take no for an answer."

            "This sprawling and ecletic work from Spike Lee has, in a sense, more going for it in the ragged fringes of its story than in its slightly awkward, pre-determined centre.",
            "A reminder of how human beings can lose their humanity in the face of grief and tragedy but can find it again through helping others rather than turning a blind eye. It's an important work of art.",

            "An under-rated gem, 25th Hour is a powerful story about how the decisions you make in your life, and who you make them with, can ultimately lead to your downfall. ",
            "One of Spike Lee's best films...",
            "Lee successfully, seamlessly marries his famously inventive visual style with more introspective material.",
            "Lee builds Monty's story of tortured introspection and his final surprising, desperate act before incarceration through boldly candid conversations and flashbacks.",
            "Perhaps Lee's most consistently compelling work since Clockers.",
            "Lee's best, most cohesive and most passionate film since Do the Right Thing.",

            "At times, it feels as stultifying as watching paint dry, without the recompense of sniffing fumes.",
            "One of those rare movies that works as a humbling experience.",
            "This is a film that all aspiring teachers should see, as well as veteran teachers who might have lost track of what teaching is all about.",

            "Sweet, ultimately poignant portrait of a year in the life of a one-room school in Auvergne...an evocative, observant portrait.",
            "Reveals... the teacher's-and the director's-love for the children and an aching nostalgia for a way of life that's on its way out...",
            "In its discussion of the natural, essential roles of learning and teaching in life, \u00catre et Avoir is an elegantly shot, eloquently stated, first-class report.",
            "A testament to the scary responsibility of primary education, and a powerful tribute to the nobility and unselfishness -- and vital importance -- of the teaching profession."

            "Watching The Ring won't kill you, but it could bore you half to death.",
            "I hated it, but I grant that it does tap into a vein of technological horror -- the fear of the VCR! -- that will have young videophiles chatting it up for weeks.",

            "One of the most intelligent and genuinely scary ghost stories to come around in a long time.",
            "The Ring doesn't have the wiliness or conviction to exploit either a single mother's guilt over child neglect or our collective queasiness over potential bad seeds. It merely alternates these themes and toys with them.",
            "The Ring, an elegantly creepy film set in a perpetual Seattle rainstorm, is interested more in eerie, unnerving thrills than bloodletting.",
            "The slow pace gives us too much time to think about the story's lapses in logic. And Verbinski's style is so conventional that the various scare devices and horror images he throws on the screen feel oddly more comforting than frightening.",
            "Though more expensive and less atmospheric than the Japanese picture, the film isn't at all bad.",
            "A chilling idea, finely executed, in a rare remake success. See it if you dare -- but we wouldn't recommend you go alone.",
            "Verbinski makes a couple of inventive additions, and although the spine-chilling terror of the superior 1997 original is muted by the overuse of CGI, this is still a worthy substitute if you're not in the mood for subtitles.",
            "The Ring is easily the most terrifying movie to come out of Hollywood in years.",

            "Oh boy, this one is creepy. Creepy like a single, leaden knock on your front door when you're home all alone and it's 2:30 in the morning and it's October, and you're not expecting anyone and then the doorknob turns. Creepy like that.",
            "The movie's nifty beginning-all anxiety and dread-suggests that the audience is in for a fearful ride, but the one-dimensional story quickly runs out of fuel.",
            "Director Gore Verbinski maintains a consistently unsettling mood and look to the film, even if the story often falls by the wayside.",
            "A well-made remake that adds quite a bit to the original story. Alas, The Ring also feels dated and dull.",
            "It's a treasure hunt reduced to isolated jolts and more clues than you can shake a stick at (every fly on the wall and child's drawing bristles with unholy significance), and an utter waste of Watts."

            "As unlikely as an insightful and riveting film about a poor white Detroit kid succeeding beyond his surroundings through Rap music might be, \"8 Mile\" is that gloriously gritty movie."

            "What makes it special is the inner turmoil caused by living a lie. If everyone you know and everything you do for 10 years indicates you are one kind of person, and you know you are another, how do you live with that?",
            "Seductively shot and beautifully acted, this is like a summation film, bringing together all the themes, motifs, mood, and style of the gritty policier Hong Kong thriller, one that will make John Woo and Michael Mann proud.",

            "well-written, well-directed and well-acted genre film",
            "Um inteligente drama policial que se preocupa mais com o desenvolvimento de seus personagens (e com as rela\u00e7\u00f5es entre estes) do que com tiroteios e reviravoltas.",
            "Far too light on action to be very exciting, and far too generic and familiar to be genuinely intriguing, Infernal Affairsis ultimately a forgettable affair.",
            "Potboiler Hong Kong cop drama with a fairly interesting plot about moral dilemmas and mixed allegiances.",
            "Solid character-centric piece that's more interested in psychology than in gritty action sequences.",
            "...has an intensity usually reserved for Greek tragedy.",

            "More reasonably plotted than most films of the action genre.",
            "A blistering thriller and an intelligent character study and a comic take-off on the conventions of thrillers.",
            "This is the type of movie Asian action fans talk about when they say they love the genre.",
            "The twists offered in Infernal Affairs ... take the genre to enthralling new heights, guaranteeing that any future such efforts will have an entirely new bar for which to aim.",
            "Infernal Affairs is the combustible Hong Kong fever dream that would emerge from a night spent watching Heat and Donnie Brasco back to back.",
            "This is what movies are supposed to feel like -- provocative, exciting, chilling, complex and fully engaging."

            "Though such elements might chip away somewhat at Amen's seriousness of intent, they do add fire to the stimulating drama.",

            "Tukur's performance is the centerpiece of the movie; it's a wonderful mixture of outrage and swiftly disappearing naivete.",
            "Costa-Gavras' political thrillers used to jab and thrust with lethal efficiency. This one just pounds against a heavy bag, huffing and puffing all the way.",
            "In a remarkably subtle turn, the German Tukur is convincing as [Gerstein].",
            "What should have been agonizing in its impact comes off as wooden, perhaps because Costa-Gavras works in schematic fashion, spoon-feeding us issues while skimming the historical surface.",
            "a sputtering, wet firecracker",
            "Though Costa-Gavras brings nothing new to the table about the Holocaust, he puts another nail down in the argument that the world could have acted but didn't because of indifference.",
            "It's so inert, so slow-moving that it seems at least twice as long as it really is, and it manages to waste a potentially fascinating premise.",
            "Costa-Gavras often shortchanges the story's inherent drama for talky and strident speechifying.",
            "Extremely heavy-handed, almost comically repetitious, and way too long.",
            "Less a gripping drama than a stimulating bit of polemic.",
            "A movie that suggests the Holocaust may be an endless source of absorbing, heartbreaking dramas.",
            "Costa-Gavras tells this heartbreaking tale of lost opportunity with an emotional restraint that makes it all the more powerful.",
            "Amen., a docudrama rather than a documentary, is clearly guided by Shoah's example, asking us to reflect on the Holocaust and what made it possible rather than simply recoil from it.",
            "It goes without saying that no one will disagree with the movie's politics, but the movie itself -- the artistry and storytelling -- are as flimsy and clumsy as you can get.",
            "Costa-Gavras returns to full potency with this masterful film, an examination of culpability as well as the biography of a little known figure whose story deserves to be told.",
            "An expose of the Catholic hierarchy in a state of mind-boggling paralysis, presented in a fictional context that, inevitably, dulls its edge and makes us question its accuracy.",
            "It is the director's most ambitious film in years and one of his least compelling.",
            "Relentlessly heavy-handed but quite compelling nonetheless."

            "For once, a sequel would be welcome.",

            "One man's heart-pounding crusade to tear down the crooked system that created him...",
            "Although the basic amnesia plot sets up a potential for excitement, the editing immediately becomes the most detrimental component in the action-packed world of Jason Bourne.",

            "Breathtakingly, beautifully simple.",

            "\"The Bourne Identity\" is a well-written action spy film that stays true to its espionage thriller genre while inflicting flinch-inducing moments of pure cinematic action.",

            "This is a long sweet breath of fresh air in the action genre...",
            "Farfetched plotting nearly capsizes this globe-trotting thriller but director Doug Liman certainly keeps the international intrigue and testosterone flowing at an entertaining clip.",
            "You may be surprised by the fact that this formula spy thriller has been delivered with a matter-of-fact efficiency that proves highly entertaining.",
            "A sleek espionage thriller that reduces the world to the size of a postage stamp. Matt Damon is terrific.",
            "The movie is about muscular speed and skill, and that's all it's about. Like its hero, it's blank by design.",
            "...Liman is also clever enough to make the real action start when the motor stops.",
            "Plenty of very cool fight scenes, edited such that although they are fast-paced, you can actually see what's happening.",
            "The Bourne Identity is an intense, violent, bite-your-nails-to-the-quick thriller.",
            "One of the many problems, other than Damon's lack of emotion, is the fact that there's no suspense.",
            "Also helped immeasurably by an unusually cool score by John Powell, Mr. Liman also makes good use of the European settings, alternating between close ups of Damon's frustrated face and wider pans that slurp up the snow clad France setting."

            "You can almost feel the dull heat radiating off the screen -- it's a wonder cinematographer Fabio Zamarion's lenses didn't simply melt clean off -- and this thick and hazy brilliance infuses the story with all sorts of strange neo-realistic vibes.",
            "A beautifully scenic but languid character study that could use a shot of adrenalin and a more straightforward story line.",
            "A quietly disarming drama by Emanuele Crialese that tugs at family ties and calls into question the conventional definition of 'normal.'",
            "Somewhere along the way, Respiro just seems to run out of breath.",
            "Respiro is a psychologically dense, provocative film that feels like a cautionary tale about a vision of paradise that is compromised by a civilization that keeps uncontrollable forces in check.",
            "Crialese's stated purpose is to create a sense of magical realism, and even as he draws on an actual fable to do so, there's an incomplete feeling to the production.",
            "It is sort of the opposite of 'Northern Exposure' where everyone is quirky, and loving it. Here, quirkiness is opposed strongly.",
            "Respiro begins as a portrait of a woman who refuses to abide by the conventions of the comunity and ends with a bit of inspired magical realism.",
            "Though the story is warmly humanistic it is too paper thin to mean much.",
            "We're slouched back with our heads resting on the tops of the seats, relaxing and letting our minds leap out of our heads to spend 95 minutes at play in Lampedusa.",
            "A mixture of great Italian cinema and fluffy silliness.",
            "An inviting performance by Golino and some outstanding underwater photography enliven director/writer Emanuele Crialese's adaptation of an Italian legend.",
            "Whatever its shortcomings, Respiro provides [Valeria Golino] with a juicy leading role, and she takes full advantage of the opportunity.",
            "Golino's performance is effortlessly haunting; it's a shame she doesn't have more of a movie to hang it on.",
            "If the Italian Neo-Realists had ever granted themselves enough romanticism (or found a little money) to shoot in color, they might have made Respiro."

            "This time, the adventures of the world's most famous young wizard come mixed with a stiff dose of the menacing. ",
            "Director Chris Columbus has pushed the envelope farther, made a sequel that is pacier and more swashbuckling. Yet it still feels cautious and reined-in.",
            "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is darker, funnier and finer than its forerunner Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.",
            "Columbus' pacing is still murderously slow, his ideas as pedestrian as the worst TV.",
            "Apart from a rather pointless cameo from Kenneth Branagh and a rather peaky-looking Richard Harris, in truth there was nothing in HP2 that we hadn't already seen in HP1.",
            "This new Harry Potter has its flaws, but it's better, as well as darker, than the first.",
            "Rather than better or worse, the films were almost an extension of the books, wonderfully bringing to life JK Rowling's fantastical Wizarding World as the definitive franchise an entire generation grew up with.",
            "This time around, the humor and family-friendly fun can't overcome the annoying supporting characters and repetition from the previous picture.",
            "Brilliant stuff.",
            "At 162 minutes, this sounds like a long film, but the time passes quickly...almost too quickly. A technical and visual masterpiece. ",
            "Good film directed for a teenage audience in which not only is magic taught but also how stereotypes affect it while the film itself recreates some British stereotypes. [Review in Spanish]",
            "Director David Yates deals with this change of tone skillfully.",
            "Chamber Of Secrets is funnier and more exciting than the first Harry Potter movie, and adorned with some of the most stunning special effects ever.",
            "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets isn't perfect, but it's everything it should be: fun, exciting, humorous and stirring.",
            "Have no fear, you legions of Potter fans: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a solid step forward in the movie adaptations of J.K. Rowling's much-read novels.",
            "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is good enough to satisfy hard-core fans, even if it falls short of being truly transporting moviemaking.",
            "Despite its sophomoric awkwardness, the Chamber of Secrets is a welcome delivery of childlike wonder for a planet of ever- increasing ugliness.",
            "Although it's unlikely to make converts of the uninitiated, fans of the series and its characters will find the movie to be a worthy entry.",
            "It appears that the production has learned from its mistakes and managed to put together the kind of film that deserves to be a part of young adult film folklore for generations to come.",
            "Two down, presumably five to go, and already the franchise is entering dangerous territory: if you aren't one of the many who know their Harry Potter chapter and verse, prepare for a nap.",
            "Columbus carefully avoids overly replaying the visual wonders of his first episode, and heedfully edits and amplifies Rowling's story for the screen, preserving its spooky darkness.",
            "Better story, better acting, better characters and better effects. All they need is to sort out the dialogue next time, and everyone's a winner.",
            "[Chamber of Secrets] is more tightly plotted than the original film and boasts a welcome, lighter touch in its early scenes. But it devolves, during its wearying 161-min. running time, into a been-there-fought-that action hero yarn.",
            "Director Chris Columbus (again working from a screenplay by Steve Kloves) has allowed some mechanical repetition to creep in, but overall this manages to be ingenious as well as faithful to its source."

            "It not only promotes every stereotype and invokes every clich\u00e9 of Brooklyn lore, it combines them all into an insulting composite, fuses that to the chrome-and-fins of the pointless Fifties, and then -- weirdly -- pretends it's Shakespeare.",
            "Skip it. Just fill in the blanks and you too can brew the same bland, goopy mixture.",
            "A flashback to a heroin casualty on a rain-soaked playground is a crucial visual aid, but any punch-drunk victim of Deuces Wild might prefer the needle to the damage done.",

            "Scott Kalvert's attempt at a gangster picture is the worst film of 2002.",
            "It's full of sound and fury, and the ensemble tries hard, but mob boss Fitzy has it right: They're just kids who need to grow up.",
            "This clich\u00e9d tale of combative Brooklyn street gangs in the late 1950s gets it so wrong in so many ways, it's almost cruel to count them.",
            "Deuces Wild's not worth anteing up the ticket price.",
            "What died in here, and who can we call to take its carcass away?",
            "If it was the intention of Kalvert, Gambale and Kimatian to infiltrate their script with every stereotypical hoodlum clich\u00e9 from every movie covering Brooklyn bad boys, they were on the money. Too bad their movie isn't.",
            "Slow-motion shots of swaggering tough guys punctuate this painfully hackneyed gang drama set in late-50s Brooklyn.",
            "The script from first-timers Paul Kimatian and Christopher Gambale requires Dillon to say corny things like: 'Bricks don't fall outta the sky in this neighborhood unless I'm throwin' 'em.' Tony Soprano, he ain't.",
            "Tentando desesperadamente se transformar em uma esp\u00e9cie de O Selvagem da Motocicleta do novo mil\u00eanio (com toques de Amor, Sublime Amor), o filme \u00e9 esquem\u00e1tico demais, tornando-se artificial e nada envolvente.",

            "It is not revolutionary, but it brims with promise and a love of film, and is a fine if worried dance indeed.",
            "Though flawed and listless as a political drama or thriller, Malkovich's feature debut deserves credit for itis ambition and for tackling an overtly political theme (guerrilla wars in Peru), a rare sight in today's indie milieu.",
            "Em sua estr\u00e9ia na dire\u00e7\u00e3o, Malkovich conduz a hist\u00f3ria com seguran\u00e7a e sem exibicionismo, enquanto Bardem oferece mais uma grande atua\u00e7\u00e3o.",

            "A bit like an adolescent - desperate to be taken seriously, yet still self-consciously goofy and immature.",

            "The film's 45-minute running time stops shy of overkill, though viewers may be more exhausted than the athletes onscreen."

            "The visuals are strong, while the central narrative is weak (a disastrous combination for a long movie). Worst of all, Gangs of New York achieves far too little while trying much too hard.",
            "Brilliant but devastating. High schoolers and up.",
            "It's never less than compelling, driven by an overwhelming, larger than life performance from Day-Lewis and by Scorsese's grandiose historical imagination.",

            "Gangs of New York is one of those haunting failures. I can't get over it; it still gives me a pang every time I think of it. It seemed so filled with potential. ",
            "Scorsese scores some fine political points along the way and demonstrates the mastery of his craft in every scene, but the underlying theme of brutal revenge at any cost loses its way too early on... ",
            "One of Scorsese's weakest films, a wannabe historical epic that's essentially a formulaic revenge saga, lacking unified vision and style. The only reason to see it is Daniel Day-Lewis' vividly compelling performance as Bill the Butcher.",
            "[A] flawed masterpiece.",
            "The whole may not add up to the sum of its parts, but it's difficult to dismiss the brilliance of those parts.",
            "It's a story of such relevance to New York, to America and even to the rest of the world, that just had to be told on film with as much impact as a filmmaker can muster. And Martin Scorsese musters much.",
            "The impact is all in the broad strokes of Scorsese's design: the corresponding coming-of-age stories of three confused and violent adolescents: Amsterdam Vallon, New York City, and America. [Blu-Ray]",
            "Why did Scorsese spend three decades thirsting to make this movie? It's nowhere clear on the screen.",
            "Gangs becomes a standard revenge opus. And a long one at that.",
            "It's a story of violence, revenge, racial intolerance and class struggle, and it's a story told extremely well.",
            "Martin Scorseses dream project finally explodes on the screen after years of planning and another year of delays.",
            "Day-Lewis's sneering, roaring, monstrous performance as the Butcher will remind you of the seemingly superhuman work Robert DeNiro performed in his prime.",
            "It is unrelentingly gritty and tense.",
            "Daniel Day-Lewis' magnetic portrayal of a 19th-century ganglord who butchered his enemies as readily as he carved up a freshly killed hog."

            "One of the most purely entertaining films about (for want of a better term) pop music in years.",
            "Coogan, as the consummate overeducated, overly-erudite opinion leader, is spot-on perfect.",
            "It may not be all true, necessarily, but it's super entertaining, and that's what matters in the end, right? ",
            "Tony Wilson's and \"24-Hour Party People's\" tossed-off philosophy was that the worst of times, like the best, pass away - never truer than in the fickle music industry. A free-form view of a freefall where artifice and artistry tumbled head over heels.",
            "Those wishing for a full-on, comprehensive look at the era will be disappointed, but Winterbottom, Coogan, and Boyce serve up a vivid and lively thumbnail sketch.",
            "When it comes to capturing music in a visual medium, 24 Hour Party People ranks right up there with Martin Scorsese's 1978 rock documentary, The Last Waltz.",
            "24 Hour Party People is a frenzied, metafilmic, postmodern splatter of a homage to a music movement . . . a jolting, raucous ride into the celluloid distance.'",

            "From a pure structure standpoint, 24 Hour Party People is extremely interesting and original. Surprisingly slow moving, however.",
            "This is Cult Movie Central -- and there's no livelier tour guide than Michael Winterbottom.",
            "Steve Coogan makes a likeable enough narrator, and director Michael Winterbottom uses enough cinematic tricks to keep things interesting. Still, for those not in the know, 24 Hour Party People can seem 24 hours long.",
            "Director Michael Winterbottom has pulled off an inspired act of self-referencing, post-modern filmmaking that does these people, their attitude, their home, their music, and their legacy proud.",
            "Fans of that period of music should see the film post-haste; others may enjoy it purely from a filmmaking perspective, in which category it succeeds pretty well.",

            "The movie's themes are aptly captured in the double entendre of the title, suggesting both Crane's narcissism and the video technology that abets it...a lot of Auto Focus is coolly funny--it's a slyly satiric comedy of '60s manners.",
            "Another probing case history of male pathology from one of the most consistently interesting American film-makers alive.",
            "An exemplary Schrader work, a painfully funny and misanthropic treatise on American masculinity and its sexualised image.",
            "Kinnear delivers an excellent performance and the delirious imagery lingers for months.",
            "Schrader really isn't interested in Crane except as the straw man for his moral lessons about sin and sexuality and the nature of celebrity.",
            "How do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any? On the evidence before us, the answer is clear: Not easily and, in the end, not well enough.",
            "The technical aspects of the film are quite on the money.",
            "For all its tantalizing forays into the narcotic, head-swimming loss of self and perspective in addiction, Auto Focus never quite extends its sympathy to its characters or convinces us that they are real people. ",
            "The film isn't the least bit erotic, or prurient - or even interesting. ",
            "What makes the material work so well here is the perception that both writer and director choose to execute with its protagonist, which is not to provide overlying sympathy for him or his choices.",
            "Ultimately one-dimensional and superficial look into the life of Bob Crane...",
            "A repetitive and disappointingly shallow look at what is in fact an intriguing Hollywood mystery.",
            "Out of focus.",
            "Sempre fascinante, o filme traz Greg Kinnear e Willem Dafoe em performances absolutamente impec\u00e1veis.",
            "See it for Kinnear's performance, see it for a supreme depiction of the time, but don't go in expecting Citizen Kane. More like Deep Throat.",
            "Given its lurid subject matter, the film is astoundingly bland.",
            "Crane's story is a modern Hollywood tragedy, and Schrader and Kinnear treat it with the utmost respect, creating a film that is both touching and bittersweet.",
            "..interesting for the way it reveals what the advent of the videotape in the '70s has done to all of us. Like the Internet in the '90s, it has helped make what's private public - for better or worse."

            "Rivers and Tides is subtle and meditative almost to a fault ... So it's fortunate that the film is relatively short and that its subject -- Andy Goldsworthy, a Scottish sculptor known for working with nature -- is so fascinating.",
            "A documentary that introduces us to an artist whose work is full of contradictions -- contradictions that spill over into the act of watching the movie.",

            "A lovely, curiously inspiring appreciation of Goldsworthy's unusual artistic vision.",

            "Goldsworthy is meticulous, eccentric, and very talented. Who knows? This may just inspire you to lie down in the road and make 'rain angels'."

            "It has a softer edge than the master probably would have delivered, but it is deeply affecting and recalls the Kumai film best known in the U.S., the 1974 Sandakan 8.",
            "Though formally beautiful, Sea Is Watching is remarkably trite in comparison to the great Japanese films on the subject.",
            "Technically, it's an impossible film to fault--performances, cinematography and art direction are all first-rate, coalescing in a finale that is impressively deft. If only Kurosawa had lived long enough for a rewrite.",

            "Using the Zephyr team's creation, its sudden fame, and death by defection, Dogtown documents genuine 20th century tribalism.",
            "The straight cuts illustrate how the Zephyr team's revolutionary, riffing style was both an extension of surfing and aesthetically beautiful.",
            "There is something I find deeply disturbing about a documentary made about one's own life that never acknowledges its first person status.",
            "The film fearlessly gets under the skin of the people involved ... This makes it not only a detailed historical document, but an engaging and moving portrait of a subculture.",

            "An affectionate look back at those heady days.",

            "The vision of Intimate Stories is amusingly warm-hearted without being cloying or sentimental; the landscape may be harsh, but the performances are inviting.",
            "Like the performances, the movie is a small-scale feat of naturalism.",
            "While the Argentine filmmaker takes his time, his film isn't tedious.",
            "Has no profound statements to make, but it does provide warm and fuzzy comfort.",
            "As stripped down as its title, this gentle Argentinian road movie makes much out of very little.",
            "A small movie, and a modest one.",
            "Bathed in chilly winter air with a fragrance of hot coffee, the film moves at an unhurried pace, taking in the sights and sounds of the various pit stops, and essentially enjoying itself.",
            "It's the surprising but effective payoff to Don Justo's journey that has the most emotional pull, which is due in no small part to newcomer Benedicti's performance.",
            "Vacuous road movie in which vacant characters receive rewards that far outweigh their uninspired goals.",
            "Sorin's charming road comedy captures the humanity of small-town dreamers.",
            "Warm and frequently very funny, Argentine director Carlos Sorin's third feature weaves together three story lines into one road-tripping adventure that's a joy ride from beginning to end.",
            "Gentle, humanistic, delicious.",
            "Almost every frame of this modest gem of a movie, directed by Carlos Sorin from a screenplay by Pablo Solarz, conveys the emptiness of the environment in which three interwoven vignettes unfold.",
            "Endowed with captivating simplicity, gentle humor, rich humanity and infectious generosity of spirit.",
            "Tender, gently luminous road movie.",
            "It's a perfectly realized grace note whose lack of any obvious message only reinforces the movie's abundant wisdom and patient humanism.",
            "Only the highway itself remains constant in Sorin's sweet, shaggy travelogue.",
            "Feels like a campfire yarn bereft of the giant, climactic payoff, instead maintaining a relaxed, almost demure tone of destiny-touched hopefulness",
            "Quiet and unpretentious, the film's humanism isn't confrontational exactly but it's unmistakable nonetheless.",
            "'Minimal Stories' presents three stories about humble life and small joys which intertwine and cross in natural yet ingenious ways.",
            "Contrasting the epic Patagonian landscapes with the modesty of his characters' aspirations, Sorin has crafted an appealing portrait of this remote region."

            "It's too bad that the picture lacks a clear narrative thread and, ultimately, much of a point besides telling a weird little story in an overly familiar sort of way.",
            "It's incredible the number of stories the Holocaust has generated. Just when you think that every possible angle has been exhausted by documentarians, another new film emerges with yet another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective.",
            "An absorbing documentary.",
            "The film is delicately narrated by Martin Landau and directed with sensitivity and skill by Dana Janklowicz-Mann.",
            "The strength of the film comes not from any cinematic razzle-dazzle but from its recovery of an historical episode that, in the simple telling, proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting.",
            "This may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other Holocaust films, but it's a compelling story, mainly because of the way it's told by the people who were there.",
            "The problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage. The images lack contrast, are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable.",
            "This kind of hands-on storytelling is ultimately what makes Shanghai Ghetto move beyond a good, dry, reliable textbook and what allows it to rank with its worthy predecessors.",
            "A modestly made but profoundly moving documentary.",
            "The film isn't especially dynamic, but it brims with insightful, poignant memories from survivors.",
            "Shanghai Ghetto may not be as dramatic as Roman Polanski's The Pianist, but its compassionate spirit soars every bit as high.",
            "The power of Shanghai Ghetto, a documentary by Dana Janklowicz-Mann and Amir Mann, rests in the voices of men and women, now in their 70s, who lived there in the 1940s."

            "Max has precious little sting as a morality tale or punch as a parable about the relationship of art to politics.",
            "For all the food for thought offered by the film, its overall success is diminished by the fact that there's too much Max and not enough Hitler.",

            "A true masterpiece, er, make that, web-masterpiece.",

            "Tobey Maguire brings to the film a tenderness and also a watchfulness... His ability to endow lines as basic as \"Goblin, what have you done?\" with introspective echoes carries the film to a deeper place.",
            "If there are 15 spiders in a lab that can give you superpowers, why does just one kid get them?",

            "This is the fun blockbuster of the summer: great characters, great heart, great performances -- everything that Star Wars isn't.",
            "In the face of almighty expectations, director Sam Raimi delivers an efficient, entertaining film which promises to crush box office records.",
            "Here is the best of the superhero films to have emerged from Hollywood.",

            "Not since 1978's Superman has there been a live-action, comic book-based film so savvy at mixing self-aware camp with sincere emotion, and so successful at establishing the normal guy life of its spandexed protagonist."

            "Amadeus is a movie masterpiece: engaging, beautifully performed and staged, and packed with emotional power.",
            "Both Shaffer and Forman sidestep traps of being too obvious or of oversimplifying. Consequently, both Mozart and Salieri emerge as complex figures, full of contrasting impulses.",

            "The performance of Abraham, who won the Best Actor Oscar for it, is monumental, and so is Forman's direction.",
            "Amadeus is simply one of the finest biographical dramas ever made.",
            "Forman's tormented, iconoclastic subjects are often pitted against iconic or impersonal antagonists, but Amadeus' conflict remains rivetingly intimate, in spite of its sumptuous, larger-than-life settings.",
            "A rowdy, funny, suspenseful, and sometimes very moving visit with two fascinating personalities: one an uncouth prodigy, the other an earnest second-rater who never quite understands why somebody else should get all the glory."

            "Del Toro is a stylish horrormeister, and he has created an evocative, foreboding atmosphere. But only a fan of this kind of mayhem could find a way into the story. And only a critic, sworn to serve, could stick it out to the end.",
            "No one seems to be having much fun, with the possible exception of Kris Kristofferson, who is back as Blade's venerable human sidekick, Whistler. The film finds few variations on the themes of run, kick, chomp and gulp. ",

            "Blade II is a better vampire movie than recent entries such as Queen of the Damned or Dracula 2000. That said, Wesley Snipes' return as slayer of the undead still is fairly anemic.",
            "Blade II is an incredibly upbeat picture, and rather than focus on Blade's loneliness or how he's humanity's protector and yet can never truly be one of them, del Toro gleefully jumps into the action scenes.",
            "The plot is essentially Blade fighting a bunch of people, then talking to a bunch of people, then fighting a bunch of people, then talking to a bunch of people, and keep repeating. Over and over.",

            "In the inventive fight scenes, [Blade's] sword clangs, and there are sluicing sounds when it finds its target, all in keeping with the unapologetic bang! blam! pop! comic-book spin director Guillermo Del Toro brings to the film.",
            "The original Blade movie was a chilling, gory vampire story, energetic and stylish -- all in all, a bloodthirsty success. The second one's chaotic and dumb and almost completely without thrills.",
            "Del Toro's aim is brutally simple: to give your adrenalin glands a bootcamp work-out. Granted, the spin-dry visuals and hectic tempo mean the style is the content -- but what style, what energy and what a bloody great sequel.",
            "It's a fabulous-looking package, elegantly orchestrated by del Toro, who has an unerring eye for undead iconography, which he takes to visually imaginative extremes.",
            "The frenetic fight scenes are too fast for non-vampire eyes, but those familiar with the original should find plenty to like.",

            "Visually, it's about as exciting as C-Span. Doesn't matter. Chomsky, at 74, is as radical as ever.",
            "Kept me interested for its full 74 minutes with a series of surprises.",
            "Would have benefited from putting a wider lens on the man and his detractors, as seen in 1992's superior Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media by Mark Achbar and Peter Wintonick.",
            "Because what Noam is thinking is always of interest, this brief and reverential film is as well.",
            "This sometimes fawning documentary is selling a simple image of Chomsky to his faithful, not expanding on or further discussing the man's ideas.",
            "There are better and more entertaining ways to grapple with Noam Chomsky's theories.",
            "As film it's drab. As Chomsky it's compelling.",
            "Whether or not you agree with Chomsky, this film will give you a political perspective not easily found in the mainstream media. It's worth seeing for that alone.",
            "May have been more interesting if there were somebody from the Right responding to his views. It doesn't even have to be an equal to Chomsky - anyone will do.",
            "Whether one agrees with him totally, to some degree or not at all, it's hard not to appreciate the thoughtfulness of Noam Chomsky's gently spoken, hard-defended positions.",
            "Chomsky's rapier-sharp intelligence, his curmudgeonly wit, his goofy charisma -- not to mention his considerable political acumen -- are all but lost in this sometimes-lugubrious hodgepodge.",
            "Chomsky and his arguments are brilliant stuff, but this film is just a boring, trite mess.",
            "The authority of Chomsky's rhetoric has a sternly cleansing force that can't be dismissed.",
            "The kind of film that you hope makes it onto the TV screens of every high school class in the country.",
            "It is not a very distinguished film as documentaries go, but it captures the man in a vital moment -- commenting on America's place in the world following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.",
            "While that will ultimately give the film a dated feel in the future, right now it seems as topical and relevant as today's headlines.",
            "Would have been far more interesting if its titular talking head had debated an intellectual equal from the right.",
            "General outline of his critique of American power, which has been consistent since the early days of the Vietnam war.",
            "While he fails to offer any real solutions, his conscientious perspectives on the questions remain invaluable.",
            "The uninitiated heading to Film Forum might find it the best sawbuck they've spent all year.",
            "Chomsky delivers the sorts of lectures that intelligent but politically unformed college students with little sense of history are bound to love."

            "Even people who don't usually like Hugh Grant will be charmed by him in the scrappy, slightly scandalous comedy About a Boy.",
            "The directors Paul and Chris Weitz -- the American Pie brothers -- have tried hard not to make a tearjerker, and at its best the movie is knowing and tart.",
            "Mainstream comedies should all be this funny and tender and deftly performed.",
            "Hugh Grant hilariously redefines the word \"playboy\" in the first half of this film, then gets human, without losing his comic edge, under the influence of the title waif.",
            "About a Boy is better than a feelgood movie, it's a feelgreat movie -- genuinely clever, affecting when you least expect it to be and funny from start to finish.",
            "Compared to High Fidelity, the book and the movie, About A Boy seems resolutely uncool.... But part of growing up may be admitting that such familiar comforts can also be immensely satisfying.",
            "The splendid effectiveness of 'About a Boy' lies fully in the precise work of adaptation that the Weitz brothers make of the original text. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "In print. Hornby's story was lapped up by women. On screen, it looks likes the worst kind of unconvincing, unfelt schmaltz, and faintly misogynist in the subordination of its female characters to the needs of its male star. Come back, Richard Curtis.",
            "While the movie has some awkwardly executed scenes and slow spots... this is a comedy with a heart... It's funny, it's smart, it's poignant - and it's set on Planet Earth.",
            "...a thoroughly average piece of work...",
            "If the story gets dangerously thin, Grant is pretty well flawless. And Collette, always good, is heartbreakingly believable.",
            "About a Boy is truly a love story, with dialogue and a story line that's both pop and universally timeless, which is gold for moviegoers.",
            "This is a pleasingly skewed Britcom that can be watched with mates or the other half. And, boy, is it funny.",
            "Genuinely funny and moving, this is both an endearing examination of masculinity and a challenge to male isolationism.",
            "Grant's puckishness has become overly packaged; what's new about him here is his spiky hairdo. This movie is built on an actor as well as a character who is too intent to be on his best behavior.",
            "Grant, seeming to get better the further he's allowed to extend his range, delivers a terrific central performance, as acerbic but more complex than his sexy snake in Bridget Jones.",
            "About a Boy is an amusing film, full of bright lines and clever observation.",
            "This charming coming of age comedy, a tale with heart and social message, offers Hugh Grant his best role to date.",
            "Thankfully, this film is grounded and has a firm sense of reality and is consequently more affecting for it.",
            "Like Billy Wilder with a British bent, \"About a Boy\" lithely dances around uneasy comedy - attempted suicide, fragile kids of divorce, childhood bereft of memorable experiences. But it never trivializes them, emphasizing life's quality over its quantity.",
            "Grant grows a heart in Hornby-book pic; teens+.",
            "All in all, a nice breath of comedic fresh air as we get a witty, sweet, and hilarious British comedy with excellent performances from the versatile Hugh Grant and many others.",
            "Pleasant and engaging, rather than laugh-out-loud funny or emotionally involving.",
            "Few movies have made better use of Hugh Grant's shallow charm and amused befuddlement than this funny and well-paced adaptation of Nick Hornby's best-selling second novel."

            "Couples titillated by the possibility of swinging will probably leave the theater gripping each other's hands a little more tightly.",

            "Sylvie Testud gives such a ferociously controlled performance that the messy murder seems like a necessary release.",
            "Unfortunately Denis' detached and indifferent camera never gets inside the story, its characters, or its milieu.",
            "The film studies a world of deeply entrenched class divisions and sexual taboos, and then, with a scream in the night, draws the study to a close, leaving its meaning, like that of the case that inspired it, open to interpretation.",
            "Julie-Marie Parmentier and Sylvie Testud are eerily convincing as the intense pair of co-dependents in the rigorous but creepy drama Murderous Maids.",
            "Convincingly played, but some way short of revelatory.",
            "Never inspires more than an interested detachment.",
            "Constructing this story with sensitive slowness, Denis keeps the sensational aspects surrounding these incestuous lesbian sisters in check, letting a fantastic performance from Testud carry the movie.",
            "The acting is convincingly macabre, with Sylvie Testud giving an absolutely superb delirious performance.",
            "Good performances and a firm directing hand make this worthwhile despite the distasteful subject matter.",
            "Sylvie Testud is nothing less than ferocious...Even in her stillness, she's compelling.",
            "Its unevenness can be forgiven due to the boldness of dealing with such a taboo topic matter ,and despite all of its problems, this film makes for a fascinating 90 minutes.",
            "Newspaper stories or television coverage on murders far removed from the local scene accomplish as much, and are often as quickly forgotten",
            "provocative but a bit flat",
            "One wonders if they'll make similarly sympathetic films about O.J. Simpson in 70 years.",
            "Spare but quietly effective retelling.",
            "...salaciously simplistic.",
            "Highly recommended as an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it.",
            "Denis and co-writer Michele Petin's impeccable screenplay penetrates with a rawness that that is both unflinching and tantalizing. Lead provocatuers Testud and Parmentier give superlative performances",
            "The dreamy, almost poetic nature is entrancing.",
            "'The film is stark, straightforward and deadly... an unnatural calm that's occasionally shaken by...blasts of rage, and later, violent jealousy.'",
            "Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Murderous Maids is how restrained and sensitive French director Jean-Pierre Denis keeps his film.",
            "... a story, an old and scary one, about the monsters we make, and the vengeance they take.",
            "The weight of the piece, the unerring professionalism of the chilly production, and the fascination embedded in the lurid topic prove recommendation enough."

            "The result miraculously resurrects a seminal moment in rock history, elevating Ziggy Stardust into the landmark cultural event it always should have been. ",
            "Bowie knew how to play his audience, and the documentary shows him as a fiercely concentrated performance artist on and offstage, who micromanaged everything from his makeup palette to the length of his kimono sleeves.",
            "While the likes of 'Oh You Pretty Things' and 'All the Young Dudes' still raise a smile, the presiding image is of those flesh-crawling glam-rock costumes and stage antics. Go for the music, or not at all.",
            "Viewers only familiar with this glam-rock period from recent movies such as Hedwig and the Angry Inch and The Velvet Goldmine will be intrigued to discover this historical moment in all its flamboyant glory.",

            "This film is a piece of cultural memorabilia that, more so than capturing a significant concert, recreates what being David Bowie was at that time, and above all, looking at him. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Indisputably one of the greatest concert films ever made, DA Pennebaker's striking work captures those last moments onstage in all their glory.",
            "Bowie keeps the movie out of the doldrums of being just a home video, and it's a sight that deserves viewing for fans of rock and roll.",
            "While \"Ziggy\" is obviously more of interest to hardcore Bowie fans than anyone else (some critics have trashed it for that reason), it should be required viewing for rockers-in-training who really want to learn about good showmanship.",
            "Certainly of interest, if only for its vintage. But the film is drab and slight.",
            "Freed of the unflattering contemporary distractions offered by This Is Spinal Tap, Pennebaker's Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars captures Bowie at perhaps his purest, punkiest rock 'n' roll peak.",
            "The concert remains more of an historical curiosity than a must-see rock film.",
            "A colorful snapshot of an early chapter in the story of an accomplished performer.",
            "Like a flopped anecdote, Pennebaker's disappointing movie can be shrugged off with one line: You had to be there.",
            "The definitive portrait of the artist as a fruity vamp in a candy-striped jumpsuit pretending to be a rock star from another planet.",
            "Pennebaker doesn't break any ground here, in what is essentially a linear concert film. But he doesn't need to. Bowie's brilliant -- and, by today's stadium-size standards, intimate -- performance does that for him.",
            "An excellent example of its genre, with Pennebaker capturing the excitement of what was a very special, emotion-charged occasion.",

            "There's a sugar coating to the way Papale's story unfolds, but not so much that you'll spoil your dinner.",

            "I wonder how many more of these inspirational sports films we have to sit through in 2006.",
            "Screenwriter Brad Gann shares the guilt for this predictable cinematic travesty along with composer Mark Isham whose bombastic musical score is akin to hammering a nail with a shotgun blast.",

            "Cedar takes a very open-minded approach to this sensitive material, showing impressive control, both visually and in the writing.",
            "Just as the recent Argentine film Son of the Bride reminded us that a feel-good movie can still show real heart, Time of Favor presents us with an action movie that actually has a brain.",

            "A good thriller.",
            "Earnest but heavy-handed.",
            "Time of Favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation.",
            "Places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting, and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller.",
            "I enjoyed Time of Favor while I was watching it, but I was surprised at how quickly it faded from my memory.",
            "This fascinating look at Israel in ferment feels as immediate as the latest news footage from Gaza and, because of its heightened, well-shaped dramas, twice as powerful.",
            "One of the most successful, provocative and intensely contemporary of Israeli films, so much so that to watch it is to feel the country having a passionate argument with itself.",
            "Packs a considerable wallop.",
            "Cedar somewhat defuses this provocative theme by submerging it in a hoary love triangle.",
            "The package in which this fascinating -- and timely -- content comes wrapped is disappointingly generic.",
            "What distinguishes Time of Favor from countless other thrillers is its underlying concern with the consequences of words and with the complicated emotions fueling terrorist acts.",

            "This is really just another genre picture.",
            "Moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance."

            "The loneliness, guilt and impotence on Brody's face is haunting. His performance is extraordinary.",
            "Not a celebration of the human spirit, neither demonizing the Germans nor lionizing the Jews, resisting both deceptive moral uplift and despairing moral nihilism, The Pianist is a work of exquisite restraint.",
            "The Pianist is a far greater film than Polanski's recent variable track record suggested it might be, a work of sustained tension and ferocious clarity, and as near-perfect a marriage of subject and artist as could be imagined.",
            "The real value here can be found in director Roman Polanski's haunting, harrowing tribute to the uniquely human instinct for survival.",
            "Roman Polanski's \"The Pianist\" is the director's finest achievement, and elevates Adrien Brody (Oscar win for Best Actor 2002) to eminence in his representation of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew who survived the Nazi occupation of Warsaw.",

            "By comparison, Schindler's List is Pretentious Hollywood crap.",
            "The Pianist is a serious movie brought out in a tabloid-besotted time, a prestige picture that invigorates, a study of character and history that knows irony to be a part of life and not the purpose of art.",
            "I get the feeling that Polanski is expressing through this movie how he deals with such painful scars, haunting memories, and lasting grief.",
            "Polanski, like so many performers and artists' managers of the present day, makes the classic mistake of not trusting the art.",
            "As a result of the attention to detail and commitment of Polanski and Brody, this is a harrowing, realistic story of what it was like to live in the Warsaw Ghetto and under Nazi occupation.",
            "As someone whose Holocaust memories are burned into his psyche, Polanski finds the no-frills truth in this devastated landscape. ",
            "I'm not sure if the problem is a lack of connecting episodes or the inability to perfect Adrien Brody as a spellbinding figure of solitude. Whatever the deficiency, the movie feels exhausted well before its footage reaches a fade-out."

            "It's a rosy coming-of-age romp that refuses to see the horror even in the severed heads from the guillotine.",
            "This Sade is hardly a perverse, dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama. He's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery, and the film seems as deflated as he does.",
            "If you're looking for a smart, nuanced look at de Sade and what might have happened at Picpus, Sade is your film.",
            "Lacks dramatic punch and depth.",
            "[A] treacherously seductive and highly disturbing film...",
            "A fiercely clever and subtle film, capturing the precarious balance between the extravagant confidence of the exiled aristocracy and the cruel earnestness of the victorious revolutionaries.",
            "This time out, [Sade] is an unsettlingly familiar figure -- in turns loyal and deceitful, responsible and reckless, idealistically selfless and coldly self-interested.",
            "The Marquis de Sade couldn't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be.",
            "The reason to see \"Sade\" lay with the chemistry and complex relationship between the marquis (Auteil) and Emilie (Le Besco).",
            "Featuring a dangerously seductive performance from the great Daniel Auteuil, \"Sade\" covers the same period as Kaufmann's \"Quills\" with more unsettlingly realistic results.",
            "More concerned with Sade's ideas than with his actions. The movie achieves as great an impact by keeping these thoughts hidden as... [Quills] did by showing them.",
            "The movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man.",
            "There has always been something likable about the Marquis de Sade.",
            "It's a decent glimpse into a time period, and an outcast, that is no longer accessible, but it doesn't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor.",
            "The movie is as far as you can get from racy, to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain; it has a dull, costumey feel.",
            "Sade achieves the near-impossible: It turns the Marquis de Sade into a dullard.",
            "Sade is an engaging look at the controversial eponymous and fiercely atheistic hero.",
            "In its quiet, literate way, the film is almost as subversive as its central character.",
            "Director of photography Benoit Delhomme shot the movie in delicious colors, and the costumes and sets are grand."

            "The real star of the film, perhaps, is Christoph Waltz.",

            "The evening dissolves into irrational outbursts tinged with misogyny, homophobia and racism.",

            "As painful as it was for the two couples in this story to meet and spend, it seems, 80 minutes together, it was even more brutal for the audience.",
            "Smart, dark, uncomfortable yet somehow endlessly watchable.",
            "Carnage is,... worth seeing for Jodie Foster's first major performance in years. As a woman utterly convinced of her own superiority and righteousness, Foster gives us a very welcome reminder of her talent and her fearlessness.",

            "Shot on High Definition video, this exceptionally well-made but exceedingly bleak peek at tinseltown would be unbearable were it not for the sympathetic performance of Danny Huston... ",
            "The fascination comes in the power of the Huston performance, which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile, and in the way the Ivan character accepts the news of his illness so quickly but still finds himself unable to react.",
            "It's hard to say who might enjoy this, are there Tolstoy groupies out there? It's dark and tragic, and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death",
            "It gets onto the screen just about as much of the novella as one could reasonably expect, and is engrossing and moving in its own right.",

            "It's \"Bowfinger\" with a meaning, it's \"The Player\" with a heart, it's a window into business, politics and excesses. The film has heart",
            "With very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like Swimming With Sharks and The Player, this latest skewering ... may put off insiders and outsiders alike.",
            "To the degree that ivans xtc. works, it's thanks to Huston's revelatory performance.",
            "The reality-TV-like camera work takes some getting used to. And the even shakier editing, dialogue and acting quickly reveal this isn't exactly summer's big blockbuster.",

            "The pleasure of watching Affleck forcibly relieved of his security and complacency will be relished by anyone who enjoyed seeing Cary Grant sullying his suit in North by Northwest...",
            "\"Changing Lanes\" asks how far we'd go not to lose what's ours, but it's a morality play with hope for d\u00e9tente rather than any destructive force. Gavin and Doyle are two severely flawed men whose best intentions are knocked about by their worst impulses.",
            "Evitando o manique\u00edsmo, o roteiro cria dois personagens complexos e amb\u00edguos ao mesmo tempo que recheia a narrativa com di\u00e1logos bem constru\u00eddos e instigantes.",

            "How often do you go to a Hollywood movie and still find yourself thinking about it on the way to work the next day?",

            "Inside the film's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out, but it's not that, it's the tension that keeps you in your seat. Affleck and Jackson are good sparring partners.",

            "Later does a lot of things right, which makes its third-act missteps even more frustrating.",

            "28 Days Later unfolds as agripping suspense film punctuated by gruesome violence.",
            "The vanished London society that Cillian Murphy wakes up to at the start of this movie is one of the most brilliantly staged horror movie openings ever, and the survivalist battle that closes it caps a powerful story of disease paranoia. ",
            "It really touched on something that nobody had ever tackled before and did it in such a modern way... I was really impressed. ",
            "Boyle is perfect for the job because he's not big on reassurance; by taking the radical step of letting the movie's low-budget grime get under your skin, he gives the zombie picture new life.",

            "28 Days Later is a mind-bending look at a future one hopes never happens.",
            "This Dogme-driven apocalyptic nightmare from director Danny Boyle is a tense, exciting and terrifying horror.",
            "The picture is twitchy and annoying, flecked with blood and half-digested ideas, and too much is left unexplained.",
            "A crude but sometimes startling serving of schlock, the velocity and ferocity compensating for leaden conversation and smudge-o-vision photography.",
            "The film doesn't confine itself to wry satire -- it's an effective action adventure and an emotional journey for its protagonist Jim.",
            "Danny Boyle's purposeful direction and Mark Tildesley's imaginative and resourceful production design keep this fresh and edgy; the images of a wasted London and the details of a paramilitary organization in the countryside are both creepy and persuasive.",
            "What also makes 28 Days Later effective, and sets it apart from other thrillers, is that it makes you care about the characters."

            "Sure, he directs the heck out of gun battles and hand-to-hand combat, paying loving attention to each grunt, spurt and grimace, but there is something unseemly about the agony of war serving as fodder for yet another of Woo's sensational spectacles.",
            "While some may have used this fascinating subject matter to craft a serious drama with historical significance, Woo and his writers choose instead to stay with the high-octane action format.",
            "What should be a moving story with spectacular battle scenes by one of the world's greatest action directors is a huge let-down.",

            "A vigorous 20th installment that is as strong on action as it is weak on the interpersonal stuff.",
            "Sadly, the introductory scene is far better than anything else in the picture; it desperately deserves a grander movie to herald.",
            "This film is bad - seriously and shockingly bad.",
            "Die Another Day is a tale of two halves, the first half is mostly good, the second is nearly always awful. This is how Pierce Brosnan's Bond goes out, which is a damn shame.",
            "With work like this, I'm sure #21 can't be too far behind. Thank goodness Brosnan isn't ready to throw in the towel yet. Better keep those martinis comin' folks. And make that shaken, not stirred.",
            "this incarnation of Bond is just plain fun",
            "Plenty entertaining, but consistent with most of Brosnan's Bonds, a few misguided decisions keep it from being a classic.",
            "By honoring the Bond iconography of girls, guns and cars, Tamahori and the screenwriters are able to do something new with Bond: They dare to suggest that Bond is not only human, but also fallible.",
            "Die Another Day faithfully hews to the James Bond formula, giving us all the elements and allowing the '60s formula to not only live, but prosper, into the the new millennium.",
            "Tamahori senses what Bond fans have been missing. He and Brosnan deliver it with style, both deserving to try another day.",
            "Adding to the grimness: The title song is from Madonna, a dreary bit of lightweight electro-pop that goes on and on to little effect.",
            "James Bond gets bad news in Die Another Day: They've rescinded his license to kill. The news is worse for us. They've given him license to bore.",
            "By the end of Die Another Day, the character's potential to wind up beaten and broken has vanished amid the pixels and laser beams.",
            "Perhaps it's time to say goodbye to Mr. Bond.",
            "Pierce Brosnan is the best Bond since Sean Connery -- and this is the best Bond movie since Connery's run.",
            "While the franchise's twentieth entry... is certainly not vintage Bond, it does come equipped with the requisite supply of furious action and, in Oscar-winner Halle Berry, perhaps the highest-profile Bond Girl in the franchise's history.",
            "One of these decades someone will make a Bond as good as the titles and the theme music and the martini-ordering. In the meantime, enjoy the accessories.",
            "No one's going to accuse DIE ANOTHER DAY of being a sophisticated spy movie. It's an over-the-top action movie that is to be enjoyed best with a big bucket of popcorn."

            "The Divine Secrets Of The Ya-Ya Sisterhood was a little ahead of its time... it dreamed big, floundered and eventually petered out, making way for better versions of itself. But that doesn't mean it wasn't important.",
            "Chick flick for mom; teens may not enjoy it.",
            "While there are pleasures to be had from watching so many grand actresses strut their stuff, the fact is that the overriding preoccupation here rests with surface impressions rather than psychological probity.",
            "Better make the most of the first ten minutes of this execrable melodrama (directed by the scriptwriter of Thelma & Louise), because from then on it's the yackety-yack sisterhood in spades.",
            "What have we done to deserve this treacly, badly-acted nonsense? Whose children have we run over in a previous life?",
            "The result is far from convincing -- though its sentimental melodrama may appeal to women of a certain age who are looking for an alternative to bingo.",
            "You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll forgive your own mother (well, maybe). Bottom line - you can't help by go ga-ga for Ya-Ya.",
            "Sandra Bullock is great as Siddalee Walker, the angry and disgruntled woman who has a cross to bear with her mother and often exhibits the corky odd traits her mother does.",
            "I heard something in the audience for Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood I don't hear often any more: the sound of middle-aged women laughing.",
            "...if you plan on having a man watch this film with you, do him a favor...and don't.",
            "Seeing the film, my initial, gut perception of those who form real life Ya-Ya Sisterhoods stands: these are women with way too much time on their hands.",
            "There are some truly great actresses in this movie, but nearly all of them are wasted playing caricatures.",
            "Though [Khouri] has an obvious flair for exploring the inner workings of the female mind, she unfortunately glosses over a pinnacle moment in the story and inevitably lets the viewer down.",
            "That such strong, capable women are called on to carry a film as shoddy as Ya-Ya in front of and from behind the camera is hardly progress. ",
            "A tal irmandade Ya-Ya \u00e9 de uma bobagem extremada, e o roteiro tem buracos incr\u00edveis, deixando de lado v\u00e1rios pontos sobre os irm\u00e3os de Burstyn e Bullock, que s\u00e3o mencionados, mas nunca vistos.",
            "...it becomes clear that these two hours would be better spent reflecting on our own treasured memories than getting confused by this group's sordid past.",
            "...Mostly a load of pretentious crap, but it has its moments.",
            "Since, at least as relates to its central plot, Ya-Ya cheerleads for the pure life-living gusto of its gaudy heroines, some spirited overacting and slathery screenwriting is less a liability than a guilty pleasure the movie is wholly in on.",
            "It is the actresses' irreproachable ability to tap into the feminine psyche, to capture the beauty of female friendships and to demonstrate the complex love and loathe relationship often found between mothers and daughters that elevates this movie.",
            "Cross-generational mother-daughter drama is a little familiar, but it'll still warm your heart.",
            "Well-made, but frequently boring and predictable drama -- a couple of decent performances but the climax doesn't work and it's all been done better elsewhere.",
            "With an assist from screenwriter Mark Andrus, and judicious borrowing from the follow-up novel Little Altars Everywhere, Ms. Khouri has tamed Rebecca Wells' sprawling narrative without sacrificing its emotional riches.",
            "For all the quirky behaviour on display, there is still no personality, merely 'issues', their resolutions and a lot of frickin' ya-yas.",

            "A cold war thriller told from the Russian point of view which gives it the appearance of having more credibility and dark truth than if this were an American story."

            "Enthralled by his own genius and desire to make another blockbuster, Shyamalan has taken a terrific B-movie idea and inflated it into what he wants us to believe is a serious commentary on faith.",
            "Signs manages to be creepy, emotional, and thrilling all at once.",
            "Shyamalan may not be Hitchcock hut so far he's made the best 1950s B-movie of the 21st century.",
            "Shyamalan is 0 for 3, giving us another incredible movie.",
            "An anti-Independence Day, a cousin of Close Encounters, but most of all, a well-modulated, dread-laden, faith-based mystery. [Blu-Ray]",

            "The one good thing about it is that it's over in one hour and 47 minutes. The bad thing is to think what a terrible waste it was of an hour and 47 minutes.",

            "It wasn't a bad idea to conceive of the film as an epic, complex love story between Frida and Rivera, but the passion between them is more rhetorical than palpable...Taymor and Hayak give us only the rough sketch of a wild soul.",
            "It would be nice to report that the subsequent film, with all of the talent and perseverance that has gone into seeing it to fruition, was worth the heartfelt efforts of all involved.",

            "[A]s in soap opera, drama is synonymous with the torments of love. Hayek is a brave, tireless performer, ... but given the script she can only play Kahlo the \"beguiling personality\" she liked to think of herself as ... rather than Kahlo the artist.",

            "One Hour Photo is a very well-made thriller. It shows us Robin Williams extending his acting range into unusual and disturbing material. And as well as causing acute anxiety in its last reels, it delivers a more moral message than most of its kind.",
            "Intensely scary thriller; not for every teen.",
            "This immaculately made first feature from noted musicvid and commercials director Mark Romanek provides Robin Williams with one of his creepiest, atypical roles, and the comic star responds with an unusually restrained performance...",
            "It has arresting things to say about how the family photo is used less to record than to project, and how far that projection can be from the truth.",
            "Williams gives quite a performance. It's as if he's turned himself into a negative of his usual chipper self.",
            "Former video director Mark Romanek has written and directed a very entertaining, if overdesigned movie.",
            "Not a pretty picture, but you won't be able to take your eyes off it.",
            "Robin Williams' finest performance remains valid and extremely creepy even after fifteen years. [Full review in Spanish].",
            "While honoring the suspense-building engine of a thriller, One Hour Photo creates a nightmare portrait of American life.",
            "Robin Williams makes this movie what it is with his uncomfortably fearless portrayal of the wimpish Sy the Photo Guy, giving us the creepiest, most spine tingling, heebie-jeebie making film of the year.",
            "A film that over the years I've come to appreciate far more than my initial viewing due to the brilliant, unforgettable effort by Robin Williams who gives one of his most haunting performances.",
            "Without Robin Williams, 'One Hour Photo' is just another predictable B movie thriller. He's like that slow train wreck, personified, that people can't seem to take their eyes off.",
            "Robin Williams gets a chance to stretch as an actor in this semi-effective thriller.",
            "this film shows that Williams can slither into the blacks and grays of the psyche",
            "Call it an exercise in threat management, free with the purchase of a photo album--or a movie ticket.",
            "This is a brilliant, incredibly directed film with excellent performances all around from Nielsen, and Williams who deserves an Oscar nod.",
            "In a story so reliant on detail as the engine for character action, it's frustrating and annoying to see the film spiral down the gurgler because of a few (but crucial) lapses of attention to detail.",
            "Robin Williams creates a character who earns our revulsion--and somehow also our sympathy.",
            "Sy is a complete character with a physicality, inner monologue and motivation that we haven't seen from Mr. Williams in a long time. And it's a pleasure to watch.",
            "This story begs for a harder focus, the kind of thing Stanley Kubrick was always good at, at least until he got a little too focused. What saves the film is Robin Williams in a very atypical role.",
            "This is not the Robin Williams you are used to seeing.",
            "What brings the film to a level beyond is Williams's superb performance and, in turn, Romanek's carefully calibrated direction.",
            "A music video is like espresso: a lot of visual power compressed into five minutes. A movie needs to know something of the rhythms of everyday life, or else the audience get dizzy and exhausted."

            "The body-doubling and face-pasting are unfortunately blatant.",

            "In a 40-year career in horror, David Cronenberg never dreamed up an image as chilling or stomach-churning as Dana Carvey as a human turtle.",
            "A film about as funny as a seeping wound.",
            "Such a sad irony that Dana Carvey, who's made his name bringing celebrities to life with uncanny impersonations, should make such a lifeless movie based on characters of his own creation.",
            "A messy disappointment for Dana Carvey fans.",
            "... Mike Myers has already milked this type of gag-dense character comedy bone dry.",
            "George W. Bush in the flesh would have been much funnier than this movie's impersonation.",
            "While some of the make-up effects are mildly diverting (Carvey disguises himself as a turtle and a cherry pie), they hardly make up for the lame screenplay, barely coherent plot and increasingly desperate mugging.",
            "If Carvey's looking for a comeback, then playing a cloying dimwit with an annoying accent isn't the place to start.",
            "The humor here is relentlessly juvenile, and not even the kids in the audience seemed to like it much.",
            "It is not as funny as it could be, and none of it makes sense, especially Pistachio's ability to mimic any dialect but standard US English. But his versatility is astonishing.",
            "This is a bad flick that will appeal mostly to kids ranging from ages 5-11, but adults will leave halfway through. I found it almost tolerable.",
            "This misfiring disaster shows just how over-estimated Carvey's writing and acting talent has been.",
            "There follows a fusillade of farts, dud sight gags and inconsequential butt jokes.",
            "Master of Disguise may be a real hoot, if you're under 10 years old, or drunk, or both. Not a bad time-waster on a rainy Sunday, but a time-waster nonetheless.",
            "It is virtually impossible to watch The Master of Disguise and not feel embarrassed for stars Dana Carvey, Jennifer Esposito, and Brent Spiner.",
            "In the end, Dana Carvey is left wishing he could disguise himself as Mike Myers, or himself circa 1986. At least then, he would be funny again.",
            "The worst film ever made: a film about idiots, made by idiots, for idiots.",
            "The fart jokes get the biggest laughs.",
            "...Occasional moments of Carvey genius (many of which are seen in the trailer) sprinkled sparsely throughout a senseless, leaden production...",
            "It is cut with all the precision and timing of an irritating kids' TV show, with kids themselves in charge of the production, and their pets operating the equipment.",
            "In the dire The Master of Disguise, Carvey is seen to maximum disadvantage as a dim-witted Italian-American waiter whose family have an inherited gift for turning themselves into anyone from Bo Derek to George Bush.",
            "This is a serious contender for the title of The Worst Film Ever Made.",
            "It's a great, resonant comic premise, yet the film fails on every level, partly due to Carvey's charmless passive-aggressive manner - lacking the abrasive edge of Lewis or Adam Sandler, he's nakedly winsome, a puppy yapping for love.",
            "Never have so many jokes clunked off the screen to such a silent audience. And never has 80 minutes seemed like such an eternity."

            "Seriously, rent the Disney version.",
            "Adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like Pinocchio. As for children, they won't enjoy the movie at all.",
            "It's a frightful vanity film that, no doubt, pays off what debt Miramax felt they owed to Benigni.",
            "If you saw Benigni's Pinocchio at a public park, you'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police."
