            "Guan goes hammer and tongs with the special effects, delivering stupendously, joint-rattlingly-loud battle scenes and combat sequences edited to the lightning pace of a superhero movie.",
            "The Eight Hundred is thin on characterization, and too often slips into rote narrative and war movie cliches.",
            "[A]t least those who like blunt metaphors with their war movies will get a kick out of Hu's most blatant device: a majestic white horse that the NRA lets gallop through the warehouse as if rubber-stamped with the words \"hope.\"",
            "Plunges audiences into both the intimacy and magnitude of brutal war spectacle while immersing them in a stunningly mounted period canvas.",
            "As bombastic and melodramatic as one might expect it to be, &#65279;The Eight Hundred is also relentlessly thrilling, and exquisitely photographed on huge, practical sets.",
            "The scale and period detail are often jaw dropping. The carnage is massive and the unflinching brutality of the fighting includes some hard-to-watch scenes where soldiers are forced at gunpoint by a sadistic commander to execute prisoners.",
            "The benefit is a quite overwhelming, palpable realism.",
            "It serves as a big-budget corrective to myths about war generated by Western cinema, such as the idea that Asians stood by to watch while Westerners fight their battles.",
            "There's never a dull moment over the long running time.",
            "The absence of any well-developed characters makes The Eight Hundred a hollow experience, and one which only delivers a long two and a half hours of empty sound and fury.",

            "We watch them stand for their country amid the gore-soaked horror of war, with action filmed up close, with amazing aerial shots, and inside various environments that dazzle the eyes.",
            "\"Overall, the film is still worth a watch if you're interested in Chinese history and politics. If the political message doesn't interest you, at least The Eight Hundred has decent special effects amidst explosions and gun battles.\"",
            "The Eight Hundred is a great story depicting the Chinese front.",
            "Digging past the surface morale boosting, you will find a darker story.",
            "An entertaining, thought at times taxing, experience that succeeds at once as being a distinctive yet conventional entrant in the war film genre.",
            "At its heart, The Eight Hundred is the kind of rousing war story we're used to seeing out of Britain and America, full of heroism, sacrifice, and baby-faced soldiers who go beyond the call of duty.",
            "A film with ambitions as wide as the screen it should be seen on, it uses expert craftsmanship to tell a story of war heroism and patriotism that is both intimately familiar and somehow foreign to U.S. audiences",
            "The Eight Hundred ... has a definite moral problem, and the movie's jingoism is most definitely at the core of that problem."

            "Much like July's previous features, Kajillionaire is a movie full of bizarre and eccentric moments. But deep down, what July offers here is a tender and moving story about love and our needs for connection, with a phenomenal performance from Wood.",
            "The film continues July's exploration of connection, and the yearning for intimacy, upending and queering the myth of family while exploring possibilities for those cut adrift from society's norms.",
            "With her tart-sweet worldview and keen sense of the ridiculous, filmmaker Miranda July spins straw into tender threads of gold.",
            "Reaches quite moving levels of resonance as it engages with the idea of a young adult dealing with a lifetime of parental neglect (and worse).",
            "A quirky and peculiar film whose aesthetic surface masks a deeply moving emotional core. Anxiety ridden, but a ride worth the ensuing catharsis.",

            "Hope Gap is the occasion for a volcanically bitter performance from Bening. But it is otherwise prey to all the errors of pseudo-taste to which stage adaptations are prone...",
            "What's somehow radical here, however, is the way the film mostly follows Grace's point of view, and she is a difficult creature, hard to empathise with. But she is both magnificent and awful in a scene in a solicitor's office.",
            "Nicholson has form with writing later-life relationships, so it's a shame that the real hope gap here is that between expectation and reality.",
            "The performances are terrific, especially from Bening who adds yet another deeply nuanced study to her gallery of complicated, smart women of a certain age.",

            "Michael Matthews' \"Love and Monsters\" is the rarest kind of movie these days: A fun, imaginative, genre-mashing adventure that was made with a modest amount of big studio money. ",
            "At times it is quite creative and others it feels way too familiar. While the monsters' very presence and actions don't make a lick of sense, they are at least uniquely conceived, even if the supporting characters are many times unnecessary formulaic...",
            "Though it's moderately likable throughout, only when \"Love and Monsters\" gets serious about the difficulties of Joel's situation does it feel genuinely relevant.",
            "An excellent display of O'Brien's infectious imagination and comic energy.",
            "An imaginative post-apocalyptic coming-of-age film...",
            "A happy-go-lucky adventure through an apocalyptic danger zone.",

            "More eye-catching than cerebral, this feel-good fantasy, conceived and co-written by Brian Duffiels, provides an amusing session. ",
            "Nothing too original there, and the CGI-heavy effects go only so far, but we have Dylan O'Brien's semi-can-do hero seeking his love Jessica Henwick when venturing outside invites the subterranean worst of Tremors or Dune.",
            "Fun escapism. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)",
            "A monster movie, a quest adventure, a semi-romance, and a bunch of laughs. What's not to like?",
            "... embraces the inherent absurdity in its premise with an appealing playfulness.",

            "Charming post-apocalyptic adventure is filled with suspense. ",
            "In 2020, it's difficult not to see things through a pandemic lens - but the final scenes of Love and Monsters gave me such a visceral reaction that I could not quite comprehend that I was getting that emotional during a film called Love and Monsters.",

            "There's a warm, odd kind of comfort here...It's not 100% natural, but it's close enough to pass for it when it hits the brain like a pleasant memory."

            "In her unusual and vivid directorial debut Shannon Murphy has that knack of framing something mundane to make it look somehow distanced and other-worldly, aided by director of photography, Andrew Commis.",
            "Milla might be dying but she's also, paradoxically, finding her way in the world and working out what she wants, even if time is short.",
            "Scanlen (last seen as the similarly doomed Beth in Greta Gerwig's adaptation of Little Women) does good work, but the film remains curiously subdued when it should be alive to the intensity of everything Milla is going through.",

            "One applauds Murphy's desire to skip all the bucket-list clich\u00e9s of the terminal-disease drama, but you wonder whether there is much on screen besides oodles of mercurial technique. Dying never looked like so much fun.",
            "Shannon Murphy's debut feature is full of extraordinary performances - Scanlen and Wallace are outstanding - but the initial brilliance and pace aren't sustained.",
            "Ultimately Babyteeth is a visceral and challenging coming of age story that reminds us all that we shouldn't take life for granted. It is filled with humour and great acting and should be watched by all "

            "Followed offers frightening scares mixed with some social commentary on media use. It is a modern and much needed spin on the found footage sub-genre of horror."

            "The better way to come close to an understanding of who The Band was is to re-watch The Last Waltz instead.",
            "In most ways, the film is a conventional rock doc, a nostalgic and valorizing chronicle of a group's rise and fall. The Band is one group that deserves the deep dive.",
            "Robertson is chasing something different here - a fond remembrance of the complicated friendships lost along the way that celebrates the good times through the music they created while they could.",
            "Even at its most painful, the Band's story captures something golden, incendiary and wistfully beautiful - \"so beautiful,\" Robertson reflects, \"that it went up in flames.\"",

            "A little more investigative journalism would have given this documentary a more well-rounded variety of perspectives. Ultimately though, the music and talent of [Robbie] Robertson and The Band are the real attractions for this movie. ",
            "The documentary has a focus that other nonfiction music bios lack.",
            "Once Were Brothers: Robbie Robertson and the Band is a loving tribute to its subjects - which is both a blessing and a curse. ",
            "One of the most entertaining cautionary tales in recent memory, a quality that is likely to land it on a host of top film lists (mine included).",
            "Full of gorgeous archival footage and genuinely soul-stirring music, \"Once Were Brothers\" is involving from start to finish.",
            "Even if \"Once Were Brothers\" is tilted toward Robertson's version of events, it, nevertheless, makes compelling viewing.",
            "The group will remain most famous for the great 1978 Martin Scorsese rock-doc, \"The Last Waltz\"; while this is nowhere on par with that, it provides a valuable look into the group's origins, dynamics and the making of that great Scorsese film. ",
            "It has great performance footage, interesting talking heads, and freighted music. It feels sentimental and bittersweet, with Robertson coming across as a thoughtful, respectful, vaguely professorial figure.",
            "Like similar music docs, Once Were Brothers relies heavily on archival footage, familiar photographs, and outtakes from photography shoots. ... Yet, the beauty of Rohr's documentary is how engagingly he arranges it.",
            "\"Once Were Brothers\" is a moving cautionary tale and an important piece of music history, but it's in the pure joy of such moments that The Band is best remembered. ",
            "It's the stories about recording The Band's first few albums that are the most interesting, especially when you consider that Robertson was Canadian but he still managed to capture the spirit of American roots rock.",
            "Mostly, the documentary conveys the way The Band, a product of the '60s, stood both inside and outside the culture of the time. ",
            "A profile of the Band as heartwarming as it is heartbreaking.",
            "\"Once Were Brothers\" would appear to be a final attempt by Robertson to clear his name and tell his side of the story, but this is ultimately Robertson's ode to his band of brothers, and as such, it is moving, tragic, and yet also celebratory and joyous.",
            "In many ways, it's a fun journey down memory lane, but at the same time, it's aggravatingly self-serving.",
            "Besides the music -- with, naturally, key inclusions of \"Up on Cripple Creek\" and a rousing finale of \"The Weight\" -- celebrity talking heads abound.",
            "Robertson, mostly sitting alone, talks to the camera and it works, along with the archival footage and interviews with the iconic rock stars who credit the band with their inspiration and influence. "

            "To recreate the gossipy Manhattan arena that Capote navigated with such ease and documented with such malice, you need dialogue that rings like scatter-shot and the film's script, written by its director Douglas McGrath, doesn't have it.",

            "a horror movie which reduces its central fear to the most fundamental form of existential dread.",
            "Alternately hilarious and spine-tingling, it recalls David Lynch's Twin Peaks in its serious, penetrating sense of doom.",
            "Does it amount to more than that experiment -- a cinematic, sensory exercise in portraying existential dread in a heightened way that reflects a universal human experience? I'm not sure it does. But maybe that should be enough.",
            "The characters are just awful. Superficial, inarticulate, mewling dolts. So odious, in fact, that you wonder if this is satire.",
            "From the opening scenes, Seimetz and her clever ensemble cast have fun with the weighty conceit and post-Malick somnambulism. ",

            "Amy Seimetz's film is a powerful, unshakeable slice of horror cinema. This is a grand, great film, one that feels all too relatable, and is all too proud for knowing that too.",

            "The kind of film that feels deeply personal in different ways to different people. It's a weirdly funny and unconventional watch, often gripping but eventually unsatisfying.",
            "This works almost better as an actors' workshop than as a work of horror... They all shine, because they're given room to shine and an irresistible chunk of dramatic meat to gnaw on. ",
            "She Dies Tomorrow is a crowning achievement of cinematic self-reflection.",
            "She Dies Tomorrow is at points a film about the way one deals with mortality, collective trauma and mass psychosis, making it an essential work of 2020 pop culture.",
            "Writer-director Amy Seimetz skilfully blurs the lines between comedy and horror, creating a story that eerily parallels the spread of a pandemic. It's an unusually unsettling movie, playing on deep-seated fears to scare the life out of us.",
            "This is experimental and existential horror ... serves up something transcendent and beautiful that will put your emotions through the ringer.",
            "Regrettably, the film's vagueness on its characters' actual fate is a bit too anticlimactic.",

            "To watch Tesla the film is to admire its ambition while regretting its follies. Much like Tesla the man, perhaps?",
            "It's definitely not for everyone, but I liked this so much more than just a by-the-numbers biopic.",
            "Someone as brilliant and creative as Tesla surely deserves a biopic that is not afraid to be unconventional or to swing for the fences, but in practice this just did not work for me at all. ",
            "For all its midway-ness and compromises, \"Tesla\" remains a more audacious and more curiosity-sparking movie than almost all of the bio-pics that come from Hollywood studios.",
            "The period details are spot on, the performances are sly and smart but the lack of a consistent tone hurts the movie in the end.",
            "Faced with the limitations of historical documentation of inventor Nikolai Tesla, director Michael Almereyda and actor Ethan Hawke choose instead to convey his spirit.",

            "It's not to say Tesla's story shouldn't be told, but here you have to do a lot of compensating to find some level of compelling enjoyment.",

            "Tesla feels like a biopic about the inventor's inventions, rather than the decisions and events that led the man towards becoming an inventor.",
            "Despite Hawke's mesmerizing performance, this anachronic and unconventional biopic doesn't live up to the legacy of its main character. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Hawke gives an inward-looking performance that emphasizes the alliance in Tesla of spiritual delicacy with globe-spanning ambition -- an uneasy combination, which led to what might be called, at a minimum, eccentricity and isolation.",
            "However, director Michael Almereyda had no intention of simply making a straightforward drama.",
            "Tesla's mystery is deepened by the film's outr\u00e9 aesthetic and narrative devices, and it all feels of a piece-not one that will appeal to everyone, especially those looking for a conventional biopic, but one that stays true to its own unique integrity.",
            "The result will hardly please fans of mainstream biographies... but it's also an exciting journey into the unknown, filled with curiosity and melancholy. [Full review in Spanish]",

            "With such a gorgeous world housing so many vibrant emotions, it's a particular frustration that Archive doesn't follow through on any of them.",
            "Archive is at its best when it leans into its machines and away from its lackluster leading man.",
            "Yet somehow, Rothery turns this all around in the last few minutes into something that left me genuinely stunned.",
            "A sleek and satisfying riff on familiar sci-fi themes.",
            "When Rothery's storytelling stalls... his filmmaking keeps things crisp and involving.",
            "Many changes come at the climax, and they are not all good.",
            "If viewers can stomach a lingering sense of familiarity, Archive offers a sturdy, slow-burn science fiction throwback. ",
            "Archive honors the great sci-fi visuals of the past and pushes modern sci-fi a little farther into the future. ",
            "Archive is a movie that works as both speculative science fiction and moving human drama. Fans of the genre will note that there's no contradiction in that.",
            "Archive isn't the first time this idea has come to the screen, but it makes for a reasonably compelling, if chilly, sci-fi tale in the mold of 2015's Ex Machina.",
            "With an incredible score by Steven Price, Archive has all of the right science fiction set ups and atmosphere, even if the dynamics are nothing new.",
            "Though it comprises familiar elements from many other sci-fi movies, this debut feature's appealing visual design and surprising emotional content are ultimately enough to make it worth a look. ",
            "The only reason to see this movie is because it's beautifully shot by Laurie Rose and has Oscar winning composer Steven Price dropping some slick beats. Other than those inspired choices, \"Archive\" is a basic upload.",
            "... flashes some low-budget visual flair, although the deliberately paced screenplay turns predictable in the second half, which compromises the intended emotional impact.",
            "My problem, however, is not so much with the lack of originality displayed by writer-director Gavin Rothery as it is with the fact that he pretty much fails to bring any kind of new spin to the material that might have helped it go down better. ",
            "The movie's elegant execution makes the old mysteries feel fresh again.",
            "To say that the actual finale of Archive is a disappointment would be an understatement.",
            "Gorgeously shot and production-designed to within an inch of its cinematic life, the film can't quite overcome a disappointing ending, yet stills sits with one long afterwards.",
            "Deliberately sidesteps exploring or examining the more troubling themes underlying AI . ",
            "Creates an engrossing study of human frailty and obsession, and Rothery shows some visual might with the picture.",
            "Archive is such a visually superb experience with subtle humor that keeps you interested and downright shocks in its final moments. A wonderfully vibrant and expertly captivating debut from a first time director with a ton of potential.",
            "Archive is a great sci-fi thriller that will have you trying to put the pieces together from beginning to end. It is a bit slow, but there really is a payoff in the end.",
            "A slick, moody sci-fi mashup, a thoughtful thriller cobbled together from a lot of better films that came before it."

            "Like the oily cakes Cookie and King-Lu create, the film's ingredients are simple, but the results are richly delectable and well worth coming back for seconds.",

            "I doubt I'll see a lovelier film in 2020.",
            "First Cow shows Kelly Reichardt at the height of her artistic and political powers, with supreme command over her own personal vision of American progress and its consequences.",
            "The latest release from ingenious director Kelly Reichardt is a brilliant and moving drama, but also an unusual one.",
            "In Reichardt's unsentimental hands, though, simplicity comes not as solace but rather as an unsweetened truth: today we reap the seeds of America's poisonous past.",
            "Nothing here is simple -- alliances are constantly shifting.",
            "[First Cow] never takes the easy way out... It is subtle, well-directed, and the cinematography is gorgeous.",

            "Moran's script is sharp on the particular dishonesty of 1990s sexism, glossed as it was with a wipe-clean coating of irony, and Feldstein makes an ebullient ringmaster.",
            "If it fails to mine the deeper themes in this story about a working-class writer fighting to find her footing in the music industry, How To Build A Girl is a resounding success as a showcase of Feldstein's capabilities in a leading role.",
            "Charming and witty, How to Build a Girl is a hugely likeable film which showcases Bearnie Feldstein's wonderful talents.",
            "Caitlin Moran's witty wordsmith wonder unleashes a whirlwind of ambitious thunder in Beanie Feldstein with a joyful trip to the 90s' sticking one finger up at sexist journalistic practices.",
            "It's disappointing that [Caitlin] Moran couldn't use her real-life experiences as a music journalist to write a more realistic screenplay ... How to Build a Girl wants to be edgy, but it's as edgy as a melted popsicle."

            "A gem that is profound and topical.",
            "Loosely structured, but satisfactory in its narrative shape, the picture deftly escorts us through the embarrassments and dilemmas of everyday life in a hipper part of Chicago. ",
            "Saint Frances is, above all else, an honest and intelligent film that offers a smart perspective on the pressures placed upon women in their thirties.",

            "For all the talk about when we're going to see the big films, one of the best is already on our doorstep.",
            "As the sunny days pass and Bridget finds herself sinking into the job of caring for Frances more than she imagined, the warmth trickles into the corners of the film leaving cynicism no place to lurk. ",

            "Gently observant, this warm comedy has a nicely brittle edge to it, infusing conversations with a terrific sense of honesty.",
            "Fresh, funny and frank, Saint Frances is a welcome shake-up of tired genre clich\u00e9s; a messy, uplifting story about a woman who may not have everything figured out, but is fully in charge of her own fate.",
            "[A]n edgy, keenly observed comedy with echoes of last year's Brittany Runs A Marathon, and, coincidentally, of Noah Baumbach's 2012 movie Frances Ha."

            "Peninsula was never going to reach the high bar set by Busan, and while it remains an intermittently thrilling chase movie, the fact that it's so formulaic and derivative dims your desire to see what other survivor stories might play out in this world.",
            "I... felt entirely dialed in to the breakneck action/adventure vibe Yeon was able to achieve with this film and it hit the spot in a most satisfactory way.",

            "Despite my issues with the film's structure and pacing, I still want to love it. I want to love it because I know Lee, Winslet, Ronan, and all the cast and crew poured their hearts and souls out into this. Every scene shows.",

            "Coming after the dissolute wackiness of Ludwig and the cavorting valedictory of Conversation Piece, Luchino Visconti's swan song L'Innocente is something of a genteel and stately affair."

            "It's disappointing that [Caitlin] Moran couldn't use her real-life experiences as a music journalist to write a more realistic screenplay ... How to Build a Girl wants to be edgy, but it's as edgy as a melted popsicle.",
            "A heartwarming, British coming-of-age story that deals with class, body positivity, and succeeding as a young woman in a man's world.",
            "This is easily Feldstein's breakout role. She's terrific and owns the screen. While she's been endearing in other roles, this movie sits entirely on her shoulders. ",

            "Even with so much spelled out, the significance of this very abstract parable will be best appreciated by the adults in the room, just as the trippy visuals (often quite imaginative) belong to the same tradition of knowingly warped storybook imagery.",
            "Trolls World Tour is clear on one thing: never should glitter and rainbows be automatically equated with brainlessness.",
            "I don't know if a six-year-old -- who the animation appears designed for in terms of style, brightness, and color -- would get any of the jokes, but as a person trapped in my house, I appreciated them.",
            "\"Trolls: World Tour\" is not a mindblowing cinematic achievement, but it is exactly what kids, and parents, need right now. That's where it hits the high note.",
            "The plot gives \"World Tour\" an opportunity to cycle through countless hits, and it does so so speedily that the film often feels less like a story than an impatient, candy-colored battle of the bands.",
            "Reader, I wept.",
            "There's a sweet message in this harmless hit-heavy kid and stoner friendly flick that features cool voice cameos, but it certainly won't be for everyone.",

            "The songs are kinda boring and the plot's pretty rote, but this film is shockingly beautiful and thought-through in all the design elements.",

            "Families are home craving content to entertain the kids. \"Trolls World Tour\" accomplishes this with flying colors (quite literally), as the folks at DreamWorks Animation turn an animated journey into a unique music history lesson.",
            "Trolls World Tour has a message that people can live peacefully while respecting each other's differences. It's a message that comes wrapped in a lot of musical numbers and action sequences, but it's something that audiences can take to heart. ",
            "... [Trolls World Tour] is truly confounding in the most positive, warm-hugging, high-fiving, responsibility-taking way. ... you've got the best seat anywhere in your house to go on this crazy journey into the history of Trolldom.",
            "There's just no heart, soul, or true purpose in this film; something generic and robotic about every aspect of its existence.",
            "All you can really say about Trolls World Tour is that it is a fun, but forgettable formulaic follow-up.",
            "Even more than the original, Trolls World Tour, is a rainbow-swathed, glitter-drenched escape from reality, and it provides the full-on fantastical at-home experience that many families are probably craving right now.",
            "Beats captures the highs and lows, the simultaneous hope and desolation, and, most of all, the wild, anarchic freedom of youth and having no idea what you're doing, but plowing full speed ahead, consequences be damned. ",
            "A nice, straightforward matinee offering for the kids and their families...not bad. Watch this to bring some brightness into your life right now...",

            "One of the nicest things to say about Trolls World Tour is that it moves pretty briskly. It's not particularly impactful, but it should be entertaining enough for young viewers.",
            "There are a few lines that will have you howling. I know they did me. You probably won't love the movie but at least those few lines and the positive message make it tolerable.",

            "You could also describe it as the missing link between Bridesmaids and Roma.",

            "O'Sullivan treats nothing glibly, yet everything can end up funny. Her way with a verbal faux pas is peerless.",

            "Saint Frances is, above all else, an honest and intelligent film that offers a smart perspective on the pressures placed upon women in their thirties.",

            "It's funny and heart-warming; revelatory and touching; and most of all, it's a rare miracle and one of the best movies of the year.",
            "Saint Frances isn't merely a sugary little comedy about a charming pairing. It has that kind of likability, but there's also immense frustration and sadness here too.",
            "For all the talk about when we're going to see the big films, one of the best is already on our doorstep.",
            "As the sunny days pass and Bridget finds herself sinking into the job of caring for Frances more than she imagined, the warmth trickles into the corners of the film leaving cynicism no place to lurk. ",

            "Valley Girl is an '80s artifact that either should have been given a more interesting makeover or been left untouched in the dustbin of the decade that spawned it.",
            "There are two key additions to the narrative this time around, both fairly disastrous.",
            "It's the classic girl falls for the boy from the wrong side of the tracks story with all of the teenage angst you could possibly want, wrapped up in a pretty and well-sung walk down memory lane.",
            "Almost everything about this musical smacks of an inauthentic, forced recreation of the effortless 1980s charm that made the original Valley Girl movie a cult classic.",
            "Valley Girl is a totally rad musical throwback to the eighties complete with a wonderful soundtrack and an astounding performance from Jessica Rothe. ",
            "With the chemistry and shameless nostalgia-grab of jazzercise, leg warmers, and 80s pop, there's enough to Valley Girl to entertain, although there's admittedly little there to impress.",
            "Overall it was a bubbly, effervescent fun film with a very likable leading presence from Jessica Rothe.",
            "Disney Channel style musical numbers give the story a propulsive energy but the artificial, generic tone also threatens to make the story weightless.",

            "Valley Girl is a blast of enjoyable camp that is, unlike its teenage protagonists, entirely sure of its own identity. It knows it's broad, silly and cheesy, but it embraces that and turns its fantasy elements up to 11",
            "Is Valley Girl true to its tagline, 'the awesomest love story ever told'? No. It's predictable with a familiar narrative and familiar conflicts, but it's feel-good and highlights not the stereotypes of the era, but its boisterous energy.",
            "Valley Girl isn't going to win any awards, but it's a lot more fun than expected, and if you're in the need of a pick-me-up, Valley Girl could totally provide it.",
            "If you're looking for a spirited diversion while holed up at home, Valley Girl is a great pick.",

            "Raiff's film is a DIY marvel.",
            "Through cinematographer Rachel Klein's intimate lens that values long takes and close-ups, Raiff on the whole transposes a youthful world on to the screen, adorned with profound existential worries of early adulthood.",
            "There's real potential in this scrappy first feature.",
            "Even decades later, one can clearly remember the highs and lows, the small joys and the big heartaches, and \"S-house\" brings them home - whether you like it or not.",
            "Raiff deserves credit for an unexpectedly elliptical coda, but much of the chatter between the leads has the emo-tedium of dorm room blather.",
            "The movie is refreshingly honest about the stresses and depression that can come with being young, male, and unmoored.",
            "It proves to be more sensitive than you would think from its vulgar title.",
            "What makes the film work as well as it does, besides the writing, which is impressively sharp, is the great chemistry between Raiff and Gelula, which allows both characters to feel fully formed. ",
            "This 'slice of life' film realistically portrays that the college experience isn't just one big party ... The concept isn't very original, but there's enough authenticity in how this story is depicted that it can strike an emotional chord with people.",
            "Shithouse gets the proud honor of being the first great romantic comedy of this decade.",
            "Despite its crappy title, Shithouse is alternatingly charming and frustrating. ",
            "One of the most authentic young adult narratives in years.",
            "There's something immensely and intimately relatable about S#!%house...a phenomenal feat by a filmmaker whose name we probably should get used to hearing. Honestly, the only thing about this movie that doesn't work wonderfully is its title.",
            "It's a sweet and simple narrative which makes excellent use of time and circumstance to convey, at least in a general sense, the mixture of freedom and malaise defining the college dormitory experience.",
            "You buy into the film because you buy into Alex, his failures and triumphs, and you can't help but cheer when he hits the whole romance thing out of the park. ",
            "Title notwithstanding, this is a gentle movie about a handsome college freshman who is too much a mama's boy to avoid awkwardness with a young woman.",
            "The movie's familiarity might make some uncomfortable, but Shithouse is worth taking a trip to on a night in. Let the sweet, awkward nostalgia wash over you.",
            "Raiff's coming-of-age drama doesn't explore new territory, but he establishes himself as a fresh voice by building empathy through gentle vulnerability and sincere humor.",
            "Raiff's introspective sensibilities and technical proficiency are impressive while maintaining a goofy spark that's infectious from start to finish. Shithouse is hands down the biggest cinematic surprise this year.",
            "[Cooper Raiff] put all of his efforts into telling this very human and relatable story about coping with moving forward in life and embracing new experiences.",
            "A genuinely engrossing, tender and wise slice-of-life channeling the films of Eric Rohmer and Richard Linklater with a sprinkle of John Hughes.",
            "Cooper Raiff is a talent to watch, and 'Shithouse' is his first great work.",
            "Charming, maddening, and fresh this tale of male vulnerability takes an original look at the tired romcom trope and feels authentic and imperfect, like life and love.",
            "A portrait of raw, evolved sensitivity, tackling an emotional late bloomer in a way that is never ironic or played for laughs (but that can still be pointedly funny)."

            "Though it initially shows signs of overcoming its creakiness, \"Capital\" loses value when its screenwriters try too hard to be clever.",
            "Human Capital plays like an icily precise neo-noir, but it's really an acidic black comedy as concerns the overriding selfish nature of humans.",
            "Human Capital stumbles on its blandly predictable, two dimensional characters and the implausible melodrama of its latter stages.",
            "Human Capital is a taut, cleverly tailored piece of filmmaking.",
            "The story isn't particularly sophisticated -- everything whips together more conveniently than a Sunday-night drama -- but the film itself is gripping.",
            "... in the end it is clear that, beyond the human capital of those involved (which ends up being translated into economic capital), the commitment to this humanity is lost. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Glossy and engrossing, Human Capital unfolds like a variation on one of those films that spend two hours showing how a handful of seemingly unrelated characters are connected.",
            " the film is so gripping, so mounting in its suspense that even as you struggle to keep together all its intertwining stories, you can't look away.",
            "Virz\u00ec's execution of Human Capital is like a fine tightrope balancing act in which slight changes in balance or center of gravity reveal different aspects of human nature.",

            "If you don't like the premise of 12 Hour Shift, you're not left with much to hold onto.",
            "It's hard to argue with Bettis's frazzled underplaying or Farnworth's stellar airhead routine, an impressively sustained study in quick-witted dimwittedness.",
            "The material is edgy and at times outrageously gory and chaotic, but Bettis gives Mandy an exhausted, fed-up quality that keeps the movie on track, even (or maybe especially) when she's pissed off about having to do everything herself.",
            "Grant's screenplay builds a Rube Goldbergian narrative of escalating, piled-up crises, from which she also engineers a just-credible-enough exit strategy.",
            "Overall, 12 Hour Shift is a wonderfully gross and grimy little crime film, made and led by brilliant women, that offers no judgement and a gruesomely good time at the (home) movies.",
            "Awash in bloody organs and scheming characters, writer-director Brea Grant's grisly dark comedy 12 Hour Shift ends up being more frenetic than inspired.",
            "Suffers a little from an oddly-paced plot that feels too low-energy for the type of organ-dealing madness that actually occurs in the film's plot. But when it does pick up the pace and dial up the stakes, it's offbeat, zany and a lot of fun.",
            "It takes a certain kind of psychopath to keep everyone else in check and 12 Hour Shift gleefully and unapologetically lets her run wild.",
            "\"12 Hour Shift\" is torture porn with only money shots and zero foreplay.",
            "The presence of Angela Bettis adds instant credibility to a horror movie...that is also the case with 12 Hour Shift, a horror thriller that has grace notes of gallows humor.",
            "It's a spiritedly entertaining bit of unrelenting nastiness, all of it centered on a strong performance from the versatile Bettis that's outstanding.",

            "Life in a small town can be mundane, and this caper spices up the overnight shift in a kooky way.",
            "A one-joke premise without much of a payoff, this labored horror-comedy make might your next hospital stay even more nerve-wracking.",

            "Keep the kids out of the room when you watch the film. It may be wickedly funny, but there's also a monumental amount of madness, which equals mayhem. ",
            "While it waivers with what kind of film it wants to be, 12 Hour Shift also struggles with how scenes flowed. The acting sometimes felt stifled and stunted, possibly due to problems with the script or how the actors fed off or interacted with each other. ",

            "Writer/director Brea Grant stacks macabre situations on top of each other to create a wild journey through a criminal enterprise.",

            "The Innocent is classy but droopy, definitely the sort of art movie to avoid after a long hard day. Despite a story destined to take hideously melodramatic turns, the movie remains sedate and formal.",
            "The Innocent is a beautifully made melodrama, whose elaborate and operatic moral dilemmas turn on issues that are curiosities today. ",
            "Visconti's last film strikes me as arguably the greatest of his late works apart from The Leopard -- a withering autocritique of masculine vanity and self-delusion.",
            "The film resolves itself into an almost painfully sincere meditation on masculine self-delusion. It has a great performance from Laura Antonelli as the wife, and excellent ones from Giannini and Jennifer O'Neill as husband and lover.",
            "While the parameters of The Innocent are far less epic than most of Visconti's most noted productions, his final venture is as lavish and opulent as all that had come before.",
            "Many have hailed it a masterpiece, but it's comparatively minor next to 1963's powerhouse The Leopard, another Visconti dissection of aristocratic angst.",
            "Opulent. Dated...a stiff. ",
            "Another of [Visconti's] elegantly composed portraits of the follies of the aristocracy, perhaps not among his very best films, but still a fine film from an absolute master. ",
            " The opulent period surroundings are both ravishing and asphyxiating, with these impeccably decorated drawing rooms coming to feel like mausoleums the characters have built around themselves. ",
            "The Innocent is fulsomely stamped with Visconti's style -- seldom has such lumbering been made to look so lovely. But the movie's blood runs cold: it's wordy and ponderous.",
            "Director Luchino Visconti, a giant of modern Italian cinema, died three years ago, just before this film was completed. Too bad: The final U.S. version clearly lacks the master's touch.",
            "The swan song film for veteran Italian filmmaker Luchino Visconti.",
            "\"L'Innocente\" is the kind of opulent, passionate drama that risks folly to attain the sublime.",
            "...despite all there is to gawk at in L'Innocente, nothing is quite so captivating as Giannini's galling cad.",
            "Visconti treats the script's florid speeches as sensual delights-translations into language of a vanished opulence that his images lovingly display.",
            "Visconti's final film, released just two months after his death, is a worthwhile conclusion to his great career, a telling adaptation of Gabriele d'Annunzio's 1892 novel about the decadence of the aristocracy in late 19th-century Italy.",
            "Coming after the dissolute wackiness of Ludwig and the cavorting valedictory of Conversation Piece, Luchino Visconti's swan song L'Innocente is something of a genteel and stately affair."

            "Lore, from Australian director Cate Shortland, proceeds like a long-ago fairy tale, dark-hued, grounded in real-life 20th-century horrors.",
            "Lore is a akin to a bourgeois German version of Elem Klimov's 1985 Belarus-set Come and See, and it has some outstanding features. The star turn is the lurking cinematography of Adam Arkapaw.",
            "The Australian director Cate Shortland has made a quite stunning film about the collapse of Nazi Germany, seen not from a Berlin bunker but through the eyes of a 14-year-old girl.",
            "The bleak backdrop is rendered with great beauty-so much so that perhaps the sensory poetics of the visuals linger beyond their darker implications.",
            "The young principals here, Malina and especially Rosendahl, are superb at conveying that premature hardening, their elastic minds pummelled by inelastic forces.",
            "The sins of the Fatherland send a German teenage girl and her Nazi-connected family on the run in Australian director Cate Shortland's vividly rendered and sensual drama Lore.",
            "A film you simply don't want to miss.",
            "Cate Shortland's tough, moving film is shot with great intimacy, driving home the idea that great horrors are ultimately a personal responsibility.",
            "Shortland has created a moving, intriguing and complex film, which provides one of the most intelligent and honest approaches to both Nazism and the holocaust seen on screen in recent years.",
            " A raw, urgent yet contemplative tone infuses every moment and, courtesy of cinematographer Adam Arkapaw, Shortland uses the country's foggy, murky landscape to stunning effect.",
            "The portrait that emerges proves, above all else, one of resilience and adaptability.",
            "Lore's textures and colors evoke equal parts wonder and horror.",
            "Remarkable. Raw, disorienting and it never bothers to tell you what it can instead show.",
            "Cate Shortland infuses a fresh perspective and a haunting moral quandary to the WWII genre, bringing a little seen part of human history to chilling life.",
            "Rosendahl puts the onslaught of horror and absurdity in poignant perspective with her limpid depiction of her character's growing resourcefulness and awareness.",
            "The deep-feeling Rosendahl makes a major impression as an intelligent girl learning the power of her sexuality and resolve under maximum stress.",
            "Shortland may not leave us with certainty, but in the context of so bloody a conflict fueled by intransigence and misguided idealism, the hope and the beauty of Lore is only strengthened by its embrace of youthful uncertainty.",
            "The dream of every director tasked with bringing such a difficult story to life is to have a star who can carry the drama, and in her feature debut, Rosendahl is a revelation.",
            "It's this mature take on the subject matter that makes Lore the finest Australian film of the year.",
            "We see no fighting and no high-level participants -- just ordinary people before a backdrop of natural beauty and manmade horror.",
            "With an eye for images that are both lush and foreboding, Cate Shortland dives confidently into a moral minefield and doesn't care about defusing the situation. ",
            "One could have made a much more didactic film with the same story - German girl learns Jews aren't so bad after all! - but Shortland is after something much more elliptical here. ",
            "Brings a distinctive perspective to familiar themes...",
            "Saskia Rosendahl succeeds in a demanding role set amidst a bleak post-war landscape. "

            "The French animated adventure Leap! is at turns stupendous and insufferable, the film never showing enough faith in its audience in order for the lovely little scenario of resilience and fortitude at the heart of things to ever resonate . . .",
            "Though the mix of poppy power anthems and Tchaikovsky isn't seamless and the familiar plot points are less than transporting, there's a beating heart to this tween story to match its exuberant dance sequences.",

            "Suspension between can-do spirit and come-down reality pumps blood into the irrepressible heart of this scrappy tale, along with the natural charisma of model Slick Woods, making a disarming feature debut in the title role.",
            "Goldie explodes with energy and hope.",
            "De Jong's portrait of an irrepressible New York teenager is as spirited as the central character and should find a welcome in global festivals and territories with an audience for gritty, big-hearted American independent cinema."

            "This is unbearably good cinema.",
            "There's no denying the boldness of [I Was at Home, But...]-fractured, elliptical, and highly mannered, the film hardly betrays Schanelec's ideology.",
            "Every element -- camera placement, music, blocking, sound design -- is so deliberate that it pulls you into its vortex, and it makes you submit to its severe rhythms.",
            "Schanelec creates a subdued, cryptic domestic drama-one denuded of the histrionics typically associated with the genre but one that nevertheless gives a real sense, if only in glimpses, of the burdens and joys of this Sch\u00f6neberg household.",
            "Despite its austere, theory-heavy minimalism, I Was At Home, But... is lopsided and lumpy, filled with longueurs in which the brain begins to check out.",
            "In most mainstream cinema, the story tugs you along - or prods you into its mazelike corridors and toward dead ends - encouraging you to wonder what happens next. Schanelec offers next to no such prompts, trusting that you'll keep watching anyway.",
            "A splendid Maren Eggert. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Schanelec shines by inserting expressive details, minimal in appearance in its planes. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "[Reaches] a multiplicity of possible interpretations. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "...a puzzle piece that is never solvable. We have opaque characters with Bresson-style delivery. We instead concentrate on gestures...we play around in our heads long after we leave the theater to make sense of it...",
            "A tender, profoundly moving portrait of grief and family, art and motherhood, the film is a formalist achievement that feels like a movement of true growth for Schanelec",
            "I Was at Home, But tests its audience and never tells them if they're right, and therein lies the challenge. The point is not to \"get\" the film but to have thought about it and come up with a whole array of personal truths. ",
            "Too much of this stilted installation piece is like a Jeff Wall photograph come to life, delivering details that mostly prove to be less interesting than what your imagination would have supplied.",
            "It's fair to wonder what this film has in store. The answer in writer/director Angela Schanetec's tenth feature is an imaginative, disjointed story of love and loss.",
            "A classroom production of \"Hamlet\" and an outburst of domestic rage are equally blank, arbitrary, and undeveloped.",
            "It may not offer much in the way of entertainment, but this is ultimately a film that deserves to be watched, re-watched, and pondered - slowly.",
            "The film of the German filmmaker has the dispersion populating the story with small great moments that might seem unexpected, but somehow are not flighty. [Full review in Spanish] ",
            "Despite the sluggish pace and severely cryptic approach, I greatly appreciated Schanelec's calm and patient hand at guiding I Was at Home, But to a place of mood and mystifying depth.",
            "[Director] Angela Schanelec, in one of her most opaque and impenetrable films, strikes her audience mercilessly. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "A film whose aesthetics may be intensely controlled and yet whose narrative is sprawling with meanings and readings.",
            "Angela Schanalec's film configures itself most potently in hindsight as a punch to the gut. ",
            "I mostly appreciated I Was at Home, But... for its many formal pleasures.",
            "In striving for the ineffable, I Was at Home, But... takes a step further along the trajectory towards a spiritual cinema that began with The Dreamed Path. ",
            "In another director's hands this might all have been a bit of a slog, but there is a quiet humor and lightness of touch to Schanelec's direction and a self-effacing irony to Aistrid's rambling the saves it from pure maudlinism. "

            "It's an endlessly funny and often uncomfortable piece of work, featuring some of the sharpest, deftest writing Brooks and frequent collaborator Monica Johnson ever crafted. ",
            "An amusingly bumpy ride.",
            "Lost in America is being called a yuppie comedy, but it's really about the much more universal subjects of greed, hedonism and panic. What makes it so funny is how much we can identify with it. ",
            "Brooks' Lost in America is a well-directed and effortlessly entertaining satire of the Reagan era.",
            "Even when sizable blunders burst into unimaginable proportions, it's difficult to be mad at these personas; they're funny when they bicker and charming when they reconnect.",
            "With co-writer Monica Johnson, his collaborator on Real Life and Modern Romance, Brooks has scripted the perfect outing for his gifts.",
            "Packed to the gills with Albert Brooks' signature dialog, and played to the hilt by both leads, Lost in America has a long set-up. But it's a testament to Brook's clever characterization.",
            "Brooks explodes the Kerouac fantasy by depicting two of the most uptight, urban people in the world trying to live it out. ",
            "Lost in America is one of the funniest films from one of our greatest cinematic comedians.",
            "Amusing satire on yuppies having a mid-life crisis.",
            "It is, I think, Brooks' masterpiece -- nothing inessential, one great scene after another, just flat-out perfect. Stanley Kubrick was an Albert Brooks fan for a reason.",
            "A complete joy from start to finish! See it before you take to the wide-open road!",
            "This sharply observed satire about disillusioned yuppies is Brooks' chef d'oeuvre and first commercial success, a film with an hero that's less obnoxious than the usual and a wonderful partner too, played by Julie Hagerty",

            "A film about mental health issues needs a good script and a first-rate cast to sustain a viewer's interest, and this one has neither.",
            "\"Inside the Rain\" switches erratically between comedy and drama while juggling many half-realized plot threads. But the movie's strange, inconsistent rhythm ultimately works as a reflection of Ben's manic and depressive states.",
            "In the end, Inside the Rain mostly succeeds thanks to its empathetic message for those who struggle with mental health and of course, Rosie Perez.",
            "Inside the Rain can't help but be a brave piece of filmmaking. But you might not expect it to be as funny as it is. And above all, you may well be caught off-guard by its frequent moments of visual beauty.",
            " I applaud Aaron Fisher's courage, tenacity, and resourcefulness not only to write, direct and star in the film but to put himself 'out there' in hopes of helping himself and others to understand his challenging condition.",

            "Inside The Rain was not what I expected it to be...a film that gives mental health issues the weight they deserve while also delivering comedy and romance in one-go.",

            "The film invokes a certain level of inspiration, further proving that no marginalized voice is less capable of excelling in the vast majority of genres in film.",
            "Director/screenwriter/actor Aaron Fisher has bipolar disorder himself so Inside the Rain is loosely based on his own experiences when he was in his twenties.",
            "This movie is an off-beat romantic comedy focusing on a bi-polar young man who can't get out of his own way. Although engaging, sometimes, Writer/Director Aaron Fisher's script can't get out of its own way. ",

            "There are two key additions to the narrative this time around, both fairly disastrous.",

            "Almost everything about this musical smacks of an inauthentic, forced recreation of the effortless 1980s charm that made the original Valley Girl movie a cult classic.",
            "Valley Girl is a totally rad musical throwback to the eighties complete with a wonderful soundtrack and an astounding performance from Jessica Rothe. ",
            "With the chemistry and shameless nostalgia-grab of jazzercise, leg warmers, and 80s pop, there's enough to Valley Girl to entertain, although there's admittedly little there to impress.",

            "Disney Channel style musical numbers give the story a propulsive energy but the artificial, generic tone also threatens to make the story weightless.",

            "It's puffery laden with dialogue written by people who think references are jokes.",
            "Valley Girl is a blast of enjoyable camp that is, unlike its teenage protagonists, entirely sure of its own identity. It knows it's broad, silly and cheesy, but it embraces that and turns its fantasy elements up to 11",
            "Is Valley Girl true to its tagline, 'the awesomest love story ever told'? No. It's predictable with a familiar narrative and familiar conflicts, but it's feel-good and highlights not the stereotypes of the era, but its boisterous energy.",

            "For a writer often accused of being humorless, this may be his most playful script, often arid in its dry humor, and much of it provided by Pattinson playing an inverted Felix Leiter to Washington's stoical Bond riff.",
            "Tenet is what happens when Nolan forgets Borden's wisdom [from The Prestige]. He's so obsessed with how impressive his 'secret' is that the trick he uses it for is nothing.",
            "What strikes you is how determinedly bare of feeling it seems, even when emotional opportunities present themselves.",
            "Telling a story backward sounds bizarre - it is bizarre - but it works. The backward stuff in \"Tenet\" sounds bizarre - worse than bizarre, goofy - and for a while it works. But once it doesn't, it really doesn't.",
            "A well-oiled machine in which each element fulfills a specific function, and like all machinery, lacks a soul... Nonetheless, Tenet is a fascinating experience. [Full review in Spanish]",

            "A beautiful mess.",

            "I was confused... but it was well executed, well acted. It looked fantastic. The set pieces, the originality of the story was great.",
            "A film that wends its way around time, backward and forward, needs some space, and filling it with more intricacy doesn't always work.",
            "For the first time in a long time Christopher Nolan's work just gets a bit tiring and tiresome as he exploits his obsession with time yet again in a way that's more noisy than expressive. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "An interesting palindrome, but really doesn't amount to anything significant. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Tenet is a heck of an achievement and is spectacular to watch. Technologically there is nothing like it.",
            "Tenet is the kind of movie that leaves you asking, \"Why can't we have John David Washington as James Bond?\"",
            "A cerebral thriller that gives us the most gimmicky version of Nolan we've seen yet. [Full review in spanish] ",
            "Grand scale cinema fuelled by big ideas is undercut by frustratingly poor storytelling and a dull lead performance by John David Washington.",
            "An often electrifying grand scale thriller that tackles bold structural concepts, but its execution is a decidedly mixed bag.",
            "When put in context of what we have come to expect from Christopher Nolan...Tenet seems to land with an even more despondent, painful thud.",
            "It's the Nolanest movie that ever Nolaned, for better and for worse, and even more so than any of his previous efforts.",
            "... asks viewers to trust what's going on will make sense once it reveals its secret... one of those rare instances where seeing the film more than once actually reaps a reward...",

            "Throughout, de Jong both romanticizes the unique vigor of New York City (especially the Bronx), and seeps the viewer into its harsh realities as everything grows more impossible for Goldie by the minute.",
            "\"Goldie\" is about how in the most dire of situations that click is ever more alluring, and ever more elusive.",
            "Woods, remarkably comfortable in her first film role, gives Goldie a steel spine and a feisty resourcefulness, her moments of vulnerability rare, but essential.",
            "Woods detonates an explosion of raging emotions.",
            " It's a chase movie with a twist: Instead of trying to escape from the police or criminals (which is the usual story in 'urban' movies), the protagonist is trying to keep her family together by trying to escape from Child Protective Services.",
            "I think I get it now, this ambivalence I feel about the film. I adore a 'black girl story' and a lead like Woods' Goldie is a joy to see. Yet this is a film about disappointment and sagging dreams; ",
            "With another director, this might be the stuff of shallow melodrama, but Sam de Jong keeps the retro flourishes coming, along with the vibrant humor.",
            "Scrappy and appealing -- if rarely outright dazzling -- but what truly sets the film apart is Slick Woods' performance. ",
            "Goldie is a bold expression of creativity both in front of and behind the scenes; supporting a film like this is paramount to showing the industry that art films matter.",
            "Goldie's energy is matched by Shawn Peter's kinetic cinematography, which is paired with animation by Smith & Lee, a colorful and undulating aesthetic reminiscent of Klasky-Csupo.",
            "Goldie shows its own brand of stylistic confidence, although it's also clear that the movie doesn't exactly know what it wants to do.",

            "Woods makes our heroine someone we warm to -- if not right away -- and more importantly, someone we won't forget.",
            "A lively, kinetic film that dances between the natural and the fanciful, centered on a dynamo of a cinematic character played by the first-time actress.",
            "De Jong forces us to face how few real opportunities are given to girls like Goldie, and to understand why someone would be willing to risk it all even to snatch a mere wisp of a dream. ",
            "This film is filled with bursts of color. The high energy visuals counterbalance the tragic malaise of Goldie's life perfectly.",
            "Suspension between can-do spirit and come-down reality pumps blood into the irrepressible heart of this scrappy tale, along with the natural charisma of model Slick Woods, making a disarming feature debut in the title role.",
            "Goldie explodes with energy and hope.",
            "De Jong's portrait of an irrepressible New York teenager is as spirited as the central character and should find a welcome in global festivals and territories with an audience for gritty, big-hearted American independent cinema."

            "The Erwin brothers are simply better filmmakers who package the same tropes in more polished vessels that mostly resemble mainstream offerings.",

            "Go to any museum. All the early stuff-it's all gods and saints. Art is meant to uplift. Faith-based films, albeit heavy-handedly, attempt to heal. So why trash them? They always have their hearts in the right place.",
            "I Still Believe, isn't even well-made propaganda, unlikely to win any converts or even inspire filmgoers to either visit the website or buy the album plugged at the end. ",
            "Although it aims to illustrate savory vibes of an uplifting higher power melodrama, from its pulpit the Erwin brothers simply muster up a sluggish Christian romancer that does not have a prayer.",
            "Despite the attractiveness of Apa and Robertson, and their committed performances, they are too often reduced to dialogue preachy enough to be spoofed by Ned Flanders. ",
            "I am surprised by how good I think it is... It finds a new way into the genre that I think is more mainstream than what people are expecting.",
            "A wonderful true story of love and Faith with a great cast",
            "A true story that's crafted as a compilation of well-worn cinematic clich\u00e9s and melodramatic beats, but it's offered in a slick manner that never interferes with what's being presented. ",
            "The film is a showcase for the talents of KJ Apa. The movie itself is a good, faith based film that doesn't deliver all it promises due to a weak performance by Britt Robertson. She just doesn't click in this performance like she has in the past.",
            "The film knows its target audience and plays into that throughout. This may then seem heavy handed for those less inclined to believe every word.",
            "With \"I Still Believe,\" the Erwin brothers raise the bar well above most faith-based films, in more ways than one.",
            "I Still Believe is a sweet film with an uplifting message that hope exists and love abounds. And with what's going on in the world, what's wrong with that?"

            "The Invisible Man is a reinterpretation of a classic character done right. By combining scares and thrills with a remarkable story that is timely and relatable, Whannell and Moss have brought the goods. Highly recommended.",
            "The horror her comes not from the jump scare, but from the psychological deterioration of Moss's character. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "The Invisible Man has a grand vision that it doesn't live up to.",
            "Elisabeth Moss brings full life to her characters. What an amazing and capable actress. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Whannell combines his proven skill at making the most of a low budget chiller with a sharp, timely message.",
            "Remarkably intense, consistently clever, and full of characters worth caring about, this is one of the best \"studio\" horror films in recent years.",
            "Hodge, Reid and Dyer are competent adjuncts. The movie makes use of conventional horror tropes, while Wallfisch's pounding score borders on the hysterical...but Invisible Man doesn't have anything even vaguely radical or oppositional about it. ",
            "The Invisible Man is a masterpiece of suspense. Less is definitely more when invisibility is the premise of the film. ",
            "Moss communicates with her bulging blue eyes the terror of past trauma, the panic of being systematically tyrannised, the helplessness of not being believed, and the courage to take her tyranniser down head on.",
            "Fear of the unknown is what drives us to be afraid, not fear of the thing itself. The Invisible Man, regrettably, fails to realise this",
            "Whannell puts a brilliant spin on this character that I've honestly felt has never been used to his full potential... It could quite possibly be the single best Universal Monster revival film we've ever had.",
            "You have to see it to believe it, but it's a rare remake that actually works, chilling in all the right ways and infusing enough modern sensibility for our current social climate.",
            "At last, we have up-to-date evidence that it's perfectly possible to make a new version of a classic story that neither tinkers unnecessarily, nor departs entirely from the tone and content which made the story so good in the first place.",
            "Who knew that a \"remake\" could be so refreshing? Leigh Whannel's 3rd turn in the director's chair feels refreshing, borrowing elements of the Universal Monster as a threat anchor. The Invisible Man, at its core, is a woman's cry for escape."

            "RZA tells this story (from a screenplay by Paul Cuschieri) with deliberation and imaginative daring. With \"Cut Throat City,\" his third feature, he comes into his own as a director.",
            "An entertaining, if familiar ride.",
            "\"Cut Throat City\" ends on a note that's too clever by half, but that doesn't undercut all the vibrant, rough-edged, impressive storytelling that led to that moment.",
            "While shaggy in its wide-eyed ambition, this heist-drama packs a potent thematic punch alongside its pulpy elements.",
            "Although the plot has too many elements spinning off in all sorts of directions to be truly coherent, and the backdrop deserves a bigger role than it's given, the big-time cast is worth the audience's focus. ",
            "... this tale of four friends trying to survive in a broken system has enough meat from the thematic elements to make the slightly complex narrative worth sticking it out for.",
            "For once dialogue is written to reflect the way Back people really talk masked in an male urban version of Set It Off in the big Easy. Ethan Hawke slays along with Wesley Snipes, T.I. and Terrance Howard.",
            "The good bits are worth pondering after the film has ended, and the bad bits will make the viewer wonder where everything went so far off the rails.",
            "Cut Throat City, despite its talented cast and an effort to be a somewhat stylish-looking film, still serves up [a] recycled and uninspired concept in a movie that doesn't really do anything for the genre of gangster films. ",
            "What lifts Cut Throat City far above the expected, is the political fury that propels it.",
            "Maybe RZA could have done more with a bigger budget, as this local story feels too unmoored from its surroundings, failing to capture the essence or vibe of New Orleans.",
            "I do think that Shameik Moore does a lot to ground the emotions of this film... It's fun moment-to-moment and it has a strong sense of character, but the overall piece is a little bit messy.",
            "\"Cut Throat City\" is a very dark, gritty and violent gangster thriller.",
            "Sometimes the machinery of the plot gets a little hard to believe, but our investment in the characters is always there to keep us going despite the somewhat excessive run time.",
            "Director RZA's epic crime drama is ungainly, overly long, and overly familiar, but its particular time and setting give it an ambitious scope and a righteous passion that energize it. ",
            "A film which feels overbaked and in desperate need of editing.",
            "RZA and writer P.G. Cuschieri do something that is sorely lacking in most genre movies.",
            "... a gritty and evocative heist thriller that doubles as a relevant examination of racial identity and socioeconomic despair.",
            "Cut Throat City checks off all the boxes you would expect in a heist film, but does it in a way that feels fresh and exciting.",
            "It's not a total loss, by any means, but is a mild disappointment.",

            "Bening and Nighy commit as best they can.",
            "That's undoubtedly an interesting idea but Grace (Bening) and Edward (Nighy) are so odd and awkward together, you can't believe their marriage would have lasted a week, let alone the 29 years it apparently has.",
            "Hope Gap is the occasion for a volcanically bitter performance from Bening. But it is otherwise prey to all the errors of pseudo-taste to which stage adaptations are prone...",
            "What's somehow radical here, however, is the way the film mostly follows Grace's point of view, and she is a difficult creature, hard to empathise with. But she is both magnificent and awful in a scene in a solicitor's office.",
            "Nicholson has form with writing later-life relationships, so it's a shame that the real hope gap here is that between expectation and reality.",
            "The film's biggest failing is that, unfortunately, Bening is terribly miscast here.Her wandering accent - is it Cockney? is it Home Counties? - becomes more jarring the longer we go on.",
            "With an acting trio like that you're guaranteed an involving watch but somehow this intense relationship drama fails to cut to the bone. Nicholson adapted this from his own play The Retreat From Moscow, and you can feel it.",
            "Although classy and occasionally insightful, Hope Gap tends to talk around difficult emotions rather than share them with the audience.",
            "Your sympathies are deftly toyed with; Nighy jitters and surprises; O'Connor has the sad gravity of the eternal referee.",
            "Although set in picturesque Seaford surroundings, it feels tremendously grim - other people's misery doesn't have to be this punishing.",
            "A cataclysmic casting decision combined with consistently flabby direction have conspired to transform this low-level divorce drama into a titter-inducing dud.",
            "A bookend to last year's A Marriage Story...a portrait of a marriage exploding like a white-hot supernova -- while Hope Gap depicts one that has dwindled to a dwarf star, collapsing under its own weight."
