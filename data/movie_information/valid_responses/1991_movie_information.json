            "This time Mr. Heavy Metal is on the side of the good guys. Naturally, he isn't quite as much fun.",
            "Twenty-six years later, T2 has lost none of its thrilling power, feminist ferocity, and ominous foreboding-and seen on a big screen, it still puts most of its modern Hollywood progeny to shame.",
            "Even though this movie was made nearly 30 years ago, almost nothing about it feels dated. ",
            "Twenty-six years after its release on Independence Day weekend in 1991, it's difficult not to watch Terminator 2: Judgement Day through a scrim of irony. ",
            "Linda Hamilton gets so little due respect over the years for how much of the film's midsection rides on her.",
            "\"The Terminator 2\" is movie-making on a massive scale, packed dense with spectacular touches that are too many to describe - escape scenes, helicopter stunts and huge explosions.",
            "While bigger isn't always better, writer/director James Cameron's follow-up is genuinely bigger and better in nearly every way.",
            "James Cameron's update of his sci-fi action classic is a great night at the movies. Just don't expect it to change your mind about 3D.",
            "Inarguably one of the greatest sequels ever made, Terminator 2 builds itself upon a few key ideas that upend the audience's expectations and work like gangbusters with industry-altering technological execution.",
            "No matter how bad the sequels get they can't undo the greatness of Terminator 2. This is a movie that will live forever.",
            "Cameron's vision makes the engine go and shows why he is one of the best blockbuster directors ever. ",
            "Terminator 2 is genuinely reverential towards Arnold, gazing raptly upon his physical form and elevating his lack of affect to something like a Platonic ideal of masculinity. ",
            "T2 truly attains the test of time with a fabulous story connected with smart and effective special effects that complement the story. ",
            "With Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Cameron has bested his own earlier effort with a sequel that takes the original themes, the darkly high-tech style and the cutting wit of his 1984 sci-fi hit The Terminator and pumps the energy up to kinetic overload.",
            "The main point to take away from this: Terminator 2: Judgment Day is (a) still great and (b) retroactively depressing because these characters all seem to be in a better situation than we are right now. ",
            "Terminator 2 is not only a bigger work than the original, it also cares more about the characters and their development, something that in the 1984 version was solved in a somewhat schematic way. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "embodies all that is great about summer movie thrills while also weaving through the various chase scenes, shoot-outs, and massive billowing explosions a genuine sense of human feeling and moral concern",
            "An explosive sequel.",
            "It proves that crackingly fast entertainment doesn't have to be mindless, and it manages to do so, with an endearingly cheeky sense of humour.",
            "Best of all, though, the level of tension in the film is palpable because we can`t figure out how Arnold is going to terminate the Terminator.",
            "Cameron`s superb action direction and stunning visual effects -- plus Schwarzenegger`s ultimately endearing (yes, endearing) performance -- will blast every other summer film to kingdom come.",
            "A pop epiphany, marking that commercially creative point where the power of Hollywood meets the purity of myth.",
            "The best efforts of highly trained talents are not enough to save the picture from its own deep-rooted foolishness.",
            "Cameron has done an honourable and undoubtedly skilful job of tailoring his new film to the tastes of the times without too much sloppy compromise. He's made a science fiction film with verve, imagination and even a little wit."

            "A simultaneously heartbreaking and exhilarating road movie.",

            "Although River Phoenix has distinguished himself as an actor ever since his second film, Stand By Me, nothing he has ever done before prepares you for his performance in Private Idaho as the motherless, homeless, loveless piece of human driftwood.",
            "This is a very rich, very sympathetic piece of work.",
            "[Van Sant] disdain[s] narrative. He got away with Drugstore Cowboy because its band of drugged-out dodoes were engaged in a petty crime spree that almost passed for a plot. But My Own Private Idaho is a different story. Or rather nonstory.",
            "One of the most original cinematic talents at work in this country, Van Sant has a knack for pulling disparate elements together and twisting them into wildly funny lyrical odysseys of the mind and heart.",
            "My Own Private Idaho may be an operatic arraignment of the class divide that continues to bring shame on America, Van Sant's film gleams brightest when Phoenix, with his wobbly, puppy-dog charisma appears on screen. ",
            "...a great enough idea that it almost doesn't bother me that these stories don't really illuminate one another. ",
            "It misrepresents illness in order to be amusing and Shakespeare in order to seem deep.",
            "\"My Own Private Idaho\" is both a love story and a tragedy. It remains the high point in Gus Van Sant's career.",
            "Cracked and beautiful, stranger than strange, yet in some assuring way so pulsing with life that it embraces you as warmly as Father Knows Best.",
            "Van Sant proves again that he is masterful at charting the hearts and minds of young people adrift.",
            "Audacious, controversial, directional, important and totally unique, you'll either love it or hate it. But see it!",
            "American indie god Gus Van Sant's most iconic moment was this giddily rich revisionist road movie-cum-western.",
            "The two actors create vivid characters, but they're so unsympathetic and Van Sant drags them through so many tiresome, pretentious scenes that it begins to look as if Phoenix's narcolepsy isn't part of the plot.",
            "Written and directed by Gus Van Sant, who mingles tremendous visual imagination with a leaning toward off-the-wall situations and sometimes raunchy images.",
            "Director-writer Gus Van Sant sets up disturbing -- and, often, oddly comic -- situations and then gives his characters (and actors) the freedom to explore them.",
            "Van Sant takes a lot of chances, and, visually, the movie is so imaginative, so fiercely alive, that it carries us along. But when the over-all design of the picture becomes clear, we feel cheated rather than enlightened.",
            "The movie weakens every time Mike's story is interrupted by the leaden allusions to Shakespeare.",
            "It's a very poetic film. That is, it includes images that may mean more to the director than the spectator, but the film is an interesting one.",
            "...gets off to a gangbusters start. And then Shakespeare butts in.",
            "My Own Private Idaho might be the perfect cinematic time capsule for '90s aimlessness, universal in its details.",
            "My Own Private Idaho is a seminal movie for many people. It certainly has been for me.",
            "My Own Private Idaho lacks the dramatic punchiness of Drugstore Cowboy, yet it's a rich, audacious experience."

            "Written during their own creative block, Joel and Ethan Coen's noirish satirical allegory decodes the myth of the \"sensitive\" artist, the mysteries of the creative process, and the ambiguities of Hollywood authorship."

            "It's one of those thrillers that you enjoy like a cheeky Big Mac. It tastes good, but once you consume and settle, it's not that filling.",
            "A simple premise executed with style, precision and efficiency. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Kiera Allen is astounding but the entire production feels imbalanced and rushed, favoring the horror in moments versus overall narrative cohesion.",
            "Part Lifetime movie, part over-familiar Stephen King riff, Run is a silly but effective little thriller, its predictable twists enlivened by the powerhouse performances of its stars.",
            "Disabled representation is long overdue, and Run sets the standard by doing it right."

            "It's a nice, pleasant celebration of friendship, but without much meat to chew on.",
            "Directed and co-written by first-timer Jon Avnet, the episodic production manages to capture the fried-tomato flavor of the deep South without becoming too pushy or patronizing about it.",
            "Fried Green Tomatoes is a case of a film acted with such skill and conviction that glaring problems of narrative, pace and structure seem like minor slips.",
            "The movie never quite shakes its stiff, studied feel, just as the town of Whistle Stop never stops seeming the quaint creation of an art director.",
            "For all of its false touches, its confusions, its incohesiveness and perplexing shifts of tone, there's something wonderfully sweet and zesty about Fried Green Tomatoes.",
            "It doesn't quite have the courage to face its own implications and so leaves the story that follows in a kind of blur apt to offend no one but equally incapable of moving anyone.",
            "Fried Green Tomatoes is gosh-darned lovable, even if it does get downright sugary at times.",
            "Essentially a story about friendship between two pairs of women, then and now, it could be classified as an intelligent woman's picture, but this truly uplifting and gratifying movie can and should be enjoyed by all.",
            "Fried Green Tomatoes is an engaging if sentimental tale, charmingly handled by producer-turned-director Jon Avnet and flawlessly acted by its four female stars.",
            "Fried Green Tomatoes is a cut above superficially similar 'women's pictures'. ",
            "The fine performances and worthy themes are sold short. There are two films here, neither one of which is as fully developed as it could be.",
            "The script plods. Tandy looks as though she'd rather be elsewhere. The desire is understandable.",
            "The characters are engaging, but the story is hackneyed and the filmmaking is dull.",
            "After all, it's not every day that one encounters a sensitive tale of sisterhood that also contains an element of cannibalism. For that alone, the movie deserves respect. ",
            "The movie left me wishing its sterling cast -- including a radiant Jessica Tandy -- had been better served.",
            "Stirring, sizzling serving of female empowerment.",
            "Tandy is at her sparkling best as the endearing old story-teller. Bates is also terrif in a funny and sympathetic turn. Director Jon Avnet, in his feature film debut, gets first-rate work from the featured performers.",
            "Please no.",
            "An immensely likable, wonderfully-performed film.",
            "The picture is about gender politics and a legacy of communal repression that is itself too embarrassed to port over a nearly-platonic-anyway love story between two women.",
            "More dizzying than the jumps between past and present is the speed with which consciousness-raised Evelyn swaps caricatures, evolving from Frump to Fighter.",
            "An enjoyable if sentimental chic flick that sanitizes Flagg's novel in two major respects, glossing over the lesbian relationship between Mary Louise Parker and Mary Stuart Masterson and underplaying the blatant racism in the trail of a black man."

            "[The film intercuts] ball scenes with interviews with the participants in less hectic, more reflective moments. It is those personal, humanizing moments, much more than the hectic, eye-catching hubbub of performance, that truly linger in the mind.",
            "If the wit, glamour and mind-boggling outfits of Paris Is Burning are disarming, not far beneath the film's surface is an immensely moving quality.",
            "If all you know about Voguing comes from Madonna, this spirited and heartbreaking documentary from first-time filmmaker Jennie Livingston will be an eyeopener.",
            "Paris is Burning is still an important film 30 years after its release - a snapshot of a specific time and place that humanizes its subjects and allows those of us in a place of privilege to understand them better. ",
            "A scintillating example of how art can serve life without compromising its objective of adding meaning to our journey.",
            "Not since Andy Warhol's The Chelsea Girls have I been so taken and fascinated by such a gallery of real-life, stunningly etched characters.",
            "Although the film has its dark moments, Paris Is Burning is mostly upbeat, and the overall message of the movie is heartening and humane.",
            "Livingston's film shows how fantasy can mitigate the sadness of life.",
            "Paris Is Burning is a daring and remarkable little film.",
            "The film is a comprehensive, if dated, tour through a subculture which, thanks to the ministrations of Madonna, has long since passed into the semi- mainstream.",
            "Livingston weaves these narratives together with pace and skill.",
            "The film is rude, colorful, and bursting with questions about American culture, subculture, and society.",
            "A fascinating, ironic, triumphant, tragic film.",
            "A rough-edged, talking- heads documentary, directed with skill if not polish by Jennie Livingston, that has found a topic almost unbelievably rich in cultural paradoxes and interpretive possibilities.",
            "Wildly entertaining, deeply humanitarian and fundamentally educational.",
            "Fun, yes, but also heartbreaking.",
            "Livingston provides an eye-opening, moving and revealing ode to desperate self re-invention, achieved through the tarnished glamour of an extended disco family.",
            "Both an exuberant portrait of gay culture and queer defiance during a time when visibility was low and discrimination was high.",
            "As en exercise in documentary filmmaking, it mines incredible honesty from its subjects and captures it with immense empathy and admiration.",
            " Jennie Livingston's documentary makes sure everyone has their day in the sun.",
            "The way that [director Jennie Livingstone] looks at the subculture and just lets them tell their own stories is just so wonderful. "

            "There are weaknesses here--especially when the climax becomes too packed and chaotic, and the goodby over-hasty. But Meyer and Flynn get a fullness back into the characters.",
            "Weighed down by a midsection even flabbier than the long-in-the-tooth cast, director Nicholas Meyer still delivers enough of what Trek auds hunger for to justify the trek to the local multiplex.",
            "Though patchy, this is a lot more fun than the disastrous Star Trek V.",
            "A rousing sendoff for Kirk, Spock, and Bones, and a fitting transition from the original series' Cold-War milieu to the Next-Generation age of engagement.",
            "It may not be overly exciting, but at least it doesn't poke fun at itself ... too much.",
            "An affecting farewell to the original Enterprise crew and a welcome return to form after the disappointing fifth film, The Undiscovered Country is as fun and creative as it is dramatically compelling.",

            "I hate to sound like a populist, but Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is the most enjoyable film I have seen this year.",
            "Star Trek VI goes nowhere. Through all its Confucian sayings, its United States-Soviet Union metaphor and its Shakespeare samplings, it tries to be sophisticated and witty but only achieves talkiness.",
            "Not very great Star Trek, but it's such an impeccably made popcorn movie that it's just not worth it to pretend that it matters.",

            "one of the best of the series",

            "SPOCK: 'Logic dictates we include all the ingredients which have proved popular in our earlier films. Data indicates that one crucial element is what humans call 'tongue-in-cheek' humor; in-jokes about previous episodes, self-mocking references, etc.'",
            "Meyer's direction and dialogue are among the most fluid and exciting of the whole series, and he manages a lovely 'final' feel, saying goodbye to the old crew and embracing the future at the same time.",
            "The bang/buck ratio is high and it's packed with pithy dialogue and little emotional kicks that make it a worthy, dignified sendoff for the crew we've followed for so many (dear God, so many) years."

            "It also lacks cuteness, which a movie of this sort needs. A film as predictable as this one is seriously in need of scenes that stand out, scenes that give the movie a little life, no pun intended.",
            "A decidedly dubious early 1990s love story from Joel Schumacher. The Kenny G sax solos don't help either.",
            "This is an upsetting, moving film -- not one for the weak of stomach, mind or heart.",

            "Dying Young belongs to the luminous Roberts. She is becoming one of the screen's finer actresses.",
            "Joel Schumacher has converted Richard Friedenberg's cliche-ridden, uninspired script into a generally tasteful though altogether unexciting cinematic experience.",
            "Worst of all, Dying Young is a love story about two people who don't seem to be in love with each other.",
            "Hilary O'Neil is poor but healthy, uneducated but full of spunky common sense. Victor Geddes is rich but mortally ill, overeducated and understandably fearful and withdrawn. In other words, they are made for each other.",
            "Dying Young isn't a shameless weeper, but that's not necessarily to its credit. In a genre like this, sometimes ''tasteful'' just means confused.",
            "It's not a strong or particularly endearing motion picture, caught in the stylish middle, with Schumacher Schumachering all over the film with extravagant lighting and blustery interiors.",

            "Much as I admire Costner, it is the very qualities of honesty, honor and sincerity he projects so forcefully that encumber this Robin.",
            "Its ostensibly canny match of star and subject assures that Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves will fill theaters. But will it send moviegoers out enthralled? The message from this cracked crystal ball is: Naaah.",
            "There's no subtlety in this Robin Hood, but subtlety isn't everything: Grit and obviousness have coarser charms, and the director makes much of these.",
            "The fight sequences are explosive, the physical production is impressive, and the supporting performances are full of juice.",
            "The biggest shock throughout the picture is the continually shifting tone - fueled by bizarre additives entirely foreign to standard interpretations.",
            "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves certainly boasts many of the qualities that one has come to expect from such an endeavor...",
            "Rickman's casualness is the unwitting emblem of this silly, but enjoyable, Hollywood romp from yesteryear. ",
            "It's a slick and sassy attempt to get mileage from a dependable vehicle by wrapping it in as many sure-fire gimmicks as the filmmakers can cram onto the screen.",
            "This is a big, colorful, sharp-witted and beautifully photographed rendering of the tale of the olde English guerrilla fighter -- two solidly entertaining hours.",
            "With a strange mix of varying English and American accents and the weight of a film with too many subplots, Robin Hood strains credibility. It also feels long.",
            "No longer a study in swashbuckling bravura, it is a depressive political allegory in which wit is as rare as a ray of sun in the gray British sky.",
            "It's fun and frantic, although the wit falls way short.",
            "Costner is not a Robin Hood for the ages, but in this expensively mounted production, he'll do as a Robin Hood for the summer.",
            "Buckles are truly swashed and derring-do effectively done in this 12th-century adventure, which simply sets out to entertain handsomely and does so with a great deal of dash, flash and panache.",
            "In the end, and only just barely, Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves delivers the goods, chiefly on the power of a thumpingly vibrant last 40 minutes and some excellent swordplay choreography.",
            "It was good in 1991. It's still good now.",
            "The familiar fable gets a modern makeover with mixed results.",
            "One of 1991's biggest hits, for reasons increasingly obscure. Costner and company struggle desperately to make the Robin Hood legend relevant to contemporary audiences.",
            "As a piece of escapism, this deluxe, action-heavy, 2-hour-and-21-minute Robin Hood gets the job done.",
            "More than happy to indulge a few moments of high-flying screen acrobatics, Prince delights in the muck -- a divine aesthetic that quickens the pace and, hopefully for younger viewers, encourages plenty of backyard recreation.",
            "The popularity of over-scored, \"let's hug\" bullshit like Robin Hood predicts the certainty of a one-term George H.W. presidency better than any number of Gallup polls.",
            "The bones of the story are comfortingly familiar, the action is rollicking, and the metaphorical moustache-twirling of Alan Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham is priceless. [Blu-ray]"

            "The Prince of Tides marks Ms. Streisand's triumphantly good job of locating that story's salient elements and making them come alive on the screen.",
            "Streisand hyperbolizes everything, from James Newton Howard's whackingly obtrusive score to Nick Nolte's overripe narration.",
            "The Prince of Tides remains important as the wellspring of a woman director/star who held her ground against the boys club of the Hollywood system and ultimately came out on top.",
            "Barbra Streisand critics like to harp on her narcissism, but there's no questioning her overwhelming generosity on this project. The movie completely belongs to Nick Nolte, who delivers a career-best performance.",
            "The main problem with Prince of Tides, however, is not the acting or the direction, but the source material... it reeks of bad novel.",
            "Directed with loving care by Barbra Streisand, this adaptation of the best-seller also boasts a serious flaw: Streisand herself.",
            "Self-indulgent, soap opera nonsense.",
            "As director, Streisand shows compassion for Pat Controy's Southern Gothic novel, and the film works better as a study of troubled childhood and male menopause than as romance between psychiatrist (poorly played by Streisand) and Nick Nolte as her patient",
            "Pretty good romantic soap...except for Streisand's talons.",
            "Nolte's terrific performance isn't enough to save this sappy, painfully phony piece of psychobabble.",
            "The musical score of the film is somewhat overbearing, but most other production values, such as editing, script-writing and direction are above average."

            "Medak's film is an angry story told with great force by very fine actors.",

            "the film is almost suffocatingly long, even though its ideas about actors, acting and real life are among Cassavetes's most intriguing.",

            "The dialogue is hilarious, loaded, questioning.",
            "It seems as box-fresh as a pair of white high-tops and as powerful and funny today as it was in 1991.",
            "Boyz N the Hood is a passionate drama shot with fluency and style, a study of what amounts to life during wartime, with people grimly used to gunfire and helicopters thudding overhead.",
            "It feels like it should be cheesy and manipulative, but the utter sincerity lifts it immeasurable.",
            "Though it eviscerates the white establishment from the opening reel, much of the film exhibits a deeply conservative worldview, even for 1991. ",
            "It's always risky to proclaim a new force in film based upon just one film, but Boyz N the Hood is good enough to suggest that John Singleton is going to be a major player for a long time.",
            "The story is laid out with the simplicity of a naive morality tale but is not in the least boring.",
            "All of these supporting characters proved indispensable to the film's lasting power.",
            "Singleton was only 23 when he made this urgent state-of-the-nation drama. But his skill with the camera, handling of actors, and raw dialogue suggests a seasoned pro.",
            "Powerful, old-school look at life surrounded by violence. ",
            "While it's often as pedantic and square as an Army training film, this movie about black teens trying to grow up in a gang-plagued South Central Los Angeles area generates strong emotions.",
            "This is a film that people should see.",
            "Like a jazz ensemble, Singleton and his actors slowly involve us in an almost sensual melange of moods, images and situations that take us inside the ghetto in a way mainstream films almost never do.",
            "What's fresh about Boyz N The Hood is the contemporary L.A. setting, presented with care and energy by young writer/director Singleton.",
            "John Singleton, a stunningly gifted newcomer, directed this complex and nuanced look at an urgently important subject.",
            "It's a terrific movie.",
            "Emotionally, this film will leave you grim-faced and shaken. It hits hard where so many films aim and miss -- at the heart.",
            "Alongside Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, this was the most astonishing and hard-hitting directorial debut of the 1990s.",
            "Singleton sometimes displays his youthful inexperience in melodramatic emphasis and rhetorical flourishes, but he has created a deeply troubling film about responsibility.",
            "This is an impressive debut for Singleton.",
            "An incredibly moving, character-rich drama about life in South Central L.A.",
            "A coming-of-age story without fluidity, hopping from scene to scene often indiscriminately. Singleton has stamina but lacks connective tissue, messing up development and motivation, unable to juggle the three distinct perspectives.",
            "An assured effort that hits home in relating to parental responsibility as a means of encouraging good citizenship.",
            "[VIDEO ESSAY] \"Boyz N the Hood\" is more than a time-capsule of American existence. It is a boldly defiant, and desperate, call for peace in the midst of anarchy. "

            "A Hollywood look into small town America that, somehow, rings real.",

            "From James Toback's crackling script to Warren Beatty's electric performance as gangster Ben Siegel, Bugsy is so engrossing that you feel uncharitable mentioning that while splendid in individual scenes, Barry Levinson's movie lacks propulsion.",
            "What finally distinguishes Bugsy from other mob movies is its ever-present sense of the absurd.",
            "Insouciant and flashy, co-producer Beatty is at his best when evoking the narcissistic, show-business side of Siegel.",
            "A great deal of the fun of watching this very assured film is seeing with what energetic panache the actor takes on the mantle of the mobster J. Edgar Hoover once called \"the most dangerous man in America.\"",
            "The picture belongs, in every sense of the word, to Beatty.",
            "Most actors give more contained performances as they get older or else they risk self-parody. Beatty, who has always seemed larger than life, gets even larger with age -- and on him it looks good.",
            "Annette Bening is phenomenal as sultry, foul-mouthed femme fatale/corporate lieutenant Virginia Hill. Worth watching for her alone.",
            "Beatty and Annette Bening charge their roles with energy, and the supporting cast includes such talents as Harvey Keitel, Joe Mantegna, Ben Kingsley, and Elliott Gould in sturdy performances.",
            "While Bugsy expertly captures the glamor of '40s Hollywood, it fails as the drama of a man whose dreams of glory lure him to an ignominious end.",
            "A clump of casinos in the sand is evidence of something, but I'm pretty sure it's not greatness.",
            "Oh, it's not that they cover up Siegel's brutal side, it's just that they undercut it by making the man just a victim of his own appetites, which is sort of like saying Charles Manson was just a little too enthusiastic about a certain Beatles tune.",
            "While avoiding the usual gangster film clich\u00e9s, director Barry Levinson also insists that Warren Beatty does more than coast through this movie on matin\u00e9e idol looks and easy charm.",
            "Warren Beatty delivers some of his best acting in years as Bugsy Siegel, the gangster responsible for the inception of Las Vegas as we now know it.",
            "Beatty's daring schizophrenic performance -- on the one hand charming and gregarious, on the other a brutal killing machine -- makes this one of the best performances (but not films) of his career.",
            "Levinson's direction is brisk and, for a film largely about the allure of glamour, suitably flashy.",
            "Barry Levinson's good-looking gangster pic may be nowhere near GoodFellas-calibre mob drama, but it manages to convey the menace and glamour of real-life west coast hood Benjamin 'Bugsy' Seigel (Warren Beatty) with evocative style.",
            "As Siegel, Warren Beatty hones the finest characterization of his career.",
            "Not just another gangster picture, as some had feared. James Toback`s sparkling script as interpreted by director Barry Levinson and producer-star Warren Beatty is both a rare love story between equals and a portrait of a dreamer.",
            "Barry Levinson's Bugsy will reignite your passion for inventive foul-mouthery, so inventively crafted and spitefully delivered are its swears.",
            "Exhausting in all the wrong ways.",
            "Stylish, clever, and fast on its feet, Bugsy is a movie of vast scope and many small pleasures, a lavish, beautifully designed epic that never quite decides what it wants to be.",
            "An absorbing narrative flow and a parade of colorful underworld characters vie for screen time with an unsatisfactory central romance.",
            "A first-rate production from top to bottom...Beatty has never been more electrifying on screen.",
            "Levinson n\u00e3o consegue retratar a viol\u00eancia da M\u00e1fia; Morricone exagera na auto-refer\u00eancia \u00e0 trilha de Os Intoc\u00e1veis; e o filme insiste em tratar Siegel, um psicopata, como um empreendedor sonhador. Ainda assim, a hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 interessante."

            "The film's use of once-imposing, now-crumbling New York architecture is particularly effective in underscoring the story with an air of widespread urban decay.",

            "A cynical director, Van Peebles has style to burn, but his work is too flashy to make sense. This is a gangster-thriller about crack trade in Harlem done as a moralistic melodrama with kinky violence.",
            "...a purely conventional story, but it unfolds in unique and innovative ways, with particularly good turns from its cast, all of which make it a worthwhile watch.",
            "It's basically Scarface with a hip-hop mentality, but it's also a slickly entertaining and consistently engaging crime thriller.",
            "Boasts some of the best performances of the early 90's...Ice T is a revelation",
            "It's still entertaining, but New Jack City now feels about as edgy as an old razor. And it's just as disposable.",

            "The whole thing is good-natured enough, but increasingly mechanical.",
            "Momentous, thrilling, intermittently comedic (but never unintentionally), smartly paced, and uncommonly entertaining.",

            "While The Rocketeer never crashes, it's a bumpy ride of cartoonish characters, a flimsy plot and an overall sense of letdown.",
            "It's not as dark or as edgy as Tim Burton's Batman films, but it's still cleaner and more digestible. It's not a deep story, but it's full of fun nostalgia and action.",
            "A beautifully directed, high-flyin' production, teeming with all sorts of classic Hollywood encounters and bizarre comic book touches...Connelly is mesmerizing -- a stupendous act of casting that elevates the room temperature of the picture.",

            "In that sense, Lee is a victim of his own high standard.",

            "You'll remember Sciorra and Snipes but wish you had learned more about them -- and the society that complicates their lives so cruelly.",
            "Lee's direction is wonderfully fluid and, as in most of his movies, he is superbly served by the striking cinematography of Ernest Dickerson and strong lead performances. However, there is a glibness to his script.",
            "Weaknesses aside, Jungle Fever remains the most thoughtful, provocative, and deeply felt statement on race problems and gender relations to arrive on screen in a very long time -- and the funniest and most entertaining to boot.",
            "Jungle Fever may be a failure, but it is the kind of failure that engenders hope: It finds Lee refining the skills he already possesses and striking out in encouraging new directions.",
            "A thematic follow up to Do the Right Thing, this is a powerful melodrama about the fatal and fateful effects of interracial romance.",
            "Snipes, it's clear, is a major actor.",
            "Lee brings a shotgun to a knife fight, but his visual energy is undeniably effective, spraying the screen with venom and appalling realities, with most of the feature locked in confessional mode.",

            "Includes a number of memorable set pieces, most notably a visit to a crack den which, accompanied by the epic sound of Stevie Wonder's \"Living In The City,\" is simply unforgettable.",
            "It's uneven, but its best moments -- such as Samuel L Jackson's performance -- are amongst Lee's finest achievements on film.",
            "Though Wesley Snipes and Annabella Sciorra perform well, the script provides no deeper motivations or meanings for their relationship. Situations around them prove more interesting and dynamic.",
            "Lee tackles the subject of interracial romance from the unavoidable vantage point that, while things today are more open, they are also considerably more volatile and complex.",
            "There are so many voices you may think you're swimming through a maelstrom, but thanks to Lee it's all superbly orchestrated.",
            "Lee is in fine form.",
            "Instead of showing how prejudice seeps into the private intimacies of daily life, the film turns its attention to the other characters."

            "Visually impressive, frequently pretentious, and extremely fluid as narrative (the 137 minutes sail by effortlessly), this mythic comedy-drama presents Gilliam as half seer, half snake-oil salesman and defies you to sort out which is which.",
            "Although there are moments when the mixture of comedy, fantasy and drama don't come off, this is still an original, touching movie that is well worth the price of a ticket.",
            "The Fisher King has two actors at the top of their form, and a compelling, well-directed and well-produced story.",
            "Working within the constraints of a big studio film has brought out Gilliam's best: he's become a true storyteller and a wonderful director of actors. This time he delights not only the eye but the soul.",
            "Stuffed to the point of emotional, narrative, and logical imbalance, there are as many moments of beauty as inelegance. But Gilliam's ambitious odd-couple outfit, based on a script from Richard LaGravenese, revels in its own unique flavoring.",
            "The relationship between Jack and Perry feels lived in ... Yet, the movie's relationship to the themes of mental illness, mass shooting and homelessness are clumsier.",
            "At times loud and brash, at others introvert and delicate, Gilliam has crafted something rather special in this rightfully-beloved film.",
            "Gilliam is not a director who does things by halves, and The Fisher King is as funny and emotive as the best of his work. Indeed, it's the heightened humanity of this film that resonates the strongest.",

            "The Fisher King's problems begin with Richard LaGravenese's screenplay and are amplified by Gilliam's showy direction and an unbearably fey performance by Robin Williams.",
            "As always, Williams turns romance into slush, but Gilliam reigns it in with his mad and magical design.",
            "A touching and funny one-of-a-kind gem about two lost souls who help each other find redemption. Bridges once again proves what an underappreciated actor he is, while Williams is at his manic best.",
            "As original as Gilliam is as a filmmaker, he too falls victims to Hollywood cliches as far as the portrait of the homeless is concerned (here Robin Williams)--they are either mad saints or misfit geniuses",

            "''Hook'' never sets sail.",
            "Spielberg's Neverland carries undeniable charm and depth. The problems start when we're asked to accept its two-dimensional residents as anything other than tourists on a forced march through its various nooks and crannies.",
            "Young kids will love this stuff. You're always aware of the effects, though, because Spielberg hasn't integrated the matte shots, storybook backgrounds, and other technical devices into the story; they're held up for the audience to ooh and aah over.",
            "Hook, featuring a grown-up version of the legendary Peter Pan facing off against the captain, offers a nostalgic trip full of adventure.",
            "While Hook successfully transitions between tones, and the Neverland sequences are gorgeous, the movie gets a bit bloated in its second act.",
            "What Williams brings to Peter though isn't just his effervescence, it's his pathos and vulnerability. He's a scared, confused man just hoping to save his kids and that core of love and humanity is what makes Hook work for those of us that love it.",
            "Hook has everything that Hollywood currently holds dear: precocious children, regressive adults and unabashed nostalgia for old-fashioned family values.",
            "\"Hook\" is a huge and impressive movie. One could say it's the ultimate baby-boomer fantasy. Sadly, it's too loaded down with grown-up compromises and calculated Hollywood devices to really makes us think happy thoughts ... and fly. ",
            "What it all is, really, is a glorious Spielbergian essay on the value, in gold doubloons, of rampant sentimentality.",
            "Unhappily, however, the transformation of a Type A American lawyer into a boy wonder unfolds with an uncertainty and clumsiness atypical of Spielberg.",
            "P.P., phone home. Or at least, get a new agent.",
            "Spielberg's Hook is an absolute delight.",
            "A painful and traitorous adventure. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "It lights up your eyes, but it doesn't quite warm your heart.",
            "Although the sentimentality gets a little sticky at times, this remains rousing entertainment.",
            "As top-heavy as Captain Hook's ornate, immobile ship, this lavish, elaborate production ultimately collapses under its own weight.",
            "Bob Hoskins hops aboard as Hook's hapless mate Smee while Julia Roberts sprinkles fairydust as the mischievous Tink.",
            "The story is hard to follow if you don't know Peter Pan already, and, for a child, probably even harder if you do.",
            "Given the inherent importance of children to the Peter Pan universe, it's near fatal that Hook has so many terrible child roles.",
            "In the end, Hook isn't great or terrible, but it's both - a film that has some wonderful moments, and some really awful ones",
            "You just have to appreciate its creative angle toward Peter Pan and his world."

            "Be grateful for the genuine amusement Dead Again supplies. It may be cotton candy, but it's well spun.",
            "His film is both a good mystery movie and a good movie-movie; its sheer \"movieness\" is what gives the picture its kick. As his career progressed, Branagh may very well have made better films than 'Dead Again.' But he never made another one this fun.",
            "Logic is dull and all that jazz. What isn't dull, though, is the way Branagh as a director attacks this material.",
            "Branagh's contemporary American accent is annoying, and the film's constant inter-cutting of past and present lives becomes laughable.",
            "As the twists come thick and fast and the plot gets progressively more and more baroque, Branagh shows himself to be at least as intelligent as Brian De Palma in delivering over-the-top stylistic filigree.",
            "The mixture of gritty noir and supernatural shenanigans sits uneasily, but the film may simply be too bizarre to work at all.",
            "It's a restless yet highly organized effort, displaying the director's desire to not just passively assemble a movie, but to rattle the senses as well.",
            "It straddles a fine line between genius and folly.",
            "Engaging in spite of its cheesy ending",
            "Dead Again is a truly enjoyable popcorn movie, even if it is ultimately total nonsense.",
            "Really pretty lame.",
            "Awesome mystery. The afterlife subplot works perfectly and sells the surprise twist.",
            "Director and star Kenneth Branagh brings the same zest and bravura style to this actors' romp of a mystery-thriller as he did to Henry V.",
            "Branagh's lame stab at a romantic psychological thriller makes no sense.",
            "A playful, whip-smart exercise in suspense.",
            "A big, convoluted, entertainingly dizzy romantic mystery melodrama. It's also another coup de cinema for Mr. Branagh."

            "For a while, the obviousness and flat-out vulgarity are sort of entertaining, and it might be possible to enjoy the movie as a camp classic if you could ignore the mean-spiritedness that keeps breaking through.",
            "Hysteria, however skillfully maintained, should never be mistaken for art -- a caution that applies equally to Stone and his subject.",
            "While it has its moments, taken by itself, The Doors amounts to little more than an impressionistic look at a boy and his death wish.",
            "Insidiously funny and remarkably truthful about the psychedelic rock scene in the late 1960.",
            "The whole movie is white hot, lapped in honeyed golds, evilly blue and black or drenched in those swoony, fiery reds. The Doors blasts your ears and scorches your eyes.",
            "Both a vibrant tribute to rock cult figure Jim Morrison and to the decade in which he flourished.",
            "The Doors is entertaining for the most part but the gem is Kilmer's performance of the rock legend who passed away before his time.",
            "Oliver Stone's The Doors is a grandiose, highly kinetic, film that flourishes in its own excess.",
            "Morrison is played with uncanny authenticity by Val Kilmer. The performance is utterly convincing without being terribly illuminating.",
            "The flaw in the film is its unrelenting tone of bombast. It never gives you a break. You ache for a moment of quietude, an escape from the lizard king's cranium.",
            "The much-anticipated film is a psychedelic circus that turns into the worst nightmare of a bad trip. It`s an experience.",
            "The movie is weighed down by its enchantment with the mythology, as opposed to the reality, of Morrison's life -- a mythology that needs to be explored, not simply reproduced on the wide screen.",
            "Val Kilmer does, however, pull off a remarkable impression of the troubled vocalist, although he's more convincing on stage than he is in his drunken, drug-fuelled reveries.",
            "Val Kilmer gives the performance of his career as Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone's biopic, so it's a shame the surrounding film lets him down.",
            "After the first hour or so of The Doors, the only door I wanted to see was the one marked ''EXIT.''",
            "Stone is not the most subtle of directors, but he has the ability to translate his passion for subject matter (he's an unabashed admirer of Morrison) to the screen with a strong visual flair. That talent in evidence here.",
            "Whatever reservations one may have about this exhausting, dark-side-of-the-'60s epic, there can be little doubt that Stone has captured a particular, bombs-away brand of rock & roll excess with definitive candor.",
            "Val Kilmer is extraordinary as Morrison, holding the centre with a demonic charisma, while Stone recreates the late '60s milieu with vibrant versimilitude.",
            "Intense biopic full of drugs, sex and rock'n'roll.",
            "The film really proves only that Jim was a bad drunk and a worse friend, and that in no way was his life exemplary.",
            "Not exactly Stone's finest hour, but a worthwhile portrait of 1960s (counter) culture and the self-destruction of an icon.",
            "Kilmer is convincing in the lead role, although he never allows the viewer to share any emotions.",
            "By recreating things too well, the film itself becomes as boring, indulgent and over-stuffed as its hero.",
            "The movie does a pretty good job with period ambience. But it's a long haul waiting for the hero to keel over."

            "The story sounds promising, yet there's a joyless, dutiful air to everything that happens. ",
            "Billy Bathgate isn't an awful film, it's just an empty, terribly conventional $40 million exercise. ",

            "All of the leads here -- especially Hoffman, big surprise there -- are top notch and thoroughly believable in their roles. Unfortunately, it seems no one thought out just what their roles should be."

            "Martin Scorsese's loose remake of J. Lee Thompson's 1962 thriller is an exercise in audience manipulation, with every frame designed to stagger the senses.",
            "It has a lot to recommend it, but did we really need a remake of Cape Fear?",

            "Jazzy and jauntily funny.",
            "As the movie becomes increasingly violent and unpleasant, the characters chase around after each other in a threadbare gangster plot about a trunk of gold.",
            "[A] flamboyant, engaging action comedy.",
            "Duke and company have been true to Himes' brash, blaspheming spirit, and that is no small thing.",
            "It bleeds for a kind of Harlem justice, as its intense black characters act tough, nasty, sexy, twisty, heroic and lively.",
            "A Rage in Harlem is the kind of film that, every ten minutes or so, requires violent bloodshed or a sexual rendezvous to prevent audiences from becoming glassy-eyed and slack-jawed.",
            "Based on Chester Himes's novel, this is a stylish, fast-moving and often humorous thriller from Deep Cover director Bill Duke.",
            "Underneath the fancy trappings, however, is a disappointingly ordinary caper movie that moves far too slowly for a picture of this type.",
            "That extraordinary cast, directed by Bill Duke, has little to do other than idle between sporadic outbursts of sadistic violence. ",
            "Bill Duke directed this mixture of high energy and low vulgarity, which doesn't do justice to the talents of its mostly black cast.",
            "It's largely a cheap looking, tawdry affair, with tortuous interludes in which the humour devolves on gratuitous unpleasantness or tired old bad jokes at the expense of women.",
            "Bill Duke's Harlem has the heft of an imaginatively heightened reality; it's a great place to visit.",
            "A delightful rendering of a Chester Himes novel with a 50s setting.",
            "A Rage in Harlem is an uneven combination of comedy and carnage. When it's good, it's very good. When it's not, it's simply bloody.",
            "There's just enough atmosphere, comedy, and raw acting talent in Bill Duke's amiable gangster-caper movie, A Rage In Harlem, to make you wish the plot weren't a complete shambles.",
            "Director Bill Duke has brought a stylish sheen to A Rage in Harlem, but his mix of comedy and violence in the Chester Himes period crime tale is dubious.",
            "It's hard to believe but this film offered the first to feature a black glamorous woman--Robin Givens--since Diana Ross's ill-fated Mahogany.",
            "For all the explicit violence, the film is less gritty noir than ebullient, good-natured fantasy.",
            "Strong adaptation of Chester Himes' pulp thriller",
            "It's painless, occasionally funny and has a heedlessly incomprehensible plot.",

            "...a thin premise that's employed to progressively lackluster effect by filmmaker Paul Mazursky...",
            "There are moments here and there, but it's mostly ordinary, unimaginative writing. Midler and Allen deserve better.",
