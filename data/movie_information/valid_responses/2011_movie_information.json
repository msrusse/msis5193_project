            "The final instalment, Deathly Hallows Part 2, is a bravura duel between good and evil. It's also a cathartic, occasionally clunky nostalgiafest.",
            "For 10 years and eight films we've gotten to watch these young actors grow as people, as performers and as characters. It has been a true coming-of-age saga, in the fullest and most moving sense of the term.",
            "The grand finish, if not always inspired, feels necessary. In a sustained, imaginative way, this is the best of any movie series.",
            "The film is strong enough to have the unusual effect of improving its predecessors in the memory simply by association.",
            "Fiennes and Rickman get the actorly moments they've been building toward for so long, and the film is most fun when it sticks to mechanics: roller coaster rides, battle scenes, close calls.",
            "One of the great things about this second Deathly Hallows is that it plays exceedingly well as either a stand-alone epic or a continuation of the previous chapter.",
            "The new locations are vast and mind-boggling, the sets beautifully decorated and detailed, and the creatures more impressively monstrous.",
            "There are so many moments, big and small, that leave you breathless.",
            "An epic showdown in gorgeous 3D, packing an emotional punch, this cast and crew should take their final bow with pride before their devoted fans. ",
            "[The film] ends the series so beautifully, and shows such reverence for the books that inspired and affected them so deeply.",
            "Good film directed for a teenage audience in which not only is magic taught but also how stereotypes affect it while the film itself recreates some British stereotypes. [Review in Spanish]",
            "Yates strikes a pitch-perfect balance between rousing action, pathos, tenderness and even humor.",
            "This final chapter of the beloved franchise is a satisfying end to the series, even if it falls short of the promise teased in its slightly superior predecessor.",
            "It's true it is very different from the book... Nevertheless, I like this movie. I think it ends the series in a very satisfying way.",
            "I was impressed with the incredible amount of edge-of-your-seat action, the brilliant ways in which they worked the 3D F/X in, and just the way the whole thing came together.",
            "To those who have loved this journey throughout, it seems a perfect last look at this magical world with a human heart.",
            "\"Words are the most powerful magic,\" Dumbledore says in this film. But words must be spoken by people, and the incredible cast assembled here make magic one last time for what will surely be an appreciative audience.",
            "David Yates finally gives us the Harry Potter film we have been waiting for; a beautifully shot, incredibly loyal final chapter that mixes heartfelt emotion, strong performances and miraculous action.",
            "Like the very best fairy tales, Harry Potter offers us a burning vision of our own world, with goodness and evil helpfully labeled.",
            "The effects and acting are top notch, with a vast cast providing well-developed background characters.",
            "The danger is seething as both sides battle between extravagant set pieces and eye-catching special effects.",
            "Deathly Hallows part 2 struck all the right notes of action, adventure, friendship, courage and love.",
            "We're left just as we should be, spellbound in darkness, with our Harry Potter 3-D glasses.",
            "Certainly Hollywood will circle back to this beloved fantasy series, but it's hard to imagine that any future film adaptations could be more lovingly crafted, or more beloved by fans."

            "The invention here is often still dazzling, the race sequences are invigorating and spirited voice work atones for the inexpressiveness of the cars themselves. Even so, this isn't Pixar at top gear. ",

            "Start your engines! You're in for the adventure of your life with Cars 2.",
            "Yes, the movie has some weak spots. A little long, a little light on story, and, gratefully, heavy on visuals...but I say, with Pixar, do we always need missing parents and tearjerking, with tissues always an arm's reach away?",
            "I defy anyone to tell me with a straight face that this is anywhere near as awful as 2011's other family hits, Zookeeper and Mr. Popper's Penguins. Case closed.",
            "The animation... alone is good enough for it worth a watch.",
            "There's a fine line between being healthily assertive in joining the conversation and being rude, however unintentionally. Mater is on the wrong side of that line, which gives Cars 2 a bit of a strange message.",
            "There's much to look at, but little to follow.",
            "Cars 2 suffers from a charmless and immoderately talky storyline that hikes up the thrills but forgets the widespread appeal of its far superior contemporaries. ",
            "The animation whizzes at Pixar shift from weightier fare to madcap action in \"Cars 2,\" a zippy, multitrack adventure custom built for gearheads, racing fans and little boys.",

            "The problems start and end with the uninspired, witless and convoluted script.",

            "Undoubtedly flawed, this animated film is still (barely) worth seeing.",

            "It ... arrives with the vast reserves of patience, optimism and artistry we've come to expect from this studio.",
            "The incest-scare subplot never trips up the movie's charm. And there's a haunting reverberance, very Hayao Miyazaki, to the war memories that empower the parental back-stories.",
            "Not up there with the Ghibli masterworks of yore, but still a bounty of ideas and emotions.",
            "You don't watch a Studio Ghibli film so much as sink into it like a hot spring, with groans of delight.",
            "Though From Up On Poppy Hill lacks the magic or pure emotion of some of Ghibli's finest work, Goro's sophomore feature still stands as a testament to why hand drawn animation should never perish in the face of digital wizardry.",
            "It's a sweet, simple movie about likable people growing up and figuring out who they are.",
            "Accompanied by a joyous, honky-tonk score from Satoshi Takebe and earnestly voiced by its leads, this is a perfectly rendered world that quietly throbs with sadness and thrums with modern progress.",
            "This 1960s-set melodrama carries such deep currents of emotion and so much affection for its sweet-natured characters, that by the end I was pretty sure it would rank among my two or three favorites from the studio.",
            "The atmosphere is so potent, so rich and distinct that it overshadows the meagerness of the story which is really little more than a kitschy soap opera.",
            "A rather mediocre film...And yet, even with all of its faults, I still find myself oddly swept up in its familial drama.",
            "If this Ghibli creation is smaller in scale than many of the company's films, it certainly doesn't lack for heart or soul. I was swept away in it.",
            "There are no real villains in this story. All the people are basically good and they try to do the right thing. The artwork is beautiful and the film also has considerable emotional power.",
            "The story will undoubtedly appear slow moving and uneventful to those used to the pizzazz of Pixar, but allow the richly detailed hand-drawn animation to work its charms and the film's mood of gentle nostalgia proves surprisingly moving. ",
            "A lovely Japanese hand-drawn animated film with a female heroine.",
            "It's really hard to go wrong with a Studio Ghibli film, and From Up on Poppy Hill is no exception. It may not be their very best work, but it's still good work, full of charm and fun.",
            "The magic is found in the everyday details of domestic life.",
            "It's a lively, touching story, full of sadness and optimism, drawn with an unaffected simplicity.",
            "An interesting way of tackling everything from understanding parentage to the atomic bomb which devastated Nagasaki.",
            "From Up On Poppy Hill finds Goro Miyazaki sitting much more comfortably in the director's chair, but fans of Studio Ghibli's fantasy epics may find this fanciful delight to be lacking the familiar magic.",
            "Joyously warm and gentle... though perhaps too gentle to be entirely satisfying.",
            "From Up on Poppy Hill's protagonists emerge as unexpectedly facetless, especially from a studio with such a vibrant and morally complex back catalogue.",
            "The gorgeous score and subtle visual craft save this entry in the Ghibli canon from mediocrity. But given what the studio is capable of, it's not everything fans will be hoping for."

            "Shark Night, handled with impersonality by Snakes on a Plane pilot David R. Ellis, aspires to nothing more or less than carrying along an audience through a string of unremarkable kills, often involving high-jumping fish.",
            "A second round is out of the question. Unless, of course, they called it \"Gladys Knight 3D.'' Then all is forgiven.",
            "The sharks are rubber and the performances are wooden and that's just about all you need to know.",
            "The result is a movie that isn't crummy, exactly, just blah: when the freakiest teeth on screen belong not to one of Walt Conti's animatronically realized sharks but to a good-ol'-boy called Red, you know you have a problem.",
            "Sharks have it bad enough as endangered, misunderstood predators with a terrible public relations image without seeing their serial-killing stardom drowned out by hammy acting and torture-porn villainy.",
            "It doesn't even live up to the minimal promises of the title: There isn't enough shark action, it mostly takes place during the day, and the 3-D only asserts itself in a couple of shots.",
            "So bad that you might just enjoy yourself.",
            "Too silly to be seen as any kind of serious critique of American culture and too caught up in its own thematic self-reflexivity to be a completely satisfying piece of junk horror.",
            "Ellis does a good job with timing and cuts together what looks like footage of real sharks with his actors in a way that makes us take notice without having too many shots where what we may assume is an animatronic shark is in frame with a performer.",
            "No matter how hastily pieced together the film feels, you can't help but admire Ellis' tenacity... It's just a shame it's not any good.",
            "When I wasn't laughing at the scenes of sharks leaping out of the water to attack their prey (in trees! on jetskis!) I was questioning the happy coincidence of a runaway motorboat heading directly towards a pier littered with flammable gas tanks.",
            "An atrocious waste of time, this \"Night\" is one you'll quickly forget.",
            "Predictable. Disposable. Listless. Boring. This is not how you make great horror films.",
            "The most disturbing sequence comes after the end credits, actually, when the actors are shown performing together on a really bad rap video. ",
            "This clearly isn't a film that wants to win awards for logic, so it dives head first in to just pure idiocy, and never comes back up for air.",
            "Never mind that the film is never scary; it also is never much *fun*.",
            "Awful on nearly every level, but wholly entertaining as a laugh-out-loud party movie. Shark Night is dumb, but you probably won't care.",
            "This film falls apart in the deliberately bad character development which never quite registers as a joke but rather as a weak attempt at actually developing the characters.",
            "The end result is a horror effort that never becomes the guilty pleasure it clearly wants to be...",
            "full review at Movies for the Masses",
            "This is a pretty bad movie that (I think) knows it's a pretty bad movie. What keeps it from being even worse and entering into the useless 'torture porn' genre is its PG-13 rating, which teeters on the brink of 'R' territory throughout. ",
            "A bad taste frenzy, with cameras tied to the bellies of some beasts contained by crooks in a salt water lake."

            "The production is still needlessly overlong and overblown, a far cry from your father's (or even your cousin's) conception of the master detective. But it's certainly lively and has clever moments that involve Holmes' keen powers of observation...",

            "This is a breezy, fun, and funny film that doesn't waste any time in getting its story told by propelling its characters into one crazy situation after another.",

            "Rio is a beautifully animated family frolic sure to keep the little ones joyfully content.",
            "Rio is a brightly-colored, dizzying pinwheel of 3D animation in which nothing much happens. Sounds like summer is here early.",
            "Carlos Saldanha's sincere but uninspired romp into the glossy postcard atmosphere of Rio de Janeiro is one long courtship that ultimately falls flat.",
            "The plotting here is of the set-up-the-pins-and-knock-them-down variety, so you'll pretty much predict every grinding of the script's gears. ",

            "While it may entertain the kiddies for a while, for the older folks out there (and that means anyone 10+), Rio is just another animated yawner.",
            "Comical, colorful, wonderfully cast and beautifully animated, \"Rio\" is the first Blue Sky movie that could be compared to the best of Pixar.",
            "This is simply a film that both kids and parents can enjoy together, which, according to the consensuses for other recent kids' films, hasn't happened for awhile, so my advice would be to take advantage of it",

            "The performances are effective all around with director Kendrick quite moving in the central role of Adam, the veteran officer, who suffers a horrific family tragedy that sets much of the film's plot in motion.",
            "Praise be to Courageous for being upfront.",
            "A valiant effort, but Courageous is such a clumsy motion picture, incapable of delivering its critical messages without displaying some of the most cringe-inducing filmmaking of the year.",
            "If you have a tendency to nod off during sermons, Courageous has a cure for that -- a noisy last act gun-battle with drug dealers that's primetime ready.",

            "Like a pastor so caught up in the moment that he can't see that the air conditioning has given out and the congregation wants to go home, the film travels far beyond its dramatic climax, aiming for an altar call finale."

            "You know, this is not about a woman struggling to have it all. It's about a woman who does have it all and wants more. It's kind of obscene. ",
            "This movie goes nowhere, says nothing and does it all with about as much stylistic flourish as a lazy yawn.",
            "There's nothing particular strong or telling about its comedy.",
            "The film uses its breezy comic tone to makes some raw points about the fidelity, motherhood and compromise.",
            " Oh, look, it's rich people in beautifully appointed houses and they're worried that the nanny might not arrive on time for them to make important morning meetings at work. Boo-hoo.",
            "This film takes the most wrenching and universal dilemma of family life and turns it into a sitcom-y love letter to Sarah Jessica Parker. ",
            "Kinnear has a naturalness about him that works wonders in this film.",
            " It may not leave any kind of lasting impression, but as a pleasant, throwaway night on the couch with a bucket of popcorn, you could certainly do a lot worse.",
            "Let's face it; Parker and the rest of the cast could do this with their eyes closed. It's the cinematic equivalent of a \"stop gap\" -- just something to fill in the time until a proper role comes along. ",
            "It's the film equivalent of having a gun put to your head by someone who is intent on getting you to understand that women are incomplete if they're not mothers.",
            "This very typical romantic comedy flubs details repeatedly in order to reach the moments that it wants to reach.",
            "About as funny as lice.",
            "The title could easily apply to star Sarah Jessica Parker, for how such a charmless actor has maintained such career longevity and popularity is a marvel.",
            "Tepid.",
            "A serviceable comedy about women who want to 'have it all,' 'I Don't Know How She Does It' takes a look at a working mother who faces the challenge of balancing her career and her family.",
            "If you enjoyed Sex and the City, you'll like this funny, sassy and fast-paced melting pot of domestic and business chaos, where the key to juggling is throwing, not catching",
            "Too real to be escapist and too sitcom-ish to be realistic... not dramatic enough to be a drama, not comedic enough to be comedy....",
            "This sappy, crappy and condescending chick flick has been slapped together for those wishing to bask in the cinematic afterglow of the ever-radiant Sarah Jessica Parker.",
            "A good helping of amusingly sharp lines cannot save this uncomfortably odd beast.",
            "There is enough depth of drama to warrant a (short) TV series, but not a film.",
            "What saves things from becoming entirely dreary is its cast ... ",
            "It ought to be easy to snark at this film, but the truth is it just left me feeling depressed. It's not how they do it that mystifies me, but why.",

            "Without the sweeping aerial shots and the rest of the highly impressive camerawork, the documentary doesn't add up to more than standard, harmless wilderness fare for the kiddos.",

            "It is beautifully shot - the super slo-mo scenes of Sita running are amazing.",
            "Providing a feast of kills, confrontations and capering cubs while keeping on-screen gore to a minimum, nature lovers of all ages will get their fill.",
            "Narrated by Patrick Stewart, this is beautifully shot if a tad toothless. Nothing to upset tots.",
            "The wildlife is beautifully photographed, and the film is stentorianally narrated by Sir Patrick Stewart.",
            "A wealth of visually stunning, strikingly intimate, and intensely dramatic footage of these creatures in their beautiful natural habitat.",
            "The first entry in the DisneyNature series that's pitched at youngsters rather than a general audience, despite some intense footage.",
            "In the animal kingdom's kill-or-be-killed world, the predators and prey are framed with a clarity and precision that would serve as an invaluable lesson to any aspiring cinematographer."

            "Somewhat shockingly, the modern interpretation of mankind's downfall is actually pretty darn good.",
            "A reasonably muscular popcorn film with a surprisingly tender soul.",
            "Rise of the Planet of the Apes is spectacle with a kick: the transcendence of the normal in creatures so like ourselves is both an entertainment and a needling rebuke to human vanity.",
            "The action scenes (particularly a battle between humans and apes on the Golden Gate Bridge) are inventively spectacular, and the story at the movie's core is evocative and engaging.",
            "It's unfortunate that the use of nothing but computer-generated monkeys still can't fool the human eye, never appearing entirely believable in movement or appearance.",
            "While the human performances convince, it is Peter Jackson's Oscar-winning Weta Digital that really advances the film. ",
            "Every now and again, a film comes out and totally surprises you. Rise of the Planet of the Apes is one of those films.",
            "A breath of fresh air, not only in the world of summer movies, but as a reboot in general.",
            "Could have easily rested on the CGI and action and been a satisfying film, but there is heart and soul here, too -- thanks to Caesar, a fully fleshed-out and complex character. ",
            "It is frustrating in places, but overall, it's entertaining and even somewhat moving.",
            "The film looks good -- Caesar is a real character, not simply a futuristic fantasy created to prove a point.",
            "Perhaps the most brilliant narrative move in a host of brilliant narrative moves executed by Rise of the Planet of the Apes is that it's an \"end of the world\" movie that manages to make us forget it's an \"end of the world\" movie.",
            "When the apes get smart, it's pretty thrilling...may this be the first of many Uprising Movies, and may they give us all some practical ideas for future use.",
            "A visual treat that should remind audiences just why they love to see summer blockbusters - because every now and then they are both enjoyable and well-made films.",
            "The kids have to go back to school soon enough, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes offers one last shot at some great summer fun.",
            "Rise of the Planet of the Apes is one of those rare films that, like its ape protagonist, comes from humble stock but manages to exceed expectations profoundly.",
            "Paced like a rocket but de-politicized and de-poeticized, adorned with sprawling camera movements yet trapped in shallow screen space, the film clomps through with a flatness that makes its vision of the beginning of mankind's end seem weirdly soothing.",
            "The story has big ideas but is underwritten, the acting is pedestrian at best, and though the CGI apes are very well actualized, they still look cartoony at times.",
            "Rupert Wyatt delivers on the giddy pleasures - climbing, leaping, swinging, plus the irresistable high of an upward-rushing learning curve.",
            "Rise of the Planet of the Apes is simian cinema at its best.",
            "Apes is one of the better political films I've seen lately, and its arrival in theatre is oddly timely, given current events.",
            "You can tell me all day that this is great, Avatar-like use of animation. I'll even grant the point. But though I was engaged in the first half of the film, this action section left me looking at my watch."

            "The characters' all-round unpleasantness, and the film's merciless mirth-making with their failings, keeps things buoyantly, bleakly funny.",
            "The real star of the film, perhaps, is Christoph Waltz.",
            "Polanski doesn't shy away from the inherent theatricality in the conceit of having four characters stuck in an apartment, and is wise to actually make a feature of it.",
            "The evening dissolves into irrational outbursts tinged with misogyny, homophobia and racism.",
            "The linchpin of the drama is fairly one-note: beneath civility lies cruelty. And there is perhaps a bit too much New Yorker-style, upper-middle self-satisfaction in that rather thin insight. ",
            "Overall Carnage is really funny comedy and worth seeing.",
            "A deep meditation on the human condition and the fine line that separates social convention from simple tribalism.",
            "It's like being realistically stuck in a room with four increasingly unpleasant people, listening to an argument that we can neither empathize with nor enter ourselves.",
            "Carnage\" visually never feels stagey, expertly capturing the diametrically opposed emotions of dueling characters within a scene often in a single frame. ",
            "As painful as it was for the two couples in this story to meet and spend, it seems, 80 minutes together, it was even more brutal for the audience.",
            "Smart, dark, uncomfortable yet somehow endlessly watchable.",
            "Carnage is,... worth seeing for Jodie Foster's first major performance in years. As a woman utterly convinced of her own superiority and righteousness, Foster gives us a very welcome reminder of her talent and her fearlessness.",
            "It plays like Edward Albee's classic \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" rewritten by the staff of \"Frasier\" into something a little less threatening.",
            "Roman Polanski, adapting a play by Yasmina Reza into a Brooklyn kammerspiel, turns Bu\u00f1uel's \"The Exterminating Angel\" into a non-fantastic comedic farce of banal bourgeois pettiness.",
            "I doubt whether anyone will recognize elements of themselves within these characters, and without that, one can't identify enough with any of the protagonists to bring about the kind of discomfort that comes with the self-recognition of human failing.",
            "\"Carnage\" is just another in a long line of improbable movie depictions of New York as seen in \"Sex and the City\" and other such drivel.",
            "The funniest movie I saw last year. A short, tart, altogether delectable slice of misanthropy.",
            "While the film, at a staggering and quick 80 minute runtime, plays exceedingly well off the energy of the performers, the downfall ultimately lies in a \"loss of steam\" vigor that is evident by picture's end.",
            "Few recent movies have been this perceptive about such immediate human conflicts, much less this funny."

            "\"Polisse\" draws us uncomfortably close to a taboo subject then rewards us with real nourishment.",
            "A drama with interesting moments, but also some false notes and a wildly bizarre ending.",
            "So amorphous, volatile and multi-plotted it could be a rough cut.",
            "It's restless and compelling, ragged and moving.",
            "Polisse is a finely wrought piece of compelling cinema, and certainly demonstrates that in the director's chair, Maiwenn is someone to watch out for.",
            "When Polisse sticks to its realistic fly-on-the-wall approach to the CPU it's some of the best filmmaking from this year, but its poor attempts to make the film more of a character piece hold it back from being truly great.",
            "Despite all the best intentions, Ma\u00efwenn's CPU melodrama feels like a TV mini-series hastily re-edited for the big screen, with little or no cinematic consideration. ",
            "That emphasis on realism, in plot and portrayal, has paid off.",
            "[Maiwenn] ets such good performances out of a huge cast that one can forgive the navel-gazing, and in a movie about a police force with management issues, she is clearly an effective manager.",
            "Supremely and superbly character-driven, this film is a throwback to many of the best police dramas of the past.",
            "The ensemble cast is natural, lively and truthful. The balance of personal stories and criminal cases is perfect.",
            "It has the makings for a pretty good cop show. But as a movie, this 'inside' look at the dozen or so dedicated members of the Parisian Child Protection Unit is conspicuously lacking in coherence and depth.",
            "It gets across its message on the plight of the innocent children.",
            "The French drama is a gritty and intimate look at big-city detectives that had me wondering what the French word for \"wire\" is. ",
            "...a tough and mostly rewarding ride, sort of like a full season of a novelistic cable drama like The Wire compressed into a two-hour serving ... ",
            "Polisse connects fitfully through its sheer urgency -- it's a work of deep feeling. But the movie, which opts for a baseline emotional setting of overheated, eventually starts to come across as pummeling, and one-note.",
            "A (chaotic) tour-de-force ...",
            "It's an affecting film that's has stuck with me since I left the theatre.",
            "\"Polisse\" made me wonder how to say, \"Its reach exceeds its grasp,\" in French.",
            "Though made as a feature film, Polisse looks suspiciously like a few episodes of medium-quality TV stapled together...a contender for one of the most overrated films of 2012.",
            "A cohesive energy and dramatic weight draws us ever tighter to its gut wrenching centre",
            "It plays out like a vibrant, explosive slice of life .... It's not always comfortable to watch, but one thing is assured: this is one film you will not forget"

            "Chandor manages to induce a certain amount of unease and dread in the initial proceedings. But what begins like a prophetic Wall Street set John Grisham novel quickly becomes a stalemate of soliloquies.",
            "Margin Call is worth seeing for its cast and for its intentions, but it's easy to imagine how the whole thing could have been done better. ",
            "Not only does it offer no new insights into an issue everyone needs to understand; it's also about as enthralling as watching an investment banker pace his office all day while alternately talking and yelling into the telephone glued onto his ear.",
            " Vague on details regarding the company or the reasons for its impending demise, the film is far more meticulous in painting the possible final hours for this company that unfolds almost like a reverse werewolf tale. ",

            "Margin Call ranks among the top dramas ever made about Wall Street.",
            "Margin Call effectively portrays these masters of the universe as flawed folk who were just as ill-informed, unaware and ultimately scared of losing it all as the general public. ",
            "The movie is about gamesmanship and ruthlessness and what it takes to find room at the top. And stay there.",

            "Such slapstick actually works, reminding us that the clergy are people, too, and the Vatican runs on electricity instead of a higher power.",
            "Always the star of his movies, even when he shouldn't be, the atheist Moretti gets caught up in his own papal bull. But Piccoli's blessed empathy prevails.",
            "This is rich material that Moretti mines for both superficial absurdity and deep pathos. But he refuses to forge an orthodox happy ending, let alone a tinny satire.",
            "We Have a Pope takes its shots at the institution of the Catholic Church, but this is by no means a scathing satire. It's more of a character study, insightful and nuanced, about a man grappling with a profound sense of inadequacy, questioning himself.",
            "Though skeptical, the film isn't at all mean-spirited.",
            "\"We Have a Pope\" is a nuanced, moving and profoundly humane exploration of doubt, faith, weakness and resolve.",
            "A completely agreeable but exceedingly slight film that never seems to have progressed past the conceptual stage.",
            "A hugely enjoyable experience that's sadly let down by a rather lacklustre and uninspiring ending.",
            "Pitching him as an existentialist fugitive who drifts round department stores and into bars trying to reconnect with the world again, Piccoli's performance takes the film to a very sombre place.",
            "Cocooned in humor, lampooning the processes and players of religious politics, [Nanni] Moretti manages to raise serious questions that land with more impact than if they had been treated in a deadly serious manner. ",
            "[Nanni] Moretti pushes on to tell his story thoughtfully, with humor and deep humanity.",
            "Director and star Moretti is improbably likable as a sometimes smug psychiatrist. The entire supporting cast is composed of character actors with extraordinarily expressive faces. But the standout is Michel Piccoli in the lead.",
            "While We Have a Pope contains an interesting idea for a film, it ultimately fails to portray the struggle Cardinal Melville is going through, which is the centerpiece of the entire film.",
            "This is certainly a great idea for a film, it just needs better execution, less stalling for and wasting of time, and a better means of showing the difficult period that Cardinal Melville is going through.",
            "To its great credit, just before the credits, We Have A Pope slips away from its droll dramedy and offers a sharp anticlimax--a pointed stab at Catholicism now. The declaration of its title turns out to be the emptiest statement of all.",
            "While Moretti is as secular as the character he plays in the film, he gives us a papal portrait that's nuanced and counterintuitive; we're used to the humanity of popes evinced as Borgian lust and avarice, not as self-doubt and humility.",
            "Vatican-based comedy could have been sharper",
            "Piccoli, a veteran of European cinema, carries Melville with dejected grace.",
            "The premise is truly inspired, the settings are handsome, and the 86-year-old Piccoli is superb in the role of a reluctant Vicar of Christ, his doubts and hopes and fears playing across his face like clouds.",
            "Are we more fascinated by a peek inside the Vatican walls or by this portrait of a humble man who would rather watch a Chekhov play than pontificate?",
            "It isn't quite a religious experience, but it is a sweet one. In other words: We have a charmer.",
            "\"We Have a Pope\" has great heart.",
            "Moretti's latest work looks at the church sympathetically, veristically, comically.",
            "Like the bulk of the story, the movie itself just seems to be marking time, waiting for someone to take charge."

            "This dark, slickly-made comedy consists of many laugh-out-loud moments.",
            "Imran Khan has every right to expect broader international recognition after his leading man turn in Delhi Belly...Given Hollywood's paucity of genuinely likable 25-35 year-old support players, Khan is a serious contender.",
            "Crosses cultural - and taste - barriers with a joie de vivre that'll have even the Bollywood-averse belly laughing along too.",
            "A smartly paced, highly entertaining Bollywood gagfest.",
            "The most enjoyably subversive element is Poorna Jagannathan as the self-sufficient bachelorette who waylays Tashi on his way to the altar.",
            "Das and Kapur make for effective sidekicks, it's pacy, fitfully funny and, in its determination to upend cultural expectations, likeably mischievous."

            "... at its core, Beginners is about finding happiness, even at the end.",
            "Mike Mills treats love and loss with a disarming tenderness and a refusal of sentimentality that make Beginners, his second feature, something of an anomaly among male identity flicks. What a finely wrought, wryly funny, transcendently sad movie this is.",
            "A quietly moving, delicately mounted romantic drama that touches the heart with resorting to melodrama or an over-reliance on conflict. ",
            "Beginners is perceptive, funny and moving.",
            "One can only regret this writer-director's decision to cram so much material into the mix that some fine understated performances, and much of the film's emotional impact, are obscured along the way.",

            "Moving and intelligent, with a truly great cast.",
            "Beginners wants to say something profound about the difficulties of committing to love, but Hal and Oliver are the only characters who come across as full-fledged people.",
            "Every part of the film fits together perfectly, be it the acting, characters, story, direction; they're all perfect.",
            "Plummer will take your breath away. As a man who learns it's never to late to fall in love (or lust), he may have wrapped up a best supporting Oscar.",

            "Beginners, beyond its pervasive atmosphere of melancholy and loss, suffers from a little self-indulgence. It's your typical indie drama.",
            "Plummer, who won an Oscar for this, is that rare actor lucky enough to manage half a century of undiminished dash and elan on screen.",
            "Life begins at death. A funny, engaging romantic dramedy about never being too late to find happiness.",

            "As it stands, veteran director Roger Donaldson and writers Todd Hickey and Robert Tannen instead turn Seeking Justice into a lengthy chase movie that grows ever more ludicrous.",

            "The conceit of showing a pop-culture figure's life out of the limelight is beyond hackneyed, but the film's incongruous visual splendor and Penn's all-or-nothing commitment keep Sorrentino's unabashed folly afloat for a while. ",

            "The cast ... is outstanding, dragging the offbeat story through the occasional look-at-me distractions.",
            "It elicits a form of emotional rapture that is either the story's themes subtly catching up on the viewer or Sorrentino's shamanistic direction papering over the film's cracks",
            "A film that manages to give us a humorous and amusing performance from Penn, who dominates every frame, but resists blending successfully with the rest of the narrative.",
            "This Must Be the Place is somehow simultaneously heavy and light-hearted; the comic element barely there yet tangible, the starker elements significant, though not excessively dwelt upon.",
            "In a world where the useful, the functional has a place, the opposite of what is known as it, is implausible; leftover That's the state of Cheyenne. A film about nothing but meanings. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "It's a beguilingly strange, distancing, even discombobulating venture, at times gently lyrical, at others nightmarish.",
            "As oddly magnetic as Sean Penn's performance is, the film seems more preoccupied with being quirky and puzzling than with telling a cohesive, satisfying story.",
            "\"It would take a week mucking out a pork pie factory to acclimatise for a hamfest as nauseating as this.\"",
            "Penn's Cheyenne is endearing and ultimately a little bit heartbreaking.",

            "Hits some wild notes but never quite finds its niche",
            "Feels like a cult movie waiting to happen, or perhaps a mad experiment gone wrong. Either way, it's worth watching Penn, perhaps unwittingly, taking Jeff Spicoli to the burned-out end we might have guessed for him back at Ridgemont High.",
            "Adjust to the Oscar winner's deadpan cartoon impersonation, and you may get on the wavelength of this quirkfest.",

            "With loss of tension comes loss of involvement and the gradual, delicate progress of Nathalie's inner life that is probably so well captured in prose, turns to an impediment for the screen",

            "Even those who have found Herzog's work lacking in the past will have a hard time writing off Cave of Forgotten Dreams. It's a superb film.",
            "Fascinating artworks by early man, sure, but they're let down by Herzog's long, rambling soliloquies about the history of homosapiens, albino crocodiles, and Baywatch... These sequences would have been right at home in a 45-minute IMAX film. ",
            " Another lovely stanza in the epic poem of humanity that Herzog has been writing for half a century.",

            "Cave of Forgotten Dreams is one of Herzog's most memorable films. Its subject, the 32,000-year-old drawings on the wall of the Chauvet Cave in southern France, is so astonishing that even Herzog's amiable sidetracks can't destroy the wonder."

            "The original Transformers wasn't a great movie, but at least it started out as fun, with Shia LaBeouf as a high-school student who discovers that his new yellow Camaro is actually an Autobot sent to earth to ward off evil Decepticons from their...",
            "A ridiculous and ridiculously fun 154 minutes of utterly unhinged, completely over-the-top robotic mayhem. And with a moral, no less.",

            "Quite likely the film that Michael Bay has been trying to put together all along.",

            "A completely unhinged whirlwind of epic action that is truly astounding.",
            "There's nothing too complex about the film (other than the parade of special effects and explosions), but it's mindless fun that works on its own level.",
            "The obnoxious and ungrateful shall inherit the Autobots, the power and the cash.",
            "the actual Transformers action in Transformers: Dark of the Moon looks great and should please those who enjoy the format. Getting there, however, transforms what should be a brisk set-up into a long haul.",
            "Like its immediate predecessor, Dark of the Moon is loud, dumb, and dull. It's as much an assault on the senses as it is on the intelligence",
            "In the hands of director Michael Bay, this battle is bound to be over the top, and the special effects amaze.",
            "As with most of his films, Michael Bay doesn't take the less-is-more approach when it comes to spectacle. That he saves for his convoluted screenplay and flat human characterizations.",

            "Nowhere near as jaw-droppingly racist as the previous two installments. Is that damning with faint praise?",
            "An overlong ordeal, devoid of excitement and intrigue.",

            "Transformers: Dark Of The Moon is one of the best blockbuster I've seen in years. No other action film can compare to what is undoubtedly Michael Bay's magnum opus, this is the film to beat this summer!",

            "It's a film whose unrelaxed body language screams: \"Give me prizes!\"",
            "For all its gender-bending intrigue, this is a cataclysmically sexless film: seldom has drag felt like such a drag.",
            "The movie is sometimes charged with real tension and passion. And yet Close as Nobbs is an absence.",
            "At once stilted and melodramatic, this is a desperately ill-conceived adaptation of a fascinating story.",
            "It is rather sad, therefore, that an interesting premise seems rather rushed and lacking storytelling skill despite some excellent central performances.",
            "At its core, Albert Nobbs is a portrait of a man paralyzed by solitude in this often powerful, aching portrait of the larger human condition of loneliness.",
            "Like its protagonist, the story almost suffocates from a sense of tidy perfectionism.",
            "The film's theatrical tone is ultimately its one great undoing, and even the most ardent admirer of Close's inescapable talent may be hard-pushed to substantiate this most uncinematic of stage-to-screen adaptations.",
            "I found the film to be a touching and unique look at human sexuality and interaction.",
            "... impeccable photography, idyllic cinematography and first class performances... [Full review in Spanish]",

            "Everything, even the gender-bending, feels like a prop. For such a ripe story, Albert Nobbs is weirdly un-engaging and lacks any real urgency... ",
            "As the pinched, ever-wary, heartbreaking Nobbs, Close gives a tricky, high wire, award-worthy performance yet she commendably resists any temptation to be showy, campy or spectacular in the least.",
            "An unadventurous film that has only the smallest of fires in its belly.",
            "There's no contrived moralizing bridge to modern relevance, no overt nod to contemporary gender politics and no real reason why Close shouldn't get some respect this awards season.",
            "Close, in one of her greatest performances, is quiet, still, almost invisible to those around her. It's not a stunt or an impersonation, it's a perfect realization of what someone in her position might endure just to eat. ",
            "Close's performance is no less sensational than Heath Ledger's as the close mouthed Ennis in Brokeback Mountain.",
            "One's admiration for Close's work becomes more for her versatility and fearlessness than a connection with the character she portrays.",
            "Glenn Close does her best Clay Aiken impression as she pretends to be a male butler in 19th century Ireland.",
            "File under interesting failure, although with three Oscar nominations (Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress and Best Costume), there must surely be people out there somewhere convinced by this relentlessly tasteful affair.",
            "Glenn Close's character couldn't be more buttoned-up, but beneath the reserve she conveys a lifetime of loneliness, hurt and quiet heartache.",
            "...Academy-Award nominated performances might be reason enough to see Albert Nobbs"

            "All things considered, it is a well-wrought piece of entertainment, confidently paced, although its necessary subplots are little more than dutiful filler sandwiched between fight sequences.",
            "Real Steel plays like a glossy commercial lasting over 90 minutes.",
            "The whole thing is both entirely too routine as well as instantly forgettable, a tandem not exactly high on my list of cinematic virtues to extol.",
            "Battling to be heard above the metal-on-metal clangour is a heartwarming (read: terribly soppy) story of a broken family.",
            "It's a surprisingly effective and entertaining techno-sports, father/son, human drama.",
            "I can see myself stumbling across it while trying to find something to watch on late night TV. I'd stop to watch a scene or two, and then quickly move on",
            "The ending is predictable and played out with all the drama that's typical throughout the film. I'd say director Shawn Levy missed the mark on the target audience for this one.",
            "Even though the story is paint by numbers and there really isn't anything new being done in this it is still pretty enjoyable. ",
            "Though initially targeted at younger teenaged boys, Real Steel has somehow made more of itself and become a feel-good movie about redemption both families and adult escapists will applaud.",
            "Real Steel has box office bomb written all over it and yet, miraculously, it is one of the finest family films I have seen in many a moon.",
            "It was nice to be totally surprised by a big-budget movie.",
            "Real Steel earns every single laugh, every single tear, and every single gasp from its audience.",
            "With its tale of redemption, reconnection and triumphant underdogs interwoven with seamless effects boasting a palpable physicality, Real Steel does nothing new but does it well.",
            "It's a film that captures the ethic of those Amblin movies, adding buckets of imagination, too.",
            "Real Steel is real fun - get your bot in the ring!",
            "I don't know where robot boxing falls on your moral spectrum, but I'd take a pre-teen to see Real Steel, as long as we had a long talk afterwards about the evils of product placement. ",
            "A feelgood film about family, friendship and growing up, Real Steel was always going to attract cynicism but it really does a fine job of delivering for a young audience. ",
            "\"It's O.K. We shouldn't mention the movies we're planning to rip off wholesale, anyway. We'll be original and say the movie's based in part on an old short story that was used for a Twilight Zone episode once.\"",

            "Even when you think you know the outcome, this film still has you on the edge of your seat. It's another underdog story, only this underdog is a has-been robot piloted by a has-been fighter and his cast-off son."

            "Attack The Block is my favorite film of 2011.",
            "I'm glad that science-fiction continues to nip at our sense of social consciousness with remarkable storytelling.",
            "Part of what separates Attack the Block from its Spielbergian inspirations... is the sort of reflection on social and racial issues typically left out of popcorn fare.",

            "Equally as offensive as the movie's smorgasbord of smut and violence is the lingering whiff of colonial-era orientalism, a Western predilection for regarding Eastern cultures as innately idle, lascivious, irrational, and thus ripe for intervention.",
            "The Devil's Double simply offers a trip through hell on a one-way track, like a spook-house ride at the amusement park meant to titillate and excite the senses and then deposit the rider/viewer safely on the other side in the full light of day.",
            "A better film would undoubtedly have been a quieter, more reflective one, less tempted by Grand Guignol. But it is very watchable...",

            "A fluffy little romcom that could have been better, but will do nicely until something more daring comes along.",
            "This movie's resemblances to Pretty Woman are a bit worrying.",
            "Somehow, it ends up slaloming along just fine, and Tamsin Egerton continues to corner the market in Sloaney hauteur with extra hot sauce."

            "The acting is exceptional all around, as is the minimalist score.",

            "In addition to Olsen's mesmerizing performance, John Hawkes turns in yet another award-worthy performance as the haunting and unforgettable Patrick.",
            "A long, slow build, where the pressure and apprehension grows and increases steadily throughout, wrapping you in a tight squeezing grip.",
            "Not for all tastes, but the haunting power of the unheralded Olsen's performance is undeniable.",
            "Some viewers will find this a frustrating experience, particularly come the ending. Overall, though, this is a well constructed picture by Sean Durkin and the acting led brilliantly by a new talent in Olsen.",
            "An impressive mood piece and promising debut for [Elizabeth] Olsen, Martha Marcy May Marlene unfortunately lacks the substance to go with its beguiling look and feel. ",
            "The film's one device - cross-cutting very demonstratively between identically rhetorical moments in the commune and the lakeside house - is exceedingly literal and obvious.",

            "Never has the phrase 'creeping horror' been so apt.",
            "Directed and written by first-time feature filmmaker Sean Durkin, Martha is relentless in its unsettled tone, simmering throughout at a feverish level. ",
            "Despite its well-learned manoeuvres, Martha Marcy May Marlene remains solidly within the genre territory... ultimately having little to say about its charged subjects beyond the sum of its largely well-turned effects.",
            "Watching [Elizabeth Olsen] add layer after layer to Martha/Marcy May/Marlene is riveting. ",
            "'Martha Marcy May Marlene' is the vehicle with which the youngest Olsen sister moves out of her famous older twin siblings' shadows, and establishes herself as the serious artist of the family. She's magnificent.",
            "Durkin's swaggeringly confident film utilizes long takes and tension within compositions to conjure an all-consuming sense of unease.",
            "The beauty of Olsen's star-making performance is inarguable.",
            "Martha is a cipher in the mounting drama, but Olsen manages to give her real life with a sort of reverse charisma, curling her physical beauty into poses of aggression or loss.",

            "Joffe, working from his own script, presents the men's lives as evidence of difficult choices, but this pedantic movie is never fully invested in any of them.",
            "Putting aside the many aesthetic problems with this overwrought, over-narrated, and overacted movie, the politics of There Be Dragons make very little sense.",
            "Few films about the Spanish Civil War have been any good -- Pan's Labyrinth being the big exception.",
            "There's an interesting story here, but Joffe never firmly wraps his arms around it.",
            "'There Be Dragons' features no dragons, merely a weak reasoning of the title and just about everything else that happens in the film for that matter.",
            "Joff\u00e9 is out of depth when it comes to Escriv\u00e1's religious experiences. It's clear he wants the film to show how faith works within us, but he does it by resorting to the most hackneyed imagery.",
            "There's a great film to be made about Josemaria Escriva, the founder of the controversial Opus Dei. There are more great films to be made about the complicated Spanish Civil War. This movie, however, is neither.",
            "It's unfortunate director Roland Joff\u00e9 fails to capture real emotion and passion within the religious narrative. Without that perspective, there's no way he can breathe any life into the biopic, much less fire.",
            "The cinematography is gorgeous, the art direction excellent, and the historical sequences, including the battle scenes, seem quite authentic. The visual parallel narrative structure, the subtleness of the religious imagery, works well.",
            "Unsatisfying, lacking the epic feel it was aiming for, and paid-for image-burnishing for the controversial founder of Opus Dei. ",
            "Yes, the film looks beautiful. But unfortunately is stumbles over itself too often to fully realize greatness. ",
            "Despite its high-mindedness, an almost complete misfire...a lopsided film as well as a turgid, boring one.",
            "...whitewashing the origins of the controversial Opus Dei movement, this lesson in unabashed embellishment will fail to excite any but the most starry-eyed Catholic.",
            " I was looking forward to seeing Wes Bentley on-screen again..Alas, he apparently spent the last decade at the Acting with Your Eyebrows Drama School.",
            "A visually stunning, undeniably intriguing saga about a controversial Catholic saint. Overly earnest at times...but this is still one of the more genuinely spiritual contemporary films to hit the big screen.",
            "Ponderous, inflated, overstated Spanish Civil War potboiler displays all of director Roland Joff\u00e9's worst tendencies to full disadvantage.",
            "A movie doesn't need CGI dragons to be exciting. But it does need real characters and conflict -- it needs to be a real story. Here, that story always is just beyond our grasp.",
            "It offers good production values, name performers and insights into the chaos of civil war. But it's too stiff, too cautious, too calculating to feel genuine.",
            "Rarely has a film with so much melodrama been so unengaging.",
            "Even with its modern ambiguity, \"There Be Dragons\" feels stodgy.",
            "Clunk, clunk, squish. That is the sound of the dead language in Roland Joff\u00e9's screenplay for \"There Be Dragons\" as it tramples his would-be epic of the Spanish Civil War into an indigestible pulp.",
            "I like grandeur and richly nuanced storytelling. I also like lobster bisque. But I don't want to drink a gallon of it in a single sitting."

            "[Jessica Chastain] is just as preoccupying here as in the better films she's appeared in this year.",

            "While Take Shelter isn't by any means perfect - writer/director Jeff Nichols could use a refresher course on editing - it's a powerful film, displaying a devolvement into insanity that ultimately proves to be quite visionary.",
            "I could watch Michael Shannon stare at a wall for 90 minutes and still be captivated.",

            "The need to cram in facts and events makes 'Machine Gun Preacher' feel too much like one large and needlessly glossy montage sequence.",

            "it can be a bit... preachy, if you pardon the pun",

            "Despite a competent performance from Butler, Machine Gun Preacher tackles way too much material to present a cohesive onscreen telling of the Sam Childers story.",
            "It's an uncomfortable marriage of sentimental genre conventions and real-life tragedy shown with graphic detail. It does bring you inside the main character's internal struggle, but doesn't seem focused enough as it sways into action film territory.",
            "We're given surprisingly little food for thought when it comes to the question of the complicated tensions between Christian faith and violence.",
            "With all the talk of \"Kony/KONY 2012\" wending its way into the culture, this movie gives a vivid picture of who this villain is and why the world should be doing something about him.",
            "In the end it devolves into something disappointingly ordinary, which, given the proven skills and sensibilities of director Marc Forster ...",
            "The one-note macho man characterization of Childers comes off as a bit boorishly self-righteous.",

            "It is commendable that Gerard Butler, director Marc Foster and writer Jason Keller have tried to bring the issue of child soldiers to as wide an audience as possible - but though its heart may be in the right place, it never finds a steady rhythm.",
            "The film's attempt to tell Childers' story in the context of the bigger horrors being perpetrated in the Sudan feels like an unnecessary burden that Forster's middlebrow approach can't suppo",
            "It's rabble-rousing material, and the final credits, in which we see footage of the real Childers strutting his unedifying stuff, suggest that a documentary would have been the appropriate genre.",
            "Yes, it's yet another story about white people helping poor black folk, but as tales of imperialistic cultural colonialism as spiritual growth go, this one is solid stuff...",
            "Butler, bless him, tries to give us everything here... John Travolta's Wild Hogs, Stallone with a soul, Arnie with a proper mission and Bruce Willis minus the wisecracks, vest and shiny bonce. "

            "It's undeniably beautiful, but it also feels awfully familiar, with the lighthearted mix of comedy and melancholy veering closer to Jeunet's territory than Satrapri's singular wit. ",
            "As sumptuously gratifying as their film is, there's a definite inadequacy in its na\u00efve considerations of love and commitment that casts a hollow pallor over the proceedings. But that's not to say you won't be enchanted by the tragic melancholy.",
            "Chicken with Plums takes the audience into a magical and wonderful space. It provokes a lot of laughs, but was also the only time I saw audience members crying openly and unashamedly.",
            "Satrapi and Paronnaud have developed a signature style - bittersweet in tone and episodic in function, beginning and ending some scenes as though they were ellipses with a slow fade in or out to black. ",

            "Whatever this Times-produced, TV-ready tribute lacks in tension is amply compensated by the pleasure of watching an enthusiast ply the craft he loves.",

            "A man completely free of pretension, a welcome and refreshing change of pace, a kind of throwback to a gentler, less harried era - and one of the most indelible characters to come from a documentary in a long time.",
            "Bill Cunningham... is at least as intriguing as the nameless men and women he presents to the world.",
            "A simply shot documentary, but its subject is anything but plain, as Cunningham oozes the energy of a 21-year-old just starting their career in the hustle and bustle of the big city.",

            "New Yorkers love nothing more than a story about themselves.",
            "Press is careful to keep the focus on Cunningham as he's keeping his focus on those around him.",

            "Demian Bichir gives one of the year's finest leading performances.",

            "...Weitz finds a third character in the form of the L.A. landscape. Appearing entirely Eden-like when we're in the gardens with Carlos, but rundown and seedy when he's in his own element, the city assumes all the dimensions of the American dream itself.",
            "The film's beautiful simplicity is carried massively on the work of Demi\u00e1n Bichir, instantly and surely one of the best performances seen in 2011.",
            "Well-acted, but quite over-hyped -- a melodramatic Mexican-American version of \"Bicycle Thieves.\"",
            "A Better Life is a half-step removed from the Hallmark Hall of Fame.",
            "A Better Life's sense of place and eye for detail are strong, but the too-smooth style and rushed dramatics are at odds with the hardscrabble existence on display.",

            "A well deserved Oscar nomination for Demian Bichir in a film with echoes of The Bicycle Thief.",

            "There isn't much to [Alma's] story, but at 76 minutes, it breezes by as quickly as the changing of a teenager's moods.",

            "Vanishing on 7th Street feels like a classic in the making until we get to know the main characters.",
            "It's a stylish thriller that falls apart under any serious scrutiny, the lack of explanation equally frustrating and compelling at the same time",

            "Unfortunately, Oslo, August 31 is more of a step sideways than anything else, taking the easy way out with a drug-addiction narrative that helps Trier circumvent any major risks and thus preventing him from reaping any major rewards.",
            "What sets Oslo, August 31st apart is the way it entwines the personal with the city: [Joachim] Trier understands that your story is tangled up in the story of the city and that the story of the city is tangled up in the story of its inhabitants.",

            "Michelle Williams is now the only Dawson's Creek cast member with a chat-worthy film career.",
            "Imagine a collaboration between John Ford and Wallace Stevens and you might get a sense of what Kelly Reichardt pulls off here: a sincere re-creation of the pioneer experience, brought to life through careful, often unexpected detail.",
            "Greatly enhanced by the performances of Michelle Williams and Bruce Greenwood, director Kelly Reichardt's film quietly becomes engrossing - it almost sneaks up on you.",
            "There are stretches that are, frankly, boring. But the vivid details and intimacy you develop with these travelers sticks with you, leaving you in awe of the insane feats people had to accomplish in order for us to enjoy the world we know today.",
            "A mesmerizing cinematic journey that is often as arduous and spare as the lives of its hard-bitten protagonists.",
            "This is the sort of film critics love to praise because the filmmaker has done good work before; and well, there must be something there. Well, there's not.",
            "Meek's Cutoff could be the most understated, and historically accurate, horror film in history. It's both the scariest and most poetic film of the year.",
            "[T]his story is one in which the audience will become so invested in the unvarnished struggle, the hardship... that one can't help but walk away from the theatre with a new sense of understanding and appreciation for America's history.",
            "[Director Kelly] Reichardt, who previously directed Williams in Wendy and Lucy, shows us with great subtlety the physical and emotional drama here, one that's properly underplayed, given the strictures of the time.",
            "Certainly, the film is grim in many ways, but there is also great, almost astonishing, beauty. . .",
            "It's a severe life in a hostile world, observed with such delicate detail that the film achieves a grace and poetry. But it is also a primal piece of filmmaking, wrought from dirt and rock and calico, illuminated by natural light and campfire.",
            "I was hypnotized from the opening sequence.",
            "Meek's Cutoff is a thoughtful, and intimate narrative that is beautifully shot and has outstanding direction.",
            "Reichardt's film is - to put it simply - a masterpiece.",
            "presented people who were so devoid of personality, humor and interest that I didn't care if any of them made it out alive",
            "The film is both evocative and provocative; atmospherically and conceptually, respectively.",
            "I rarely feel the heart-in-my-throat suspense that I felt as Reichardt's characters sent a covered wagon down a steep hill ...",
            "A better complement than 'The Big Trail' would be 'The Blair Witch Project,' another film that taps into an American unease with the wilderness that is the shadow twin of the country's bold sense of manifest destiny.",
            "I felt like I was trapped on a slow-moving wagon train to nowhere with a bunch of people I wanted to escape from.",
            "Reichardt puts such an unequivocal spin on this well-trod territory as to make it feel heretofore uncharted and of her own reckoning.",
            "Offbeat and most interesting western about emigrant pioneers lost in the prairie.",
            "... a primal piece of filmmaking, wrought from dirt and rock, calico and splintered wood, and illuminated by natural light and campfire.",
            "Be warned. Some stretches are almost as much of a slog for the viewer as they are for the pioneers... But Meek's Cutoff conveys a far more realistic account of what life was really like on the frontier trail than John Wayne or Clint Eastwood ever did."

            "Overall, Jolie has nothing to be embarrassed about and much of which to be proud with this movie. Even in moments where the film doesn't quite work, she shows ample evidence of ambition and a discerning director's eye.",
            "Jolie, however, shows great promise as a visual storyteller, even though this love story is stretched too thinly.",
            "Never less than competent, it's clearly the result of a sincere, long-harboured desire to raise awareness of these horrific, dehumanising events.",
            "Jolie's grasp of the material is confident enough to mean that her film never slows down, or loses its way.",
            "This is an often impressive first feature and clearly a sincere and hard-hitting exposure of a terrible time.",
            "The film's key twist seems a bit underdeveloped, but there's no avoiding the horror the film captures. Even in modern times, what monsters men can be.",
            "In the Land of Blood and Honey is a surprisingly ambitious, nuanced study of the collision of human psychology with the black-and-white lines war presumes.",
            "The film also at times drags on a bit too long. It seems trying to fit in a little bit of time from each year of the war was a bit too much and not needed to get across the themes and point of the film. ",
            "Set against the backdrop of the war, violent and graphic and made with no apologies... is the story of love, conflict and the emotional, ethical, physical and moral toll it takes not only on individuals, but on people as a whole.",
            "In fighting for equality on all fronts, Jolie makes a compelling case for a world where labels don't matter, including those that would brand her as a celebrity rather than as a filmmaker. No argument here.",
            "[An] atrocious script and misguided approach to the subject matter render In the Land of Blood and Honey odious.",
            "In The Land Of Blood And Honey is a compelling story that is enhanced by the well-researched portrayal of the politics behind the conflict and the ways that people were made to cope.",
            "...not incompetently made, and it suggests that Jolie might have a real shot at someday being a very good director. But it leaves us with a feeling so queasy and uncomfortable one hesitates to give it voice: Could she really think this dynamic is sexy?",
            "Jolie never shies away from the horrors of war, with scene after scene of ethnic cleansing and war atrocities, but it suffers from an emotionally distant script and some weird editing that make the film's languid pace even more noticeable.",
            "It's a good movie on a great subject, even if it is well short of a great film.",
            "Jolie wants to tell a tragic love story amid the ruins, between a Serb and a Muslim, but she can never get a bead on who these two people are or how they feel about each other. ",
            "In the Land of Blood and Honey is a relentless, disturbing chronicle of cruelty. It is bleak and brutal. Angelina Jolie is showing this could be -- and still is -- happening in other parts of the world.",
            "A brilliant debut written and directed by Jolie. She has an artist's eye, strong personal vision, and a masterful command of her stars. ",
            "[T]hough it is written and directed by actress Angelina Jolie... there is nothing 'Hollywood' about this film: it stars local actors and is in the local languages, and it shies not one whit from the horrors of the war.",
            "It's a tough, clear-eyed look at a ghastly ethnic war, with an admirably wide perspective that affords compassion for both sides.",
            "With its broad strokes, this invitation to an important discussion is hard to ignore, but the blood and honey on the table is an unpalatable mix.",
            "Sincere and ambitious yet inadequate...",
            "Although Jolie's good intentions are easy to admire, those characters are hard to believe, and the bloody narrative has an oddly bloodless effect.",
            "Jolie has a number of things on her side here, including a superb cast that is mostly unknown to western viewers -- always a boon to the willing suspension of disbelief."

            "It's a quietly thoughtful film that eschews cheap sentimentality and - through the assured performance of Rahim - demonstrates that good can come from the most unlikely places.",
            "Enjoyable French wartime drama that brings a new perspective to a familiar story and features a compelling central performance from Tahar Rahim, but the plot is occasionally frustrating and appears to lack direction.",
            "It may lack the punch of his turn in A Prophet, but Rahim again dominates the screen in an effective wartime thriller.",
            "Modest in both budget and impact, it's nonetheless intelligently executed...",
            "Loosely based on real events, this espionage drama set during World War II focuses on the largely overlooked cooperation between Arabic immigrants and the French Resistance.",
            "One of those espionage/war movies in which the usual thrilling chases and shootouts take a back seat to the transformations that occur in the protagonists' minds.",
            "[Rahim] is the engine running the ship, the command center through which everything else must flow through, the young actor quickly becoming one of the best and most interesting working today.",
            "A cannily shot thriller.",
            "The film benefits greatly from Rahim's subtle, effective performance; and it's inevitably heartening to see Jewish and Muslim Algerians identify themselves in national, not ethnic or religious, terms, while fighting a common enemy.",
            "Rahim has the eyes of the young Mandy Patinkin. If only he had some of the wildness.",
            "Ferroukhi evokes the unusual setting of his film, the Arab community in war-time Paris, with specificity and brooding atmosphere.",

            "What makes this film special and memorable is the character of Danny Green, who is not the usual neighborhood hoodlum you see in movies, the kind who gets in deep and gradually loses his soul.",
            "Stevenson is big and swarthy and not altogether without credibility, but he's got as much charisma as a potato.",
            "The problem is that writer-director Jonathan Hensleigh doesn't do much beyond filling in the template; he's telling the specific, true-life tale of mob decline in 1970s Cleveland, but every character and setpiece feels like it fell off a truck.",
            "There's an irresistible, Cleveland-esque, underdog quality about this whole production.",

            "A solid indie action flick with a strong ensemble cast.",

            "Electing to shoot in Detroit was a wise choice, not only for the great tax incentives for filmmakers, but also for the fact it has very depressed areas reminiscent of the 70's period, exemplifying the essence and look of a gritty Great Lakes port city.",
            "Kill the Irishman tries a little too hard for an emotional impact it can't achieve, but it still tells an engrossing story about an interesting man living in interesting times. ",
            "KILL THE IRISHMAN should be appreciated as an important look at the way Greene affected the mob and crimes back in the late 70s.",
            " A synthesis of stuff we've seen in every gangster movie since the '70s",
            "Hensleigh wields the techniques with a sure hand and uses them to construct a compelling, engaging narrative, but at the same time seasoned viewers will constantly feel a nagging sense of familiarity.",
            "It's a small-scale film, but it packs a solid punch.",
            "A certain clenched-fist tonality to the picture that helps it wade through routine, and it's nice to see the city of Cleveland used for change when detailing the horrors and intimidation of mob rule, giving NYC the day off. ",
            "It's not just that the movie appears to find Greene far more charming than he was in Porrello's book. It's that Kill the Irishman never brings either freshness or energy to its tale. In the end, even the many explosions seem tired.",
            "It's great summer night slumming cinema, with an integral moral complexity that doesn't intrude but guides the action.",
            "A minor mob-cinema classic.",
            "...suffers from the twin deficits of a charm-free leading man and a screenplay that seems composed of dialogue and scenes written and then discarded by writers working on better films.",

            "Will hardly replace the classic gangster flicks, but it's a pretty good little account of an episode in American mob history that had surprisingly wide-ranging ramifications."

            "Offers a fascinating imaginary sequel to the story of Butch and Sundance.",
            "A Western in possession of a social conscience, but without lapsing into preaching or patronising, this is an unassuming film in some ways, but ultimately it's self-assured, elegiac and sometimes strikingly beautiful.",

            "Whereas Jacobs p\u00e8re has been most concerned for the past four decades with using cinema as an instrument for exploring the mechanics and boundaries of visual perception, Jacobs fils is less a mad scientist than a misfit bard.",
            "Lest you think that you've already seen every possible variation on the outsider-nerd story, Terri keeps plenty of surprises up its pit-stained sleeves.",
            "Jacob Wysocki infuses his performance in the title role with precisely that same duality, turning Terri into an oversized portrait of adolescence -- so naive yet so wise, strangely believable and believably strange. ",
            "Its charms feel somewhat calculated, but this reflective tale of outsider solitude has enough humor and poignancy to win admirers.",
            "A sweet and subtle comedy about the awkwardness of adolescence.",
            "Terri may be strange, but it's a good, heartfelt strange that resonates long after the film ends.",
            "Absolutely wonderful.",
            "Touching the heart and warming the soul, Terri is a soft-spoken story of hope and joy that makes the ordinary extraordinary.",
            "[Writer-director Azazel Jacobs] clearly has an eye and an ear for the confused rhythms of human life.",
            "Terri examines the freakery and geekery of puberty not with Miguel Arteta's clamminess but with the serene, compassionate excruciation that's become Jacobs' distinctive timbre.",
            "What makes it good is the solidity of the scenes, something that owes both to novelist Patrick deWitt's honed scripting and the naturalistic cadence of Jacobs' direction.",
            "Jacobs has a knack for hanging back and allowing movies to grow on you. It gathers power as it goes.",
            "Terri is a very funny film with strong performances and equally strong direction.",
            "...An enjoyable coming-of-age film but a few of the darker sequences and the general feeling that you've seen this story before might keep it from being a larger success.",
            " \"Terri\" has one leaving the theater thinking \"And?\"",
            "Like its eponymous protagonist, Terri sits awkwardly outside mainstream expectations, but is all the more appealing for it.",
            "Terri is at least an interesting movie, though it lacks any sort of direct overcoming of the conflict, and things piddle out in the end.",
            "Terri leaves an unsatisfying taste and, as memories of its moments of charm and even insight fade, it only grows bitterer.",
            "Funny and perky but unlike most Fox Searchlight films, never saccharine.",
            "A winningly understated performance from John C. Reilly and a potentially star-making turn from lead Jacob Wysocki help place Terri's firm finger on the pulse of the often senselessly cruel high school experience.",
            "Terri was shot in just a couple locations on a tiny budget, but it sense of heightened reality and terrific performances make it a strangely touching story.",
            "The film's less-than-engrossing atmosphere is compounded by Wysocki's competent yet charmless performance...",
            "Crafted with care and imagined with empathy, but the nicely realized scenes don't add up to a satisfying whole."

            "It has its flaws, but I defy you to find a more intelligent or impassioned American film this year.",

            "Had I seen Margaret in 2011 it would have likely been number two or three on my list of the best films of the year.",
            "I highly recommend investing in the extended cut of this important drama. You'll be forced to wrestle with the meaning of justice...",

            "Margaret has some intriguing ideas that don't often get dramatized in this fashion, and it has a fine cast bringing it to life. Still, like its young protagonist, sometimes it comes off as a bit too self-righteous and self-involved.",

            "A messy-yet-poignant dramatic opera about the power of regret, loss, and worst of all, being a teenager.",
            "If two and a half hours in the company of quarrelsome, self-absorbed New Yorkers don't sound too punishing, there's much to like.",
            "It has failings, but they're not fundamental, and if anything they speak to just how much Lonergan tried to coerce into a single story. He was aiming for ecstatic transcendence.",
            "Lonergan's brainy script wouldn't work without Paquin, who makes Lisa a force of nature. As a walking paradox -- both controlling and completely out of control -- she's riveting.",
            "Margaret's journey to the screen may've been rocky, but the result is a singularly compelling study of trauma. It's a raw, messily magnificent near-masterpiece.",
            "At 150 minutes, it's way too long, with several superfluous scenes and subplots. On top of all that, moments of high melodrama and overwrought opera suggest that it has an over-inflated sense of its own importance.",
            "Complex, ambitious, remarkably performed; Margaret is a unique film that almost didn't see the light of day.",
            "Margaret is a frayed-nerves feat of furious articulation."

            "Wheatly aims for something like moral complexity by having one of the killers believe in God and the other aspire to be a good husband and father, but once the graphic violence starts, it upstages everything else. ",
            "Displaying both a nasty edge and a playful sense of humor -- but thankfully, never at the same time -- Brit import Kill List is several cuts above its fellow midbudget horror brethren.",
            "Deeply edgy, gory crime film maintains perfectly calibrated tension before dropping a bombshell that will be too much for some viewers.",
            "One of the scariest films I've seen in ages, although I cannot in all honesty explain exactly what the movie is about.",
            "Wheatley's sui generis sophomore effort confirms him as a weasel to watch under the cocktail cabinet for.",
            "It just barely works for me by virtue of its audacity but I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't do the same for you. ",
            "An element of the occult, of some sinister, unknown outside force encroaching on the narrative, driving characters closer and closer to the brink of madness.",
            "Wheatley is clearly a clever craftsman, but by delving into Wicker Man territory for the film's terrifying denouement, he ends up sacrificing narrative depth for atmosphere. ",
            "Surprisingly dense, difficult, and the most multi-layered thriller you might chance to see in some time, Wheatley's latest is eerie, satisfying, and full of creepy thrills.",
            "An emotional rollercoaster of a film which devastates and amuses in equal measure.",
            "Just as modern politicians convince the common person to vote against their interests, the film's cult promises a return to a past social order if all modernity is sacrificed.",
            "... really bizarre sh*t starts happening, and then continues to build at an avalanche pace through the end-which will leave you saying, \"WAIT. What. Just. Happened??!??!?\"",
            "Still, Kill List is well worth seeing. If it's not entirely the shocker that seems intended, it's certainly creepy, funny and startlingly lifelike for most of its running time, and that's mainly what counts. ",
            "Wheatley cycles through the genres as the killing spree begins, but the ambiguity that is initially its strength becomes a weakness by the end.",
            "Kill List will scar you emotionally. Do yourselves a favour and don't watch this before bed. ",
            "As gross and horrific as some of the acts are, the pacing, character deterioration, story turns and sympathetic portrayals (if a hitman could ever fall into that category) make this film compelling viewing.",
            "Progresses from uncomfortable character study to subtly intense crime thriller, and ultimately to deep, dark horror.",
            "When it's all over, audiences are sent reeling out of the theater with heads spinning and guts churning.",
            "Kill List is bravura filmmaking - an impeccable guide on how to build tension and character without sacrificing story.",
            "Kill List is a tremendous film that features a nerve shredding climax that shook me to the core, skilfully edited and cruelly turning the tables on the main characters in ways you never expected.",
            "A moody, scary, often exceptional film that tries so hard to keep the viewer at a distance that it actually succeeds too well.",
            "Martin Pavey's sound design is so unnerving it scared the bejeezus out of our cats...",
            "It's a bit of a slow starter, but once it gets going, Kill List achieves a steady, nail-gnawing intensity and unpredictability. ",
            "Ben Wheatley might one day make a film of interest as long as he nails down a few particulars before heading to the set."

            "A quirky film that's served well by its great cast, but not enough to impress me that it had any depth.",
            "An unlikeable main character and a weak narrative flow turn Hesher into a mediocre film.",

            "Fortunately, there's enough humor in all this to counteract the exploitation of weird logic and audacious coincidence.",
            "Susser cowrote the script, which relies on moments of profanity and impulsive violence to elicit terse little laughs and a melodramatic backstory to signal emotional resonance.",
            "Powered by a character at once original and representational, Hesher courses with a unique verve missing in many independent productions, hovering somewhere between outright success and 'interesting failure.'",
            "Since [Gordon-Levitt's] one of the most energetic and inventive young actors in the business, you can't take your eyes off him. Unfortunately, the quality of the material makes you wish you could. ",
            "Headbangs straight into your heart.",
            "While it arrives decorated with cooler hair and a louder soundtrack, it still sticks to the \"Unusual Outsider Teaches Middle-Class People What It Means to Really Live\" template.",

            "The strength of Hesher is its acting. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is back to drawing on his natural power as an actor. He's skilled at creating absorbing human trainwrecks.",

            "Joseph Gordon-Levitt must be especially glad for this film to see the light of day, because his performance is award-worthy, a complete inhabiting of as unique a personality as you'll encounter in film."

            "Somehow its posse of American travellers, attempting to reach the Eden of Canada while assailed by vampires, seems a little dull.",

            "Other undead movies needlessly foreground the action. \"Stake Land'' has its fight scenes, but here they're secondary.",
            "Don't misunderstand -- if you want to follow a few tough folks battling their way through a monster-infested world, Stake Land delivers. It just could have been thought out more thoroughly. ",
            "Essentially a far-better-than-average B-movie, slick in presentation and able to keep up a steady pace.",
            " This landscape, although dressed in the trappings of genre, is a thinly veiled exaggeration of America's current, divisive culture wars, with Mickle and Damici leaving little doubt as to where they themselves stand or what is at stake for humanity.",
            "This is no gallows comedy, it's a survival drama in the mode of The Walking Dead. It has more in common with The Road or George Romero's late Dead films than most vampire films...",
            "Stake Land is intelligently rendered horror. It's a cut above more recent efforts, being an accomplished and thoughtful piece of work and an overall, enjoyable watch.",
            "Stake Land has strong characters, a lucid script, plenty of action, and something more substantial to make it better-than-average.",
            "May be the best blunt-force-trauma, tear-your-throat-out vicious vampire film since Near Dark.",
            "it's as dark as Harry Potter 19 might have been, and keener on exploring deeper themes than having an all-slaying, all-spurting, all-squirting orgy of fangbanging fun.",
            "More admirable than fulfilling, expelling more effort with atmosphere than story, wasting time with stares when legitimate tension is desperately needed.",
            "What sets this movie apart, however, is the appearance of a bizarre religious cult that could be more dangerous than the monsters. If only it had gone farther...",
            "There's a scruffy immediacy to the direction... but also a grace to the imagery and a commitment to the performances.",
            "The Road on supernatural steroids, the New York Times called it, and that's a pretty good short handle for it. ",
            "Although admirable for a low budget horror thriller, this is let down by inept storytelling.",
            "In Stake Land, the latest post-apocalyptic vision to hit cinemas, it is not vampire or cannibals you have to watch out for, but those nutters in the Christian right and all of the offensive caricature that comes with them.",
            "Like the film version of Cormac McCarthy's The Road, it has quasi-religious overtones and one very good scene...",
            "A super- low-budget-yet-visually-evocative genre movie done with almost utter earnestness.",
            "Jim Mickle is a fine genre filmmaker and Stake Land is a satisfying entrant in the 'post-modern vampire film' subset; if a little undernourished, it's still enough to whet fan appetite for his next project. ",
            "Even when it's only got its vampire wings on, this film has a lot more bite than the Twilight series."

            "If you're already an Adri\u00e0-convert then seeing the great gastronome at work may well be more than enough of a draw -- just don't expect to learn anything profound about him or his unique culinary approach for the proceeding 148 minutes.",
            "Not only does the food look barely edible but the film is remarkably unilluminating about the history of the restaurant, the characters or those who ate there.",
            "The result is hypnotic rather than instructive and, like TV cookery programmes, it's a cinematic experience resembling lap dancing overseen by a duenna.",
            "Offers a fascinating glimpse into the world of culinary science and it's hard not to marvel at the skill and expertise on display, but the fly-on-the-wall style strips the film of context and it ultimately becomes a little dull.",

            "Legendary chef Ferran Adri\u00e0's philosophising about pushing new food frontiers is fascinating, but barely glimpsed, so keen is the film on recording the appliance of science to innocent ingredients.",
            "...will appeal to two types of people: those with a deep and highly specific interest in the art of cooking, and those interested in extreme craftsmanship as practiced in any line of work",
            "You leave \"Cooking in Progress\" with respect for a man who followed his vision, and with fascination at the idea of food as artistic expression.",
            "If you're passionate (and open-minded) about food, you'll be fascinated.",

            "Director Wetzel doesn't so much explain the surreal mindset of Adri\u00e0 as he does simply hang out and film the proceedings. But seriously, what revolutionary proceedings they are.",
            "It's intermittently fascinating, but this strictly fly-on-the-wall doco sometimes feels tedious and soulless.",
            "If your idea of fine dining is pumpkin meringue sandwiches, bone marrow tartare with oysters, tea shrimp with caviar anemones, and ice vinaigrette with tangerines and green olive, then by all means make haste to El Bulli."

            "Dreams Of A Life is an investigation into the life of one Joyce Vincent; but it's one of those cases that may never be completely solved, leaving the viewer in a positively comtemplative state.",
            "Somewhere at the bottom of this story is an ache about the value of a life.",
            "Its holes or omissions cannot diminish the gaping eloquence of the situation and the questions that arise.",
            "Dreams of a Life unintentionally amounts to a mean-spirited snooze.",
            "For all its subtext about identity and London's social fabric, \"Dreams of a Life\" leaves too many blanks and is ultimately more frustrating than rewarding.",
            "A riveting tale of a onetime vivacious personality, described by those who knew her as \"stunning,\" \"lovely,\" and \"very well liked,\" but who nevertheless died alone, friendless and seemingly missed by nobody.",
            "The film examines just how precious every single life is, how closely we are connected to other people, and how important it is to never lose that connection.",
            "It's a film that causes you to reflect on your own life. If I died, how long would it take for me to be found? Who would come looking for me first? But it's also a reflection on the unknowability of other people.",
            "Dreams of a Life is a poignant reflection on the value of relationships and the necessity of connection. [Carol] Morley presents a reminder that the smallest act of re-connection may turn out to have a much bigger effect.",
            "A warm-hearted and deeply moving ode to Joyce Carol Vincent.",
            "How awfully, strangely death can void a personal identity. The filling-in of the chalk outline remains sketchy, as Morley well knows. This docu-obituary's sharply aware of its own bit-ness, its partial-ness.",
            " I like how Morely juxtaposes urban life with inner life, and how the two don't always intersect. ",
            "Disappointing documentary-fiction hybrid on the true story of a woman found dead and alone in an apartment three years after her demise. A pile-up of unanswered questions and unidentified witnesses frustrates more than it intrigues.",
            "Director Morley has at least restored something of a soul to her subject.",
            "Left with barely any there there, Morley compensates with long reenactments starring look-alike Zawe Ashton that are never quite convincing but instead suck more air out of the haunting vacuum left behind in Vincent's wake.",
            "Dreams of a Life succeeds in making its point about the unkowability of the people in our lives, but there isn't quite enough substance here to fully sustain the film.",
            "Stunningly perplexing ... while it does leave you terribly bummed out in the end, it also leaves you with a whole lot of questions.",
            "It's a fascinating film, skilfully assembled, and one is inevitably reminded of Citizen Kane and Rashomon...",
            "What results is an impressionistic study of how the big city can envelope a person until there is almost nothing left except what bits and pieces acquaintances can remember.",
            "It is necessarily incomplete but still constructs a haunting portrait of a woman who deserved a better life and death.",
            "Makes for queazy viewing.",
            "She may have been forgotten in life, but Joyce Vincent will haunt anyone who watches this astonishing film.",
            "The problem - and it's a glaring one - is that Morley imposes a creative stamp on the material that keeps getting in the way.",
            "It isn't just the mystery that mesmerises, it is the misery or the apprehension of it: the sense of some untold, secret pain that had been Vincent's constant companion."

            "It's rather stunning, but sometime down the line, our beloved Conan O'Brien ... he turned into Larry Sanders.",
            "The film captures the exhaustive healing process he had to endure to emerge (relatively) cleansed.",
            "...depicts a fiercely talented performer who has created...a temple to his own cult. While the resulting spectacle may be distasteful in its egotism and indulgence, there's no doubting the drive and devotion of a man for whom the world truly is a stage.",
            "The movie is pretty standard behind-the-scenes fare most of the time, but kudos to O'Brien for allowing the filmmakers to portray him in a light that's not always flattering.",
            "An alternately revealing and concealing vanity project that gives O'Brien a chance to vent his anger, ventilate his underlings (with his rapier wit) and play rock star alongside such celebrity enablers as Eddie Vedder and Jack White.",
            "...a compact, compelling study of the classic manic comic personality in full overdrive.",
            "It's (the) insight and honesty that elevates the film, transforming it into an inspiring -- if a shade or two less than truly intimate -- portrait of an immensely likable man",
            "For supporters of Coco who want some insight in to their folk hero who is one part egomaniac, one part eager to please clown, and one part average Joe looking for the American dream.",
            "For the most part, Conan O'Brien Can't Stop plays like a fairly typical tour documentary...",
            "Some of the concert footage and backstage banter with the writers is extremely funny, but the funny is in shorter supply than you'd expect.",
            "The shows themselves are tremendous fun, and Flender crams so much backstage detail into the doc that we're swept up in the whirlwind of manic action along with everyone else.",

            "Beyond the love fest of talking heads is a compelling life story that courses through the Depression, World War II and swinging London, all evoked in well-curated archival footage.",
            "A quite fawning but nonetheless solidly engaging look at the iconic stylist which benefits chiefly from its subject's extremely personable nature.",
            "Audience appeal will be limited to people who see nothing silly about saying the man who invented the five-point haircut was one of the primary architects of the '60s."

            "As maddeningly undisciplined as the movie community she's exploring, but it still stands as a worthy historical document of NYC's recent past and the birth of a new way of making films.",

            "Contains some interesting and amusing 'No Wave' anecdotes, but director Celine Danhier doesn't form a cogent narrative spine from all of her interviews.",

            "If \"Rubber'' was half as smart as it is clever, we might be talking gonzo midnight four-star classic here.",
            "\"Rubber\" is a silly thing. But it doesn't stop at silly.",
            "Sometimes, life has no reason... and then the movie about a malevolent telekinetic tire gets into full swing. Fun times!",
            "In the hands of nearly any other filmmaker, the result probably wouldn't match the standards expected even by the least discerning Troma Studio devotee.",
            "Rubber may not be everyone's comedic go-to, but certainly it's a sui generis indie that doesn't portend to be anything more than its 86 minutes.",

            "The greatest meta movie about a killer tire ever made.",
            "The killer tire concept is great and the bizarre humor works very well, making this a wholly enjoyable film.",
            "This is a movie about how watching movies is stupid.",
            "Rubber won't be everyone's cup of tea, but as curios go, it's among the more watchable movies about killer tyres you're likely to see this year.",
            "Director Dupieux makes the most of his low budget with a wicked eye for the camera, and expertly timed gags, FX and performances make Rubber more art-house than Troma. ",
            "Rubber deserves praise (and a viewing) if only for its absurd spirit alone, but the film is probably best digested when applying its self-proclaimed \"no reason\" logic to understanding it as a whole.",
            "The 82-minute film feels a bit stretched, but not as much as you'd expect with a premise this odd.",
            " a hipster movie, affectedly exhausted and cocksure with no justification for it. And like anything hipster, you sort of want to kick it in the teeth.",
            "The result is something akin to Luis Bunuel or Samuel Beckett making a 70s exploitation film.",
            "Audicious and wonderfully offbeat ... it's a fun one to talk about -- if only for the opportunity to shake your head in amused disbelief at what you just saw.",
            "This movie is totally fantastic.",
            "The amplified sound effects and the remarkable mobility displayed by Bob without resorting to computer-enhanced special effects are the film's greatest strengths. If you have 82 minutes to kill, you may derive a...",
            "Spielberg announced his arrival with a killer truck. By making us believe in a thinking tire, Dupieux has outdone him. Appropriately, in this film's parting shot, the Hollywood sign beckons.",
            "If you see only one film this year about a psychokinetic tire that roams the dusty American southwest exploding the heads of those get in his way, it should definitely be Quentin Dupieux's Rubber."

            "Nicolas Roeg's mid-'70s sci-fi misfire about an alien (Bowie) trying to save his planet but falling prey to Earth's temptations is self-indulgent garble with a haunting premise.",
            "Nicolas Roeg's The Man Who Fell to Earth features a fine performance from David Bowie and a gorgeous production design, but the story is ultimately a choppy, unfocused, and meandering mess that results in a cold and distant film.",
            "Conveying a (sur) real sense of what sex, religion and TV would look like through alien eyes, it's ambitious, artful and unique.",
            "If you're looking for a gripping narrative then look elsewhere; enjoy the B-movie effects and crash zooms, melodramatic acting, eclectic soundtrack, Hockney-esque visuals and Bowie's effortless charisma instead.",
            "This is certainly one of the best bad movies I have ever seen.",

            "It's tempting to watch If a Tree Falls doc about a scraggly group of ecoterrorists with a chip of skepticism on your shoulder. Yet the film creates a fantastic moral ambivalence.",
            "Curry tells a compelling tale about the differences of opinion over what constitutes desperate measures, and how readily we throw around a term like terrorism.",
            "The problem is that the heart of the movie is McGowan. He's just not a very compelling figure.",
            "The gripping documentary If a Tree Falls: A Story of the Earth Liberation Front offers an intimate look at the radical environmental group.",
            "Unless you are a true believer in the tenets of deep ecology, the film may seem more like an apology for the group's dangerous activities.",
            "An informative, if troubling, narrative about the future of the environmental movement.",
            "The film is edited together well, telling two different stories in parallel, though this duel story line does cause a few hiccups in pacing as the transition is made back and forth.",
            "The film centers around the story of Dan McGowan, a member of ELF who was arrested in an FBI sweep of radical environmentalists in 2005.",
            "As emotive and far-reaching as the issues involved are, this incisive feature is most potent when capturing Daniel McGowan's life and mind dismantling.",
            "Now locked down as a terrorist in America's CMU system, ELF activist Daniel McGowan lit more than a few fires.",
            "The film is a fascinating look inside a little-known arm of the larger environmental movement.",
            "An earnest and even-handed documentary about a naive and whiny mild-mannered thirtysomething ecology activist.",
            "Considerably more thought-provoking than expected.",
            "Although kind to the plights of activists who face hard time for victimless crimes, this film is balanced -- conservatives could easily interpret it as validation of the group's persecution.",
            "McGowan's views on the environment have taken several turns, but none of them is illustrated in the film, in which he comes off as passive and a little whiny.",
            "An intelligent look at civil disobedience and the official criminalization of enviros who take peaceful demonstrations one step further.",
            "\"If a Tree Falls\" never loses sight of the human beings at the heart of the conflict -- no matter what side of the conflict they're on.",
            "Gets a bit bogged down in legal and procedural details during its final 30 minutes but it will, hopefully, open eyes and hearts.",
            "It serves an important purpose in calling attention to environmental issues. In today's political climate, environmentalism only gets discussed in the context of job creation or monetary savings.",
            "Despite their efforts to address most sides of this complex story, each new interview leaves us wanting to know even more.",
            "The story of how a muscular anti-logging campaign devolved into sectarian turmoil that shot off radicalized cells like burning cinders is ultimately what drives the film and makes it so rewarding",
            "Considering its incendiary subject, Curry's approach is disarmingly tame; perhaps reframing the debate in less volatile terms is some kind of lukewarm triumph.",
            "This is a sterling example of journalistic documentary, clearer, fairer and more engrossing than any of the sensationalistic newspaper or magazine stories about ELF.",
            "Though it is amusing watching the ring fall apart, \"Goodfellas\"-style, as the terrorists rat on each other, the film's sense of grievance will be shared by few."

            "What comes through most clearly in Limelight, however, is that Chaplin had come to terms with his life.",
            "Intended as a tragicomedy, if not a tearjerker, it is a two-thirds bore that comes to life in the last half-hour or so, when the old-master clown stops trying to be pathetic and reverts to his inimitable proper stuff.",
            "Elements of self parody from the master of slapstick leave you yearning for the early work that made his name. But it's worth a watch to see Chaplin and Keaton in one of few on-screen appearances together.",
            "Departing from most forms of Hollywood stereotype, the film has a flavor all its own in the sincere quality of the story anent the onetime great vaudemime and his rescue of a femme ballet student.",
            "Neither comedy nor tragedy altogether, it is a brilliant weaving of comic and tragic strands, eloquent, tearful and beguiling with supreme virtuosity.",
            "Few cinema artists have delved into their own lives and emotions with such ruthlessness and with such moving results.",
            "Throughout, Chaplin's comedy-drama doesn't produce one belly laugh, but hardly a gesture in it Jacks grace, point, or perfection.",
            "Limelight plays like a very personal, sincere work from an artist who seems to have accepted the inevitability of changing times and tastes. Sweet, sad, and often amusing, it's the Tramp's last great appearance on film.",
            "Chaplin might not be \"the tramp\" character from before (in the strictest sense), but his aging clown definitely retains some familiar characteristics.",
            "To me it seems one of the finest things Chaplin has ever done. Not even an occasional draggy or garrulous episode can detract seriously from the incomparable grace and wit and humanity which abound in this picture...",
            "Limelight is loaded with excellent song and dance numbers that remind us that life may be tough, but there is no reason to get mired in it.",
            "With Limelight, for one last, brief moment, it's like old times even as the new age begins and Chaplin relinquishes his crown to the younger generations. ",
            "It was Chaplin's last great film, and it showcases not just a love for the performing arts (she's a ballerina, he's a vaudevillian), but also Chaplin's effortless sentimentality.",
            "This somewhat autobiographical piece goes heavy on the melodrama and employs humor in short bursts.",
            "Some have also accused Limelight of being too sentimental, but we'd argue that's part of its charm.",
            "Chaplin, as usual, is the whole show, superb in this swansong statement about his own career and the old-style entertainment he best represented.",
            "Limelight seems stuck in time, even for 1952. The un-ironic pathos and sentimental humanism seems almost quaint in the post-Hitler world. But that's Chaplin for you - a man who lived by, and wrote, his own rules.",
            "Chaplin's least funny film.",
            "Premiering in 1952 when Chaplin was 63 years old, this melancholy reverie is a heartfelt expression of nostalgia for the Edwardian London music-halls of his youth, rich with deeply personal sentiment and warmly realized autobiographical fantasy.",
            "Chaplin at his most melancholy. Not his best work, but the short time he and Keaton are on stage together is priceless."

            "There are moments of lyrical beauty and Porterfield never patronises his subjects, but a sense of tranquilised resignation dominates.",

            "The fatal misstep, I think, is his decision to ask the characters questions from off camera, documentary style, so characters look directly into the camera to answer.",

            "With \"Putty Hill,\" Porterfield joins the company of American indie directors Ramin Bahrani and Kelly Reichardt, filmmakers often compelled to seek out everyday souls in their textured, oh-so quotidian environs.",
            "It looks closely, burrows deep, considers the way in which lives have become pointless and death therefore less meaningful.",
            "\"Putty Hill\" transcends the usual docudrama hybrid to occupy a thrilling third place, dreamlike and scruffy, opaque and pellucid.",
            "A creative and risky blend of a character-driven drama and a documentary about some alienated working-class people in a slummy suburb of Baltimore.",
            "Matt Porterfield's moody, elliptical fusion of fiction and documentary, slips back and forth between the forms with a stealth that dissolves one into the other."

            "Into Eternity is a documentary that may look like a science fiction movie, but it ends up more of a horror film.",
            "Madsen, whose symmetrical compositions and slo-mo shots of uniformed workers have a quality of Kubrickian sci-fi, frames the film as a message to the future.",
            "In a deceptively low-key manner, Danish filmmaker Michael Madsen has beautifully crafted one of the most provocative movies of the year.",
            "Directed by Danish filmmaker Michael Madsen with grace and deep curiosity, \"Into Eternity\" is better than timely.",
            "Watching the film is akin to having a totally immersive, video game-like experience, a journey best described as Lord of the Rings meets 2001: A Space Odyssey.",
            "Into Eternity provides few solutions regarding the estimated 200,000 to 300,000 tons of N-waste lying around the world, but it does alert us to potentially devastating consequences. Will we heed the warning?",
            "Madsen's ominous work is reminiscent, stylistically, of Kubrick's masterworks 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and The Shining (1980) in its visual precision and chilly environs.",
            "Into Eternity may be the most honest, as well as the most beautiful, documentary you've ever seen.",

            "Part instructional video, part existential head-trip",
            "Transcending agitprop, this disturbing documentary gets to the heart of the question of civilization and its discontents.",
            "More like a troubling dream, or outtakes from an abandoned David Lynch project, than a conventional documentary.",
            "While nothing said in his film undercuts this worry, the way the movie and the people in it express their concern gives it a feeling of sublimity unusual in most environmentalist documentaries.",
            "Approaches the Onkalo problem with one part curiosity to two parts dubiousness, reflected in a hyper-aestheticized style that feels equally influenced by Errol Morris, Sigur R\u00f3s, and creepy science-fiction movies.",
            "The story of a nuclear-waste repository designed to last 100,000 years becomes a haunting rumination on time, language, civilization and folly.",
            "Defamiliarizing the snowy Nordic landscape, this delicately lurid documentary has a somber beauty. It is meant to boggle the mind and inspire awe-and it does.",
            "The film reaches way beyond the usual activist crowd by making itself as formally compelling as it is tightly argued.",
            "As a film, it's extremely mannered. And truly sobering.",
            "Formally exacting and sonically immersive, Madsen's approach is so hypnotic you emerge as if roused from a troubling dream.",
            "My only quarrel is that it is perhaps too short, and could have done with more wide-ranging interviews to tackle its implications.",
            "Extract the core issue and Into Eternity becomes endlessly fascinating.",
            "A riveting documentary: as spooky as the early scenes of 2001 in its glacial camera-prowlings around \"Onkalo\", a deep-mined waste bin for nuclear garbage and the probable future of disposal for our planet.",
            "The moral and scientific implications of the project are deftly sketched and engaging."

            "while Bereavement is certainly a slasher, it is also a film about how monsters are made, in which every character, hero and villain alike, is figured as tragic prey to genes and circumstance.",
            "Effective atmospherics don't rescue this formulaic slasher flick.",
            "I'd sooner touch a nine-volt battery to my tongue than sit through this film again.",
            "Bereavement -- miraculously as dull as its title -- is neither far gone enough to be funny nor well thought-out enough to be disturbing.",
            "Virtually every shot in Bereavement -- a sort of prequel to Mena's Malevolence (2005) -- is the right one; the editing, also by Mena, is first-rate.",
            "The film is so laughably Freudian it could play as a parody of certain acclaimed horror film studies such as Men, Women and Chainsaws: Gender in the Horror Film. ",
            "Evidence of a group of filmmakers who take their horror seriously.",
            "Palinesque, bland and increasingly silly with oodles of unintentional humor instead of what every horror fan expects: palpable scares. ",
            "Gruesome in the moment, but your memory of it is easily wiped clean.",
            "\"Bereavement\" is cruel and unusual.",
            "\"Bereavement\" isn't a bad slasher film, but after a few stabs (no pun intended) at being something more, it settles for being just a slasher film. And that's disappointing.",
            "In this deliberately paced horror movie, a big-city teen homes in on the darkness at the edge of a small Pennsylvania town, with grim results.",
            "It truly plays like one person's nightmarish descent into a world of total madness. It gives you a feel for who Martin Bristol is and why he's so lethal. On that level the film is a complete success. ",
            "Bereavement is one nasty piece of work.",
            "It's difficult to care about people who are all stupid to a fault.",
            "A character-centric thriller signifying Mena's progression as a filmmaker even as it doesn't quite retain the same home-grown charm and earnestness of its predecessor.",
            "Though Mena refers to his sadistically sliced up female brisket as therapeutic, there's a line between calming viewer fears, and titillating them. While human chopped meat served up raw making you go vegetarian, isn't exactly relished food for thought.",
            "Incredible improvement from Malevolence in terms of camerawork, score and performances. Bereavement paints a horrifyingly vivid picture of the mind of a psychopathic killer."

            "Frankly, it seems like the story took a backseat in favour of the visuals, coming across as a loosely related series of song and dance numbers that work better separately than in the context of the film.",

            "This dark, well-acted suburban tale is follow-up to the gifted Mendleson's most promising feature debut",
            "And although Mendelsohn maintains a certain cool detachment, he also allows the film to occasionally soar in unexpected ways.",
            "Mendelsohn may believe he's presenting an unvarnished look at middle-class America, but if these kinds of people exist, you won't recognize them.",
            "Unlike those indie directors whose feel-good, P.C. claptrap predictably gets praised by the very people it flatters, Mendelsohn makes suburban poetry that opposes the way middle-class film culture likes to fantasize itself.",
            "It may not be the Long Island the natives are more accustomed to, but that sense of place from a prism of both wonderment and despair, is deep into the moment of those physical and human worlds alike, playing out sensually and emotionally in suburbia.",
            "Three lives intersect over the course of a fall day in Long Island in Eric Mendelsohn's dazzling and delicate independent drama 3 Backyards.",

            "Making the Boys is fascinating recent history and a fascinating personal story as well.",
            "The hopelessly dated 1968 play \"The Boys in the Band\" yields a surprisingly sprightly and multifaceted documentary, \"Making the Boys.\"",
            "An entertaining and compelling reason to either reconsider the polarizing work or to experience it for the first time with due regard for its original context.",
            "A fine new documentary about the evolution of the controversial play and subsequent movie.",
            "For all the attention paid to the issues surrounding Boys, however, but for a handful of too-short clips, there's surprisingly little detail about the specifics of the film or play",
            "It is hard to make a lively documentary out of talking heads, but Robey has done that as he puts the play into historical perspective.",
            "Scrupulously researched, highly absorbing and worthwhile documentary about, like it or not, the seminal gay play.",
            "A comprehensive look at the creation and afterlife of a significant work of art.",
            "In a way, Making's director, Crayton Robey, has written a love letter to [Natalie] Wood",
            "A fascinating slice of contemporary history, one that too easily could be overlooked or forgotten. Entertaining and enlightening.",

            "Better than its premise would suggest, the film works to the degree that it does thanks to the well-drawn characterizations and the frequent doses of sly, subtle humor.",
            "Cattrall does what she does best, pushing boundaries unapologetically. And there's not a hint of lewd intentions, but plenty of saucy satire surrounding US culture's sexual contradictions, in a geek's determined fantasy romance bypassing cougar labels. ",
            "From a plot standpoint, there isn't much that's remarkable about it, yet its two central figures are so honestly drawn that they make up for any predictability along the way.",
            "Blessed with a promising concept for a dark comedy, \"Meet Monica Velour\" would rather tug heartstrings or script repetitive behavior from derivative characters. ",

            "A low-key indie of determined charm. Kim Cattrall's brave and affecting performance as an over-the-hill '80s porn star is reason enough to see it.",
            "Cattrall embraces her 49-year-old character with open arms and gives a fine performance full of strength, vulnerability and also sexual chemistry.",

            "The nicest thing to be said about Cat Run might be that it doesn't know what kind of movie it wants to become.",
            "If you can't dazzle 'em with brilliance, baffle 'em with genre baloney -- and enough shoplifted visual trickery to fill Quentin Tarantino's kitchen sink.",
            "Though John Stockwell's action comedy is shamelessly derivative, his enthusiastic cast propels it much further than it should go.",
            "An incoherent hybrid of buddy movie, \"Girls Gone Wild\" episode and James Bond spoof that employs cheap cinematic tricks like multiple split screens for no apparent purpose.",
            "Words like \"smug,\" \"derivative,\" and \"shallow\" could all be fairly applied to the film, but as a piece of late-night exploitation, it delivers the violence and nudity with the regularity of an IV drip, and some familiar faces in the cast help class it up.",
            "Run, don't walk, to Cat Run.",
            "This movie is fiercely uneven, feeling like two different movies got drunk and had a sloppy love child that now no one wants.",
            "A loud, ugly and terrible movie that doesn't skillfully juggle its various elements; it throws them violently at your face and calls it edge.",

            "Bullets, babes, perverts, Euro travel, secret documents, hitmen, car bombs, and testicular torture. Oh my.",
            "Made for today it just is more chaotic, has more nudity, and had more violence including some slightly nauseating scenes of torture. Otherwise the film is funny and fun, a fast, entertaining ride.",
            "A brazenly efficient and articulate female assassin nearly worthy of a Tarantino or Coen Brothers movie sticks out from amidst the schlocky criminal muck of Cat Run, a self-consciously sleazy comic crime saga composed of facetious elements.",
            "A third-generation Tarantino rip-off distinguished only by its equal-opportunity nudity.",
            "Director John Stockwell uses split screens, a blaxploitation soundtrack, and hammy, Get Smart sound effects to put some old-school spring in Cat Run's step. It makes for an odd combination with the film's ecstatic, viscera-laden violence. "

            "Most viewers should find the documentary Battle For Brooklyn gripping and provocative, no matter their opinions about eminent domain, historic preservation, or public dollars going to support private development.",
            "Nothing propels a documentary like injustice, and Michael Galinsky and Suki Hawley's infuriating chronicle of an outer-borough David-versus-Goliath saga plays like a marathon of inequity.",
            "Battle for Brooklyn provides a useful primer on the opposition to Atlantic Yards, but figures who might have made more compelling documentary subjects than the always on-message Goldstein crowd the sidelines.",
            "Although Battle for Brooklyn gives voice to the project's supporters, there's little doubt which side Galinsky and Hawley are on."

            "A winning example of modesty in front of the camera and intelligence behind it.",
            "The fact that Tariq Tapa's Zero Bridge has been forged on such bare, simple terms makes it hard to quibble with the film's more glaring faults",
            "An amazing first film by a 29 year old director/screenwriter/cameraman on location in war-torn Kashmir. Not explicitly a radical film, it has references to this beautiful country's war-related suffering in almost every frame.",
            "The gritty tale, crafted in the social realist tradition, is a raw metaphor touching on the psychology of mass misery in that Indian occupied police state, where even the movie theaters are now expropriated military headquarters.",
            "This excellent debut film provides an insider's view of life in Kashmir."

            "An agreeably sick little movie about a serial killer, a bunch of cats and the uneasy tenants of a Montreal apartment complex.",
            "The tone of the film is off-key from the beginning, a fact that's not helped by the presence of Speedman, onetime Felicity heartthrob.",
            "Good Neighbors is a darkly comedic thriller with echoes of Shallow Grave and an undercurrent of repressed Canadian rage, and though it comes to an anticlimactic end, it manages a lot with a slow build of unease.",
            "This film has one of the best murder scenes in recent film memory. It's brutal and hilarious at the same time - and a must-see for cat lovers.",
            "The film is superbly crafted, with veteran cinematographer Guy Dufaux composing a coherent palette of dark, rich interiors.",
            "Not a crackerjack thriller by any means, and I'm not sure it means to be: It's a dark comedy about people who do horrible things.",
            "Good Neighbors ends up being a rather unremarkable dramatic thriller that squanders any potential for greatness it had with a bland and uninspired finale.",
            "A sneakily absorbing indie thriller.",
            "Thankfully Tierney saves the film from becoming a prosaic whodunit by casually revealing the murder's identity 40 minutes in, forcing Good Neighbors to succeed as all films should, through character and style.",
            "Inspired pitch-black humor and a crackerjack ensemble.",
            "For sheer, absurd gruesomeness, one stomach-turning scene in this obnoxious, uninvolving Canadian thriller could win 2011's prize. ",
            "desperately in need of a more refined directorial palette",
            "Good Neighbors is a hotbed of twisted ideas with a straightforward yet novel approach to the Gothic horror in the hearts of mistakenly everyday people.",
            "It's blackhearted fun, but eventually the spurt runs dry, and all that's left is a pallid corpse.",
            "Writer/director Jacob Tierney is spun dizzy by the complex narrative of deceptions and confessions, laboring over moody particulars while the tension gradually dries up. ",
            "Perhaps 'The Trotsky' drained Tierney and Baruchel of all their pep and passion because this follow-up collaboration is quite the opposite, dull and lifeless.",
            "Tierney offers what preparations he can for the offbeat darkness to come, but at least one part of the perfect, triple-crossing crime that plays out is so black you may want to wear shades. ",
            "A solid, respectable genre piece that should play extra well when watched late one night in your own one or two-bedroom high-rise dwelling.",
            "'Good Neighbors' borders on a beneficial near amateurishness as it picks up headway to finish with a rare satisfactory twist and undeclared future. ",
            "An effective noirish drama of three neighbors with hidden, violent flaws",
            "It's a skillful enough psychological exercise -- on the usual paltry Canadian budget -- to suggest Tierney is an unsung homegrown talent, more than ready to move up to bigger budgets and bigger toys."

            "Kung Fu Panda 2 gets a little darker and slushier than the first, but never loses sight of its objective: fun, fun, fun. The animation is outstanding, and the story has enough surprises to make it new.",
            "Where, in short, is this film's personality, or even the characters' personalities, for that matter?",
            "[A] satisfying, if less than sensational, sequel to the funny, charming and action-packed animated feature from 2008.",
            "The massive amount of artistry that has gone into the cinematography, lighting and design makes this as sumptuous and pleasing a film to behold as Tangled.",
            "The central notion of discovering one's unique personal identity (\"the only thing that matters is what you choose to be now\") takes us back to an earlier China and it's free of jokey references to other movies.",
            "It drops points for a narrative that overstretches by at least 20 minutes.",
            "Capitalizes on the same techniques that made its predecessor successful.",
            "The film becomes one of DreamWorks Animation's most satisfying animated features yet.",
            "Do the world a favor and skip this movie; maybe it'll force the creative team to put in actual effort into something besides the fight scenes (which, I might add, were short on martial arts) on number 3.",
            "Beautifully storyboarded, each frame looks like an illustration from a well-written children's book. The Hans Zimmer musical score is fantastic.",

            "It presents an amazing prologue animated in the manner of the typical Chinese puppet theaters. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "Kung Fu Panda 2 feels refreshing.",
            "This movie offers further proof that the immersive medium of 3D is ill-suited for the genre that's been most compelled to adopt it: hectic, fast-moving action. Bring on the inner peace.",
            "This is rare territory for a children's movie, and it shows a surprising depth and maturity. It may take a few shortcuts here and there, but it packs a disarming emotional wallop.",
            "It's a zippy 90-minute affair that is effective and entertaining. But look deeper and there is more, a richly detailed movie with a surprisingly sweet and emotional story at its core.",
            "This is exactly the kind of film that's needed sometimes, it's fun, exciting, vivid and memorable. Oh, and kids will like it too I guess...",
            "Po the Panda smoothly flows from lovable loser to supercool warrior on a mission in the entertaining animated adventure \"Kung Fu Panda 2.\"",
            "An endearing story of brotherly love, acceptance and friendship that will attract young and old alike. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "[Director Jennifer Yuh] manages the balance nicely; Po is alternately awesome and dumbstruck, and it can be fun to guess at the start of each scene which attribute will come to the fore. Often it's a combination on the two.",
            "Kung Fu Panda 2 achieves something few sequels to blockbusters ever do -- it stays true to a successful formula without seeming tired, cynical, or lazy.",
            "Kung Fu Panda 2 benefits from an entertaining story, fantastic direction and amazing visuals. It's one of 2011's best animated films.",
            "[\"Kung Fu Panda 2\" has] got everything you could want in a film made for kids including a good story, stunning animation, and a few laughs.",
            "I guess my expectations may have been too high. I didn't want a silly KUNG FU PANDA 2, loaded with jokes. I was hoping it would be more like the first one. "

            "Paul isn't as riotous as the early Pegg and Frost movies, but it does have a certain sweetness. Everyone in it is sort of innocent, except Paul, the alien wisecracker. It's likeable, if uneven, rather than hilarious.",
            "It is a sunny road trip comedy that had me smiling from the start, and while there are the occasional hiccups this is still as breezily a good time at the movies as I've had this year.",
            "Paul is offensive solely for being so underachieving.",
            "Well, that's one joke. Ninety more minutes to go.",
            "The film has some laughs. But it also has a million jokes about anal probes, alien genitalia, and people thinking Clive and Graeme are gay. These guys can do better than this.",

            "A solid piece of work with many hilarious moments, the ensemble cast work perfectly together and the references never miss their mark.",
            "It's geek pride all the way. It's funny, it's exciting, and it has jokes about spaceman junk. Who could ask for anything more?",
            "Again, Paul is a very good film, and could certainly be enjoyed by a large audience; but like Chinese food, it will likely be forgotten not long after consumption. ",
            "The jokes, while solid, didn't feel focused enough. Paul is a nerd love letter when it could have been a monument.",

            "It's raunchy but harmless",
            "This is a nerd movie made by n00bs.",
            "A sort of comedy homage to seminal sci-fi movie culture from the 80s, Paul never takes itself too seriously and is a lot of fun.",
            "Passable f-bomb riddled fanboy fare, a bit of a comedown from Frost and Pegg's British movies. ",
            "Paul is probably the closest thing to Spaced that Pegg and Frost have made since Edgar Wright closed the book on Tim & Daisy.",
            "It's not a bad film by any means, it was just slightly disappointing especially when you take into account the talents of Pegg and Frost.",
            "Surprisingly smart and filled with homage, Paul is crass and a little rough around the edges, but thoroughly enjoyable."

            "Scream's brand of horror, which lampooned the slasher genre while simultaneously embracing it, was fun and breezy in 1996. In 2011, it's about as fresh as the whiff of something stale and rank from a crypt.",

            "Some fussy directorial touches don't seriously get in the way of a tricky plot with a suspenseful denouement and there's an excellent use of locations in the Los Angeles area.",

            "We don't ask much of our legal thrillers beyond a twisty plot and a good villain to watch go down, and Brad Furman's methodical thriller doesn't bother offering much more than that. ",

            "Entertaining, holds your attention, a great performance by McConaughey. Very refreshing as his past rom/com, leading-man roles have been just so-so. ",
            "The verdict is in. 12-0 in favor of The Lincoln Lawyer.",
            "The Lincoln Lawyer doesn't get as down and dirty and thoughtful as its source material, but it is consistently entertaining and engaging, knowing how to make us worry, then cheer. Overall, it's a courtroom victory. ",

            "The film perhaps stays most true to its namesake when I realize I have already forgotten much of it just days after seeing it.",
            "The first Hangover was hysterical: a superb compendium of all the worst nights we've ever had while still - by the skin of our teeth - being believable. This manages both to go right over the top, but also not add up to a hill of vomit.",
            "The Wolfpack have earned this final bow.",

            "[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy] is a welcome throwback to old-time espionage stories.",
            "There are many good reasons why movies cannot run on for six hours, so when cinematic necessity compels squeezing a fine six-hour show like Tinker, Tailor into one third the time, audience and story are likely to be shortchanged, as happens here.",

            "It has disdain for the process, showing the inherent hypocrisy living inside the political system and the corruptive influence it can have on the lives and mores of seeming innocents caught up within its withering whirlpools of self-aggrandizement. ",
            "A marvellously stable thriller that squeezes you so expertly you react in all the ways it wants.",
            "You could set your watch by The Ides of March, George Clooney's sleek potboiler about soured idealism, spin and dirty secrets.",
            "A dark drama that gleams with pure quality.",
            "Superbly adapted, perfectly acted, deviously brilliant drama that carefully examines its gathering of corrupt political minions.",
            "The most challenging aspect of watching The Ides of March may very well be that it all feels too frighteningly real.",
            "There are a lot of conventionally-shot people talking in rooms - the most ambitious image lies on the poster. ",
            "It is a truly intriguing political drama that impresses us from start to finish. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Some of the best political writing since Gore Vidal's Kennedy clan-inspired The Best Man, another witty \"liberal\" knife-fight.",
            "This film is great on many levels, from entertainment to technical. Clooney has made with The Ides of March the post honeymoon period of the Obama era film.",
            "Altogether, Ides of March is a very neat package. Eye candy aside, smart yourself up in this feature.",
            "It is suspenseful, engaging and interesting, if not exactly a pleasure to watch.",
            "A smart, engaging October drama that feels completely of the moment, as if its fingers are directly on the pulse of our political climate. ",
            "This is a fascinating look at politics, with Clooney making the most out of a strong, and very talented, cast... I just wish Clooney could have found another way to get to his desired destination. ",
            "Still, The Ides of March is very entertaining. Fans of the actors and fans of thoughtful, lively movies alike should be well-pleased. ",
            "The story is a brilliant human chess game.",
            "[The Ides of March] is very playlike: It's based on the stage show Farragut North by Beau Willimon. But that feeling doesn't harm the film, as Clooney stages all the confrontations -- the movie is full of them -- with a deft hand.",
            "The Ides of March may not cover any new ground in its exploration of the shadier side of American politics, but it's nevertheless an enjoyable journey down the campaign trail.",
            "Surprisingly effective for such a by-the-numbers political drama.",
            "A topical, intelligent and compelling affair.",
            "If only the film had been 90 minutes of Giamatti and Hoffman instead of Gosling and Clooney, then this could have been an excellent political drama.",
            "For my money, The Ides Of March -- with its dark view of human nature and satisfyingly twisty plot -- is one of the most entertaining films ever made about the political process."

            "It may not be a film that has any lasting impact, but it is one that satisfies audiences trying to get their action fix.",
            "The Mechanic isn't precisely a classic, but Foster's performance and the ferocity of some sequences elevate it above the genre median. ",
            "If you've seen and enjoyed a Statham movie, you know what to expect.",
            "Statham belongs to the tradition of heroes, from John Wayne through Harrison Ford, who are laconic to the point of grumpiness. Yet it's not his terse toughness that makes him special. Oddly enough it's his fastidiousness...",

            "Somewhat faithful to the original, but a stupendously violent fiasco that weasels its way into being unlikable. ",
            "[Simon West] goes for headshots, stabbings and other dispatches that are the antithesis of modern PG-13 action filmmaking.",
            "If you're looking for substance, character development, and an engaging storyline, you'll sadly be disappointed as this film is seriously lacking in all three of those areas.",

            "The Mechanic will be a decent time-killer for Statham fans, but it's another black mark against the name of director Simon West. ",
            "... a minor pleasure to see an action film that makes a virtue of lean, mean action stripped to the essence. ",
            "A passable, but emotionally empty, action film that fails to capitalize on its interesting characters.",
            "Jason Statham is quickly becoming the 21st century's Bruce Willis -- I am convinced that when the apocalypse comes, the only things left surviving on the planet will be cockroaches and this Derbyshire-born bloke."

            "The thing with Joe Wright's beautifully shot movie is that it never really feels true. ",
            "Hanna is not just a sleek action movie (with a heart-pounding soundtrack), but it also has a soul that you don't want to part with.",
            "This cool, calculated who's-hunting-who piece brings home all the requisite tension, gunplay and fighting with a great deal of cinematic style.",
            "Wright is capable of much better, as is everyone in the cast. He's trying to make a silky Euro thriller with a frisson of controversy. It's more like a never-ending trailer.",
            "Folklore undercurrents that prove initially spry and intriguing are soon rendered ... leadenly obvious.",
            "The body count is phenomenal and the overall effect polished, weightless and unmemorable.",
            "Tries so hard to be edgy and different that desperation trumps the minor intrigue brought about by bizarre characters and situations.",
            "Never quite gels into a cohesive cinematic experience and is, far too often, simply boring. ",
            "We walk out of it with more questions than anything else, which can sometimes be a film's strength ... but that's not the case here.",
            "Ostensibly a thriller about a teenage assassin, Hanna reveals itself to be a fairytale with a modern twist.",
            "A unique, often strange take on both an action film and a growing-up story",
            "Explosive, intense, heart pounding, riveting, pulsating...and these are just a few of the adjectives to describe Hanna.",
            "It's one hell of a letdown.",
            "A sleek, willfully preposterous action movie...This is a rare action movie where women rule.",
            "The deeper the story gets, the more convoluted and preposterous it becomes. Still, \"Hanna\" is a lot of fun, thanks to Ronan and two great action sequences.",
            "Overall, Saoirse Ronan is a marvelous, powerful actress and Hanna is a great character. Perhaps a sequel to the film Hanna will have a script worthier of both. ",
            "Hanna is a pulse-pounding, lethal fairy-tale actioner.",
            "The soundtrack by the Chemical Brothers is outstanding. It makes the film look rather like a series of music videos, but so well shot and energetic, the viewer doesn't really mind.",
            "A dark, twisted fairy tale. 'I just missed your heart,' Hanna says to an elk she shoots at the beginning of the film. The film itself, however, is almost right on target.",
            "A perfect package of pulsating chills and pulpy thrills.",
            "Beautifully shot sequences and little character moments kept me leaning forward in excitement.",
            "When a storyline is this flat, the characters need to be all the more engaging and Hanna fails in this regard.",
            "Hanna wouldn't have been convincing with any other star in the title role.",
            "Yes, this is a well-made, well-acted, entertaining movie. But it left me curiously empty afterward."

            "Colombiana has one true asset -- the seminude sight of its star, Zoe Saldana -- and milks it for everything it's worth.",
            "Half the dialogue between these dirtbags is devoted to her near-invisibility, and all of it's awful: \"She's like mist,\" apparently.",
            "Even the talented Saldana can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear - much less a dog's dinner.",
            "Occasionally enjoyable in a silly way, but I have to say Besson's preoccupation with the little-girl-becomes-killer trope is looking a little unwholesome.",
            "Colombiana wants to be Bourne with boobs, but its connect-the-dots narrative and silted script means it can't quite reach those bone-crunching heights.",
            " never achieves the intellectual and emotional depth to which it at times seems to aspire.",

            "Zoe Saldana's charisma not withstanding, Colombiana is the female equivalent of a Jason Statham film, i.e. badass but bland.",
            "[Zoe Soldana's] cheekbones may take our breath away, but so do her martial arts chops.",
            "Given the acrobatic fight skills Zoe Saldana displayed in Avatar, and since producer Luc Besson's stock-in-trade is the female assassin film, 'Colombiana' was a match made in She-Terminator heaven.",
            "A guilty pleasure film that is more fun than it deserves to be.",
            "You keep wanting \"Colombiana\" to go all the way in one direction, or all the way in the other. Instead, it just sits there, content to give Saldana a lollypop.",
            "Colombiana contains some thrilling scenes as well as an interesting sense of twisted humor, but there's not enough here to really keep us engaged.",
            "Laugh out loud exploitation...See Zoe shoot. See Zoe kill. See Zoe strip (PG-13 style)",
            "Colombiana is caught somewhere in the middle of an engaging character drama and a brainless action extravaganza.",
            "With a tighter story and structure, most of the film's problems could have been easily fixed, resulting in a film that doesn't feel like a build-up of superfluous events.",
            "Ranks as one of the more eco- and econ-friendly projects of recent memory, what with producer/co-writer Luc Besson recycling many elements from his prior successes.",
            "The action set pieces are elaborately staged and sometimes exciting, but the dull script, overcooked direction and wonky editing damage this otherwise enjoyable B-movie.",
            "\"Colombiana\" never even considers that what Cataleya has devoted her life to doing might not be entirely justified and that what she does might make her just as evil as the people who wronged her.",
            "A fast-paced tale of revenge, 'Colombiana' is a better-than-average actioner made all the more interesting by its female lead. Zoe Saldana ('Star Trek' and 'Avatar') follows the path of 'Hanna' and 'Salt' as a tough-as-nails assassin. "
