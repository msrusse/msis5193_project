            "Everything in Phantom Menace exists in a bright noisy vacuum.",
            "The movie is fun, for the most part, and several scenes are as good or better than anything Lucas created in the original films. The human characters, however, are not nearly as interesting as those in the earlier episodes.",

            "An amazingly disappointing film experience.",
            "Despite the repetitiveness and subpar feeling existing in just about every aspect, there's still fun to be had with the lightsaber dueling and space battles.",
            "It just goes on and on, without generating suspense or building excitement.",
            "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace gives us a great set up for what is to come in the future with Anakin & Palpatine. And for that, I am thankful. The rest is not great.",
            "The Phantom Menace instead is a bold announcement that the new films will do their best to try something new every time. They won't always succeed, but even in failure there is glory.",
            "Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace gets the saga off to a bit of a rough start.",
            "One of George Lucas' creative high points - an excellent look at the failings of a society on the brink. The original subversive Star Wars entry.",
            "It lacks alarmingly a very high percentage of the MAGIC that its predecessors had. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "Despite all the exposition it can also feel very confusing of who is doing what and why.",
            "I really don't want to be one of those Episode I haters, it does have SOME merit, but man, it just grates on you how annoying it is for the majority of its runtime...",
            "It had almost impossibly high expectations tagged on to it and unfortunately did not scale the heights it was hoped/expected it would. This could've been so much more.",
            "The pod-racing sequence halfway through is exhilarating... The rest of it just about hangs together with some truly dreadful dialogue. ",
            "From the point of view of the series as a whole, the new movie is pure backstory. And in spite of all the zipping and zapping, its own plot barely advances an inch.",
            "Exceptional fight choreography coupled with one of the best songs in Star Wars' history certainly isn't enough to save [it], but next time someone makes the ill-advised choice to check it out, you at least have [a] great sequence to look forward to.",
            "From the ridiculous title, with those two M's gummily stuck together in the middle, to the uniformly atrocious performances, from the incomprehensible plot to the sluggish pacing, The Phantom Menace is an unsalvageable disaster.",
            "... \"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace\" is the weakest movie in the series, but that does not mean it's an absolute disaster. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "As a standalone film, The Phantom Menace probably won't appeal to kids raised on rapid editing and epic explosions, nor does it work as an introduction to the Star Wars universe.",
            "It is not remotely devoid of value. It's just that none of this value comes from plot, character, or capacity to provide entertainment."

            "Whatever you think of Spike Lee, when he has the faith in his talent and material and is able to be political without the dogma, he's one of the best filmmakers to come out of America in the 1980's.",
            "Lee does capture the terror a serial killer can wreak upon the community, but his concentration on the weak characters hurts in the long run.",

            "Of course, it's immaculately crafted and exhilaratingly paced, but in the end it's never as emotionally involving as it could and should be.",

            "It's an older, wiser Scorsese and Schrader back together 23 years after 'Taxi Driver' telling the story of another insomniac basket case driving around New York City late at night. Except now instead of an avenging angel he's on a mission of mercy.",
            "There is no denying Scorsese is one of American cinema's most astonishing directors, but I honestly think it is high time Bringing Out the Dead was revisited and given another chance.",

            "Martin Scorsese is a wonderful filmmaker. And he loves New York. He is at his best, though, when he has an interesting story to tell.",

            "It's assuredly the work of a master filmmaker.",

            "The treatment of this touchy material is impressive, neither gratuitous nor mincing, but this 1999 satirical comedy doesn't really go anywhere.",
            "An instant classic, Alexander Payne's 1999 high school comedy seems even more scathing now that we're losing control of our own election machinery.",
            "Election at first has the feel of a simple work. But don't let that fool you; it's a complex, deep tale.",
            "You've got to laugh at Witherspoon's tightly wound Little Miss Perfect, rising at dawn to do her hair and encase herself in a preppy look before baking cupcakes to pass out at school as vote-getters in her campaign for student council president.",
            "The young Reese Witherspoon leads with her determined chin as single-minded go-getter Tracy Flick...",
            "A remnant from the provocative period of Alexander Payne, Election is as deviously potent now as it was at the time of its release.",
            "Suffers from a tyrannical sameness of tone where Payne doesn't trust his audience to 'get' the crashing subtext, so he batters them over the head with it for nearly two hours",
            "Alexander Payne's Election remains one of the best political satire comedies of all time.",
            "An annihilating satire of the American experience, Election has never really been equaled for sheer truth-telling about the crushing awfulness of high school, which sets us up for the rotten lives we're going to live thereafter.",
            "The lack of emotion and seriousness with which some of his characters behave is surprisingly amusing. It's like Wes Anderson without the twee set designs and world-building.",
            "Alexander Payne's wicked satire of power and (social) politics set in the overheated incubator of a high school student body election is as sharp and perceptive now as it was in 1999.",
            "Payne and Taylor are equal opportunity satirists and their sly wit dismantles everything from high school culture to suburban complacency.",
            "This clever, biting high-school satire is arguably Alexander Payne's most original and accomplished film (and so far he has made only good pictures).",
            "Dark high school comedy is best for older teens.",
            "Surprise! An intelligent, well-written high school story that offers some real ideas to chew on, rather than simply wallowing in nubile flesh.",
            "Took the sleaze of the teen comedy and spun it into something that's both hugely entertaining and extremely insightful.",
            "A funny and horrifying allegory of American politics and adult society, as seen through the prism--or shall we say \"prison\"?--that is secondary education. [Blu-ray]",
            "Maybe its only real fault is that it's a little too close to the truth to be as funny as it could be.",

            "The script, based on a Tom Perrotta novel, is tight and elegant.",

            "It's a lazy, thoroughly old- fashioned entertainment... Yet it's also unexpectedly watchable and unpretentious -- campy, too, if you're into that kind of thing -- and it communicates a sense that everyone involved had a super time making it.",
            "A collection of isolated, anecdotal events that are as warmly amusing as they are lacking in narrative drive.",
            "The banter, jealousy and cattiness among these charming stereotypes of the Anglo-American lifestyle sweepstakes makes much of this engaging film a winner.",
            "Art and suffocating tastefulness are taken as such inherent goods in [this film] that they utterly overwhelm the real people whom the film pretends to showcase.",

            "The film's resolute failure is clearly a group effort requiring not just an awful script and flat-footed direction, but also terrible acting, an intrusive and derivative score, and a plot that seems to have been lifted from an unproduced Baretta teleplay.",

            "It's a terrible movie, really, but I'm not hard-hearted enough to condemn it, because it brings back some of the scrappy feel of '70s TV action series.",
            "If only the filmmakers had paid as much attention to plot as they did to the soundtrack, The Mod Squad might have had a reason for existence (other than raking in profits from gullible opening-weekend audiences).",

            "Mindless, stylish fun.",
            "Who cares?",
            "Otherwise dependable young actors like Danes, Ribisi and Epps seem lost in one-dimensional and unconvincing characters.",

            "The story lacks focused character conflict that would make it a truly fine cinematic experience.",

            "It's actually the fourth entry in the series, after a couple of straight-to-cable sequels. That's a lot of pulp to squeeze out of a concept that was fairly juiceless to begin with.",

            "A revelation in storytelling, cinematography, and marketing. ",

            "Directors Sanchez and Myrick understand the lure of legend and storytelling to the horror genre, and they cleverly choose to wrap the film up in various Russian Doll layers.",
            "There was a considerable number of people who went to go see The Blair Witch Project believing it was a documentary. That's how uncommercialized found footage was as a conceit, and how elegantly crafted this movie is.",
            "Easily the scariest horror picture of the '90s, a movie that can take a place among the most potent and inexorable of modern shockers, like Night of the Living Dead or The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.",
            "It is a triumph of intelligence over special effects, guerrilla filmmaking over Hollywood spectacle.",
            "Feel free to admire it: As a cheeky, clever stunt, it deserves it. Enjoying it fully might be a bit more difficult.",
            "The abrupt, unforgiving way the film ends is still shocking despite all the film's imitators, and it's a strong finish to a film that spends a little too much time wandering.",
            "No doubt part of the reason that the film has affected some viewers so intensely is because it requires them to fill in a lot of blank spaces, to exercise a perceptive muscle which, especially among younger viewers, may have grown flabby from neglect.",
            "Scary without being explicit, it's a 1990s cinematic landmark, and best judged away from the hype.",
            "Don't go see The Blair Witch Project alone; it's too scary to sit through without company. Thrillingly, nauseatingly so.",
            "It's like watching actors rehearse Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf in the forest.",
            "Its shaky camera work and fuzzy images get monotonous after a while, and there's not much room for character development within the very limited plot."

            "The notion of art as an organically evolving process is crucial to Leigh. Almost alone among directors, he creates his scripts in the rehearsal period through improvisations. ",
            "[A] beautifully crafted and lively romp around the 1880s stage world.",
            "Leigh's cast are beyond compare, and the whole bighearted, splendidly droll celebration of the entertainer's lot surely stands among British cinema's one-of-a-kind treasures.",
            "If you are a Gilbert and Sullivan buff, you will be in heaven. If you are not, the first thing you will need to know is that the film is nearly three hours long.",
            "The film is a delight and a surprise, all the more so since Leigh is associated with gritty working-class stories.",
            "Not your normal period piece, to be sure.",
            "The film runs out of momentum about two-thirds of the way through, but by then its exquisitely wrought human and historical detail- and its lavish servings of fine singing- have cast a lingering spell.",
            "Leigh's strict attention to detail and his uncommon method of involving his actors in the creative process of forming the script infuses life into material that could have easily become another stiff, British period production",
            "The sense of a work of art coming to life has rarely been more beautifully or excitingly portrayed. This is a film not to be missed.",
            "A great study on the struggle to create live theater, containing beautiful musical sequences and fantastic portrayals of the musical's creators.",
            "There is not an unrealized or extraneous character in the film, and I can't remember a movie that so completely studies the intricacies of bringing a production to the stage.",
            "The real magic of this film is in the way most of the characters skillfully navigate their way around each other's sizable but fragile egos.",
            "Leigh has handcrafted a big production and succeeds, mostly, in entertaining the viewer to the end -- especially for fans of Gilbert and Sullivan.",
            "... an enlightening exploration of how artists must sometimes journey into unknown territory before they find inspiration enough to keep from repeating themselves.",
            "Criado, em boa parte, atrav\u00e9s de improvisa\u00e7\u00e3o (tradi\u00e7\u00e3o de Leigh), o filme tem v\u00e1rias subtramas que jamais se resolvem - mas \u00e9 interessante, especialmente ao mostrar os bastidores de um espet\u00e1culo em produ\u00e7\u00e3o.",
            "Quite simply the best backstage musical ever made, and then some.",
            "Tale about \"The Mikado\" and its creators, Gilbert and Sullivan, provides rich cinema.",
            "There are individual scenes that, when looked at by themselves, are knockouts.",
            "A fine and fancy delight, a movie that shows off British director Mike Leigh's uncanny talent for capturing entire worlds in the smallest details.",
            "Leigh is a master at evoking conflicted feelings and recreating in his movies a genuine sense of the complexity and ambiguity of adult experience."

            "Swoopy-haired star Lucas Till makes for a credible young western-style hero, but even he's upended by the often silly, inconsistent story.",
            "The kind of pleasantly eccentric werewolf coming-of-age story that should be seen as the third-billed title in a horror movie marathon. When viewed on its own, one can't help but wonder who \"Wolves\"' was made for.",
            "Wolves limps along with a clunker of a script and unremarkable effects.",
            "As unoriginal as its title, David Hayter's \"Wolves\" is yet another hoary, hairy transformation narrative featuring lycanthropy as a metaphor for coming of age.",
            "The first 30 minutes of this cheap-looking monster drama are admittedly rough going. But once the \"Twilight\"-meets-\"Sons of Anarchy\" silliness kicks in, there's a lovable lunacy at work.",
            "There's modest fun to be had in this campy low-budget horror flick that ultimately doesn't have much bite.",
            "Forgettable werewolf flick is soapy and occasionally gory.",
            "This, as you've doubtless guessed, is all quite silly. And occasionally charming, too, in its wilfully old-fashioned way.",
            "A superhero-style origin story, only one that involves big, hairy, scary werewolves and some True Blood-style lunacy.",
            "It's loud and violent, but the feature drags more than it should, struggling with iffy performances and lousy visual effects to raise a properly furry screen commotion. ",
            "Hayter burns through [his] shocking reveal early, giving his seldom funny, never scary fresh-faced horror-Western a listless quality, even at its slender runtime.",
            "I'm through with silly, lovesick vampires. Bring on the werewolves.",
            "If you're in the bag for werewolves (or have a thing for hairy dudes smoking distinctive pipes), Wolves is a beckoning howl in the night. As an action movie, however, it's surprisingly tame.",
            "[Wolves] is a bland bore, with few memorable character wrinkles or filmmaking flourishes to offset its cheap production values and second-rate story.",
            "Great effects, a few laughs, hot werewolf sex and Jason Momoa as the heavy. Not bad, for a silly werewolf movie. ",
            "A bloody, brutal bore...",
            "The cinematographic approach of the film suggests some unholy hybrid of the aesthetic and genre indulgences of Michael Bay and the hyper-literalist plot construction of Christopher Nolan.",
            "In true 80s throwback fashion, coupled with a hip, sleek and modern look, Wolves is the perfect hybrid between The Howling and Hemlock Grove.",
            "Wolves is part bumbling YA wannabe, part goofy werewolf comedy, but wholly underwhelming no matter how you cut it."

            "A hundred or so minutes of missable anti-entertainment.",
            "Wild Wild West might once have had aspirations of becoming a grand Hollywood entertainment. Along the way, though, it turned into something far more routine, a slick and predictable piece of moviemaking that's ultimately routine and humdrum.",
            "It's exasperating. Best to give a miss to a movie whose title should be Mild, Mild Zest, or just Failed, Failed Jest.",
            "A Smith blockbuster is as much a Fourth of July tradition as parades, barbecue picnics and patriotic speeches, but Wild Wild West is a wet firecracker.",
            "Bolstered by a subtly funny supporting turn by Kevin Kline and a scenery-chewing performance by Kenneth Branagh, Smith carries the movie with his signature ease.",

            "The crimer suffers from a slim, underdeveloped script by Lem Dobbs (who also write Kafka), but benefits from Soderbergh's astute direction that posits two 1960s cinematic icons, Brit Terrence Stamp and American Peter Fonda as long-time enemies.",
            "Those interested in more challenging work will find the film a unique meditation on the nature of Hollywood.",
            "An apparently simple movie that demands and rewards a deeper look.",
            "The film is subtly stolen by Amelia Heinle, joining such actresses as Andie MacDowell, Elisabeth Shue, Betsy Brantley and Jennifer Lopez as the latest in a line of Soderbergh's saving graces.",
            "A first-rate crime thriller and further proof that director Stephen Soderbergh is one of our great contemporary film stylists.",
            "Intoxicatingly well-crafted!",
            "...a high-water-mark in Soderbergh's admittedly spotty body of work.",
            "The Limey is a very simple noir revenge tale, told in broad daylight in a very complicated way.",
            "Assuredly Soderbergh's masterpiece",
            "Not your standard revenge movie, thanks to the inventive and stylish direction of Steven Soderbergh.",
            "A montagem, a interessante utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de imagens de Poor Cow e, claro, a interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o impec\u00e1vel de Stamp transformam um roteiro prosaico em uma experi\u00eancia intrigante.",
            "Soderbergh returns to the crime genre, but The Limey couldn't be more different than Out of Sight, except for the fact that it's just as good.",
            "Bien que le sc\u00e9nario soit plut\u00f4t conventionnel, The Limey am\u00e8ne une bouff\u00e9e de fraicheur au genre gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la touche bien particuli\u00e8re de Soderbergh.",
            "Soderbergh's brilliant non-linear storytelling keeps us asking questions about this gunslinging Brit right to the end.",
            "The movie belongs to Stamp and Fonda.",
            "[Stamp] hasn't had a role like this since his heyday in the '60s and he shows he has been overlooked far too long.",
            "Stamp is the elder statesman of intelligent counterculture cinema, and his performance here makes what is otherwise a lackluster project come energetically alive.",
            "There's more to this crime-thriller than meets the eye.",
            "...a tough, lean revenge picture with a smattering of subtle wit.",
            "It'll serve as perhaps the final reminder of what was once [Soderbergh's] great career.",

            "It's striking that eXistenZ, a send-up of computer games that parodied The Matrix avant la lettre, and one of the great underappreciated movies of the late 1990s, yields the richest trove of relics.",
            "eXistenZ - both Allegra's latest beta release and David Cronenberg's dizzying B-movie - makes the different textures of game, film and life increasingly difficult to tease apart.",
            "I just don't happen to like puzzle films of any kind, but I must credit Mr. Cronenberg with more intellectual depth than most of his fellow pessimistic movie pranksters.",
            "Dark, delirious fun.",
            "It's good art direction in search of an idea.",
            "Though the rigidly wonky lead performances detract from the overall impact of eXistenZ, the feature remains a fun sci-fi romp into the inquisition of reality that hinges on signature Cronenberg style.",
            "[I] thought it was good for what it was but it doesn't really beat other films I've seen like it.",
            "As a multi-layered cautionary tale and satire, perhaps it's brilliant; but by the end, it ultimately seems like a lot of nonsense.",
            "Cronenberg wraps the tale in layers of mystery, never allowing the audience to confidentially comprehend precisely what is happening.",
            "eXistenZ is a hugely enjoyable SF thriller with a playfulness to its narrative that keeps you well and truly baffled as too where you are.",
            "The world Cronenberg creates is his least immersive to date, but more interesting is his critique of what games and other forms of media do to our lives.",
            "This is a David Cronenberg movie, so everything looks vaguely like a vagina.",
            "It's a disturbing, disorienting sensation -- puzzles within puzzles, games within games -- that continues right up to the last shot.",
            "Experienced gamers should find much to savor through the films unique assessments on the nature of reality.",
            "[Cronenberg is] a laughing existentialist here, a philosopher who sees the comedy in disorientation.",
            "Brave moviegoers and fans of writer-director David Cronenberg will find funny dialogue and grotesquely engrossing scenes in his latest sci-fi horror tale.",
            "Fans may find certain similarities between eXistenZ and Videodrome bothersome, but both films are the real thing.",
            "An evolution for the filmmaker that will reach maturity in the quiet, devastatingly economical eloquence of Spider."

            "It's a solidly entertaining effort -- the kind of movie that can be enjoyed by anyone who appreciates discerning comedy.",
            "If a part of me has resisted and sometimes even resented his mastery, this undoubtedly can be traced to a problem with realism that his work as a whole throws into relief. To put it crudely, why reproduce the real world when we have the thing itself?",
            "The latest in a long, rich series of films by the perceptive French director, who tells stories about people we'd like to know, or be.",
            "The generation gap between heart and mind and youth and maturity is sharply underscored in this introspective study, with Libolt a standout as the dating game's befuddled, charming pawn.",
            "Here, in vigorous old age, comes another master: Eric Rohmer, age 79, whose Autumn Tale is now brightening the lives of all who watch it.",
            "This was Rohmer's fourth and final film about the seasonal cycle and it might be his best one, letting in the most sunlight.",
            "The he-said, she-said shenanigans suggest that high school may be eternal but autumn has its wisdom. In the last scene, the 78-year-old filmmaker brings his favorite conspirator back for a last dance -- it's a vintage performance that invites applause."

            "Steve Zahn shines in Illsley's feature debut, elevating this eccentric small-town comedy two notches above the level of writing. Using the fish out of water format, this Sundance premiere begins well but then declines rapidly.",
            "...although it reverts to slapstick for its set-piece chase finale, for most of its length Mark Illsley's debut film offers an unexpectedly gentle, even sentimental comedy of sexual identities...",
            "A charming fish-out-of-water romantic comedy, the modestly budgeted Happy, Texas more than makes up in heart what it lacks in splash.",
            " Happy, Texas is a hoot, a hilarious comedy that's smart and caring, yet sexy and ingenious enough that it just might stir up some of that elusive Full Monty-style box-office appeal.",
            "Happy, Texas is a light, breezy and very amusing comedy.",
            "...if the world is not exactly aching from a lack of fish-out-of-water criminal capers, Happy, Texas nevertheless pleasingly proves that even a shtick we've seen before can charm when it's done well.",
            " It is a film I love, a film I watch regularly, and a film that makes me laugh each and every time.",
            "Every bit as cheery as the title implies--but good will can only go so far.",
            "first-time filmmaker Illsley displays a surprisingly firm yet gentle hand with both his script and his enormously appealing cast.",
            "Odd couple buddy picture with Rom-Com elements that work. Zhan gives one of his most hysterical performances to date. Lighthearted, watchable, and fun.",
            "The set-up is so strong that it's impressive to see it progress so effortlessly.",
            "Very, very, tears-rolling-down-your-face funny.",
            "Bank-robbery/beauty-pageant caper is sweet, silly fun.",
            "...an irresistibly winsome and winning comedy...",
            "It's a breath of fresh air to review a film that, having received an award from the Sundance Film Festival, actually deserves the accolade.",
            "Jeremy Northam gives a deft performance and Steve Zahn is especially brilliant in delineating his character's transformation from illiterate lug to finicky choreographer."

            "A funny, insightful film whose feminist undertones don't overwhelm the story and characters.",
            "Not to beat a metaphor to death, but since hitting a high note with The Piano, Jane Campion's career has gone off-key.",
            "The film's only moments of electricity come in its first ten minutes, as its two stars are introduced to strains of Neil Diamond's \"Holly Holy\" and \"I Am, I Said.\"",

            "Shyamalan remains unable to wholeheartedly capture the viewer's interest for the duration of the movie's slightly overlong running time. ",

            "It takes you on an intriguing, unsettling journey.",

            "Another \"could-have-been\" film, another almost successful compromise, another intelligent flick done in by its misplaced and worn-out star.",
            "If ultimately there is less to Sense than meets the eye, director-writer M. Night Shyamalan (Wide Awake) at least avoids gory cheap thrills in favor of muted chills. He bears watching.",
            "A delicate, emotionally attentive, but very scary ghost story.",
            " I was not only surprised by the film's final twist, I wasn't even looking for one. I just thought I was watching a bad movie. The end doesn't quite redeem it, but it makes you think about what you've seen. That's a saving grace of some sort.",
            "Shyamalan's script is a clever construct, but also contains a great deal of sensitivity to the plight of the \"different\" child.",
            "Like Kieslowski and others, Shyamalan knows that what makes for lousy metaphysics can make for powerful metaphor, and in the end he creates a deeply, surprisingly affecting film out of a little bit of smoke and brimstone."

            "As well-intentioned as it may be, \"Edge of Seventeen\" is filled with cliched dialogue, stereotypical characterizations and predictable plotting.",

            "A film more easily admired than enjoyed, but there is much to admire in this bold, unsettling film.",
            "Although Head On has a certain rude power, it's definitely not a date flick.",
            "Its missteps and excesses aside, Head On is a promising feature film debut for Kokkinos.",

            "Seventy years on such sombreness seems timely, as does Harry Lime, Welles's deliciously elusive antihero.",
            "Krasker's camera reveals a dank, matte, defeated city - so dully vivid as to be a character unto itself - except that this Vienna becomes something altogether different seen at night or underground.",
            "Reed and screenwriter Graham Greene let the story unfold slowly and deliberately, like the cigarette smoke that floats around the characters, and keep us guessing at every step.",
            "Like many, I have loved this thriller of conscience and betrayal most of my moviegoing life.",
            "This is a film which does away with such cretinous inanity as offering up goodies and baddies, instead presenting its cast of characters as doing things which they believe to be good, but are not seen as such through the eyes of observers.",
            "\"The Third Man\" is important not just because of its technique but because of its theme ...",
            "As a mystery, it is average - but as a darkly artistic approach to intrigue, it's masterful.",
            "The writing, the acting, the music, and the locations are so distinct and recognizable that they have become lodged in our consciousness.",
            "The astounding acting bit, it may turn out, is that contributed by Orson Welles. As the object of this chilling search, Welles for once is pulled back to the size of a gifted actor, a trick for which he and a lot of old Welles' admirers can thank Reed.",
            "The music is as distinctive as the James Bond or Star Wars theme...",
            "This film is lively, always moving forward, constantly bubbling with mystery and suspicion and secrets, but the characters are always driving the film.",
            "We're seduced out of caring for Greene's weary plot. Welles saves the film and destroys it.",
            "By the very nature of its settings and story, there are occasional reminiscences of Lang and Hitchcock, but there is nothing borrowed or imitated. Stylistically, The Third Man is Reed's most impressive film.",
            "Welles was a still-ridiculously young 34 when he played Harry, but he was probably born sounding 56...",
            "The bombed buildings, piles of rubble and their evocative shadows form a haunting backdrop to the outdoor scenes, particularly at night. ... Greene's talent for dialogue and suspense shine. [It] has more twists and turns than a rollercoaster.",
            "It's an exciting experience, dazzling and entertaining and thought-provoking.",
            "What really makes the film sing, though, isn't the jaunty and iconic zither score by Anton Karas. It's the film's groundbreaking visual aesthetic, which combines noir tropes with expressionism to create a visual wonderland of living shadows. ",
            "Few films more effectively capture the crumbling infrastructure and opportunistic lawlessness of postwar Europe. And none better translate the snaking treachery of Graham Greene's stories and his worlds of cynical expats and casual betrayal.",
            "Set in postwar occupied Vienna, the plot is a corker, littered with memorable moments and played to perfection by an unforgettable cast that's led with distinction by Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten.",
            "Best read not as an homage to Hitchcock - or to special super secret guest star Orson Welles - than as a study of what Carol Reed biographer Robert F. Moss describes as 'the ineffectuality of goodness.'",
            "A lot funnier than you remember it, Carol Reed's immortal 1949 film noir seems to exist in the space between two worlds: an earlier time when thrillers were mostly serious affairs, and a future one, when such supremely witty entertainments felt pass\u00e9.",
            "The Third Man is a movie of sobering pleasures.",
            "The movie's verve comes from the abstract use of a jangling zither and from squirting Orson Welles into the plot piece-meal with a tricky, facetious eyedropper.",
            "The truth is often what one least expects it to be, and the ability to cope with the seemingly unbelievable is a dividing line between Reed's characters."

            "While undeniably beautiful, it carries little more than the obvious voyeuristic appeal.",
            "It's unclear if Van Sant intends to inspire guilt; here, as elsewhere, he is exasperatingly abstruse. And in this striving to not say too much, he ends up not saying much of anything at all.",
            "Pitt's performance is a quiet performance.",

            "Don't send out the condolences just yet. The movie isn't about the director's death--if anything, it proves that Van Sant is very much alive.",

            "It's like a novel written entirely in italics, every single sentence of which ends with an exclamation mark. As there are people of whom it's said that they don't know their own strength, Kusturica is a film-maker who doesn't know his own brilliance.",
            "There's a surprising warmth and even a little optimism behind Kusturica's gallows humor.",

            "A hilarious screwball masterpiece.",
            "Often funny, but more often feels like you're missing an inside joke somewhere. ",

            "Their largely negative or only superficially positive responses make me feel guilty about finding the series so fascinating -- and should make the filmmakers feel even guiltier.",

            "One of the best movie series ever is a true-life drama like no other. Miss it at your peril.",
            "Two subjects acknowledge their conjoined lifeline, become best friends, and as a result a life is forever changed.",
            "As beneficial as helmer's influence may be to that aging franchise, his work here reps a fascinating use of the docu form.",
            "This movie is a living artifact that does what movies do best: exist in time. May this series continue up, up, and beyond.",
            "42 Up is a delightful and moving look at humanity through the singular stories of this captivating group.",
            "Perfect. An absolute must-see.",
            "Part of Apted seminal docu series that began with 7Up, then 14, 28, and 35, this chapter centers on the subjects as they head into middle-age, with all its compromises and disappointments.",
            "This series remains as fascinating as it did when it started - a lifetime ago.",
            "A fascinating entry in Michael Apted's long-running documentary series.",
            "This fascinating ongoing sociological document and human drama by its very nature gets better with each progressive installment.",
            "42 Up engages you in ways that other movies can't; it works emotional muscles you may not know you have.",
            "Convinces us that the journey of every human being is eminently edifying and compelling. ",
            "Let it go, Michael. Your subjects are obviously ready to do the same.",
            "If only because its foreignness allows it to come to terms with one of the great taboo subjects in our national life, 42 Up is a tremendously valuable film.",
            "The grand, class-society-embracing conception of this film has become too rich for its narrow stylistic confines.",
            "Running just over two hours, the documentary itself is cold and stale.",
            "A bit slower and heavier, but its connection of past and present yields more subtle character twists and contradictions than ever before."

            "Kubrick's final film is unique in his oeuvre for concluding on a note of apparent affirmation. ",
            "This is finally a film that is better at mood than substance, that has its strongest hold on you when it's making the least amount of sense.",
            "It's empty of ideas, which is fine, but it's also empty of heat.",
            "At least Fellini pulled out the stops from the first minute when he wanted to get surreal. Here, realism fades into surrealism, then into outright foolishness. Morbidly paced foolishness.",
            "Cruise in particular lays himself open in that fiercely committed way that he tries everything as an actor.",
            "It's as rich and strange and riveting as any journey he's taken us on, yet it's also familiar in a disquieting way.",
            "Kubrick's last film has aged very well. Its depiction of honesty within a high class marriage and the consequences, is as valid as it is dangerous. [Full review in Spanish].",
            "Eyes Wide Shut (1999) is legendary director Stanley Kubrick's highly-anticipated, last completed film. It was titled 'Eyes Wide Shut' to imply self-contradictory opposites: at first being exposed or tempted, and then reflexively turning away...",
            "Eyes Wide Shut has gotten better with age. It was, in Nietzsche's word, untimely; its first audiences failed to understand it, while its real contemporaries had to bide their time.",
            "Eyes Wide Shut reveals new truths with each viewing.",
            "A film so willing to explore the limitations of masculinity, the limitations of heterosexuality, and the limitations of what fantasy looks like for a man who has none, is a decidedly interesting, and queer, work with which to end one's filmmaking career.",
            "This is not the steamy sexual extravaganza we have been promised, but it is provocative. In its own tormented way, Eyes Wide Shut is a valentine to monogamy.",
            "It was a knockout in the first round. Kubrick's fluid camerawork lulled them. ",
            "This is, one might argue, what the audience has paid to see and what they've always wanted to see: the then-most famous couple in the world, at home in both the literal and figurative sense, unguarded and au naturel.",
            "In Eyes Wide Shut nothing works.",
            "A delicious, deadpan farce about the fragile masculine ego. ",
            "The film does have that advertised haunting quality, and at least one performance from Kidman, in a supporting, but vital role that's as good as any we're likely to see this year.",
            "The price of Kubrick and Raphael's stubborn fidelity to the content if not the form of the novella is deadly.",
            "Maybe we should suspend the reductive question, \"Is it any good or not?\" and acknowledge that it's a fascinating, tantalising film that will continue to be argued about.",
            "Long and dull, despite the sumptuous production design and light-shimmering photography (and the orgy).",
            "In the final analysis, the marquee names are all that really distinguish Eyes Wide Shut from, say, a really well-photographed installment in the Emmanuelle series.",
            "The result doesn't begin to live up to such pomp; indeed, it is so deliberately paced and so strangely devoid of emotional stakes that maybe it proves that too much control isn't such a good thing.",
            "Eyes Wide Shut is above all a masterpiece of sustained tone, a tightrope act that pays off in rich and unexpected ways.",
            "It's a movie you should see a second time to appreciate fully its themes of love and lust and trust and truth, but the idea of sitting through it again anytime soon may be about as alluring as eating a hairball."

            "While the storyline has few surprises, the central performances create a touching relationship, despite the suspicion that the male writer/director's interest in the subject is slightly dubious, or at least tokenistic.",
            "Dahlstr\u00f6m and especially Liljeberg are first-rate.",
            "Moodysson's story may be an old one -- the taboo romance between lovers from different ends of the school spectrum -- but his sharp script refreshes old themes.",
            "High school, small town, teenagers in hormone hell -- or is that heaven?",
            "A charming teen comedy from Sweden.",
            "Lukas Moodyson's debut feature has a grainy, immediate feel that nicely enhances the story's emotional honesty -- a quality that our own popular teen movies have only just begun to embrace.",
            "A simple, charming, and slightly edgy romance between two teenage girls.",
            "Nobody can deny the honesty or the outright sincerity this film has.",
            "Unfortunately, as the plot develops, it shies away from exploring that discontent, in favor of demonstrating precisely the kind of naivet\u00e9 and sweetness that one would expect to find in any teen romance.",
            "I must have missed what the Swedes see in this film. I found it mildly interesting at best.",
            "It's just an incredibly insightful character drama about true, awkward, beautiful first love, and it's all the better for it. Oh, and that last shot is as cute as it gets.",
            "It's an awkward, unapologetic, unconventional -- and ultimately winning -- look at first love, one that unabashedly portrays the complications and confusion that result from those first crushes and rushes of attraction and passion.",
            "The two lead performances by Dahlstroem and Liljeberg are entirely naturalistic.",
            "...a warm coming-of-age story that happens to be a coming-out story.",
            "El t\u00edtulo original (en los EUA se exhibi\u00f3 bajo el nombre de Show Me Love) es llamativo: Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l no s\u00f3lo sugiere indirectamente el sexo ...",
            "It's worth going out of your way to witness one of the year's best films.",

            "A completely charming reality-based romantic fantasy, both sweet-natured and sympathetic.",

            " Invites and encourages us to reap the blessings of true connection with others.",

            "This is not a masterpiece, but it contains moments of rare beauty and its contemplation of life, death, regret, and memory has a subtle power.",
            "Consider giving this worthy anachronism a couple of hours of your time. If you can tune into its somber, hypnotic wavelength, you may be surprised at the raw emotional impact it delivers in key scenes, and at its ability to provoke your imagination.",
            "It is a statement about the work of an artist, a collector of diverse elements then molded into a coherent, beautiful whole.",
            "Angelopoulos has created another masterpiece, one that recalls such classics as Bergman's Wild Strawberries and Kurosawa's Ikiru.",

            "A kaleidoscopic but engrossing study of the shifting sands of friendship among a group of Parisians.",
            "It's a bit like a Woody Allen film without the kvetching or the wisecracks, but younger and more vital.",
            "Denis Lenoir's camera is almost always on the move, shoulder-borne, shuddering or looking for blurred close-up detail to put to use in the film's transitional sequences.",
            "The film doesn't leave the audience with a moral. It just leaves a sense of having been in the stimulating company of passionate people.",
            "The individual plot lines fit together seamlessly and the cast is easy on the eye, but this melancholy trawl through the quagmire of modern relationships is not outstanding.",
            "Assayas avoids easy resolutions, and Ali Farka Toure's score reminds us that each year brings with it a possibility that one will change the cycle.",
            "The characters are all properly engaging and interesting, but the story feels the same as many others I've seen.",
            "clever and thoughtful",
            "Assayas puts a shiny gloss on those who choose to live loose lives...",
            "The cast is full of talented French actors -- Virginie Ledoyen, Francois Cluzet, Mathieu Amalric, Jeanne Balibar -- who play people with flaws and fears and who eventually reach a tender understanding.",
            "Reveals the terrible fragility of male friendship and the ways in which it often disappoints those who invest it with burdens it cannot bear.",
            "This is a slow, talky movie that seems to drift aimlessly without finding an involving storyline.",
            "Although we cannot take our eyes off Ms. Balibar, whose performance is remarkable in its understated range of emotion, she is the only character with whom we can connect.",
            "If Assayas doesn't always transport his film's events beyond the all too commonplace, his understatement can also yield moments of quiet simplicity.",
            "It is, in many ways, a modest film. But a director who offers glimpses of life that are recognizable in both detail and texture isn't so common that we can afford to overlook what he has achieved here.",
            "The results may not be completely original or thought-provoking, but on whole, the movie is refreshingly honest and heartfelt.",
            "The cast, including Virginie Ledoyen, Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet, and Mathieu Amalric, is as well coordinated as a fine chamber-music ensemble; their entrances and vanishings and re-entries play like recurring motifs.",
            "Assayas creates among the most well-realized characters in current cinema."

            "Lush, star-studded movies like The Talented Mr. Ripley teach us to yearn: for Europe, for charisma, for nice furniture and idler times. The Talented Mr. Ripley also teaches us how poisonous that longing can be.",

            "A \"10 Best\" achievement, thanks to writer-director Anthony Minghella's acute interpretation of Patricia Highsmith's novel, a shooting style that wallows in decadence and danger, and a choice cast completely in sync with the stringent demands of the story.",
            "Full of murder and deceit; too violent for kids.",
            "The blend of Minghella's gloss and Damon's steel results in a psychological thriller of huge style and depth. A very good movie.",

            "Musing on the power of inner thought and imagination, the film is far from deep, but instead feels superficial and one-dimensional.",
            "While famous for crafting films about incommunicability and alienation, Antonioni here delivers one that simply communicates nothing at all.",
            "None of these stories, except the first, incises deeply, but all of them are immersed in a sense of place, riche but not nouveau riche, no ostentation. Some old Antonioni elements and some new ones are used.",

            "It's amazing how much action can be crammed into a movie about a war where most soldiers didn't actually see any action. Three Kings has its fair share of shootouts, none that are merely squeezed in for guilty pleasures. Every shot fired is motivated by c",
            "A damning yet idealistic satire about the motives behind U.S. foreign policy.",
            "The last reel descends into a muddle of trade-offs, heroic about-turns and romanticised rebels, but this is defiant, provocative cinema; Russell may yet prove a film-maker to treasure.",
            "No, Three Kings is not a great picture, but it is a very good one, perhaps the first feature of merit to come out of the Gulf War.",
            "What lingers in the mind far longer than the smart dialogue, the slightly cartoon characterisations or the neat feel-good ending is a vivid sense of the sickening nature of modern warfare.",
            "One of Hollywood's few films about the Gulf War, David O. Russell's Three Kings is an original war feature that's effective as a social satire as well as political critique.",
            "Violent, liberal George Clooney Gulf War caper.",
            "Ithis is a career making movie, then its writer/director David O. Russell who deserves the credit with this very creative effort from the debut filmmaker.",
            "Three Kings mightn't be the best thought-out or most reassuring movie of the year, but the more I think about it, the more I'm sure that it is one of the best.",
            "Far more intelligent and perceptive than most actioners, yet with enough thrills and spills to satisfy adrenaline junkies.",
            "(The) screenplay abruptly changes tone after the first half-hour, eventually incorporating some genuinely harrowing sequences... The final picture becomes something noticeably deeper and smarter than its first reels suggest.",
            "Worth watching.",
            "With characters you can root for and a story that is both engaging and honest, Three Kings goes for the gold and comes out a winner.",
            "Keilich strikes a sweetly engaging balance between humor and pathos.",
            "An action movie with a conscience.",
            "Go see it for the effects, action and treasure hunt story, but enjoy the intelligence, too.",
            "It's an outrageous comedy and a challenging morality play, while at heart its a classic Western (set in an unlikely context).",
            "Combinando humor e drama com talento, funciona como uma dura cr\u00edtica \u00e0 pol\u00edtica belicista dos EUA - sendo t\u00e3o (ou mais) relevante hoje em dia do que quando foi lan\u00e7ado.",
            "The violence and profanity are there, but so is a sharp-edged political point of view, interesting characters and a plot enhanced with dark humor.",
            "A map that leads as near to the Iraqi heart as we can find in American movies.",

            "It's wretchedly predictable, inconsistently funny and not always well-written. It's enjoyable enough, but a truly good movie it's not.",
            "Considering that all of us (even, one surmises, the young viewers smack in the hairlines of this movie's demographic gunsights) can guess where this story is going, why is the last third of this film so unrelentingly slow?",
            "The dance stops eventually, and then those darn kids start talking again. Way to ruin the mood.",

            "Perhaps it is postmodern filmmaking, whatever that means. In any case, Fight Club remains the ugliest, most inhuman film since Natural Born Killers.",
            "The movie demands a certain attention and is not easily dismissed, but there is something deeply unsettling about a work that uncritically espouses brutality as a function of alienation and nonconformity.",
            "An outrageous mixture of brilliant technique, puerile philosophizing, trenchant satire and sensory overload, Fight Club is the most incendiary movie to come out of Hollywood in a long time. It's a mess, but one worth fighting about.",
            "Oh, for the time when men were men and were encouraged to beat the tar out of one another. That's the world \"Fight Club\" pines for.",
            "Fight Club jettisons its sense of humour 60 minutes in, and, so far from satirising the tiresome \"crisis of masculinity\" stuff sloshing around the airwaves either side of the Atlantic, the film simply endorses it.",
            "It is working American Beauty-Susan Faludi territory, that illiberal, impious, inarticulate fringe that threatens the smug American center with an anger that cannot explain itself, can act out its frustrations only in inexplicable violence.",
            "Unsubtle subliminal messages pair with skewed perceptions to demonstrate overstressed stylization and a hopelessly circuitous plot.",
            "'Fight Club' examines David Fincher's portrait of toxic masculinity from the female gaze.",
            "Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are both perfect in David Fincher's anarchic, moody and violent film. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "The film's tongue is far too firmly in its cheek at all points of its discourse to ever take its characters' actions too much at face value.",
            "Pitt dominates the screen every second he's on it, and it simultaneously represents his weirdest, funniest and most charismatic role of his career.",
            "Filmmaker David Fincher has, perhaps notoriously, infused Fight Club with a decidedly off-kilter sort of vibe that's reflected in its various attributes...",
            "Mr Loaf was never better on screen than as the ill-fated, big-hearted Bob Paulson, the only warm character in a cold, cold movie.",
            "Just when it's supposedly getting to grips with its theme, the movie goes utterly haywire and becomes yet another brainless, humourless bone-cruncher.",
            "...capturing perfectly the stirring discontent of the 90s & the madness (geopolitical/economic) that would erupt globally in the decade to come. For in his love of anarchic (self-)destruction, Tyler shows the new Millennium through a glass darkly.",
            "Technically gorgeous... But it's such a wreck of tone and intellect.",
            "Fight Club may be iconic and technically proficient, but it's more distant than perhaps any film to attain \"modern classic\" status.",
            "perhaps the most post-9/11 film to have been made pre-9/11, capturing perfectly both the stirring discontent of the Nineties and the madness (both geopolitical and especially economic) that would erupt globally in the decade to come.",
            "Wildly inventive, exceptionally cast and undeniably controversial, there's an endless list of subtexts and viewpoints which will fuel student pub debates for years.",
            "A controversial satire and a contemporary classic.",
            "Blistering, hallucinatory, often brilliant, the film by David Fincher is a combination punch of social satire and sociopathology.",
            "Fight Club is an arresting, eventually appalling excursion into social satire by way of punishing violence.",
            "A movie that wants to keep its audience unsettled from beginning to end.",
            "We're meant to take the male bonding and the blood rituals as a protest against the sterility of corporate life and modern design, but Fincher's sadomasochistic kicks overwhelm any possible social critique."

            "Mr. Irving remains a disturbingly facile spinner of yarns in which the most sordid facts of life are glossed over into comfortably didactic homilies about the innate goodness of people. Yet, I was somehow moved...",
            "Hallstr\u00f6m's humanism is possibly a little low key and romantic given such tough themes as abortion and incest.",
            "What's bizarre about the movie is how it grafts greeting-card schmaltz on to a muckraking liberal agenda.",
            "[It] is a fable that turns into a 1940s New England variation on Charles Dickens. It is also one dickens of an American movie.",
            "While Rudd has rarely delved into the sincerely dramatic, he acquits himself well in a key role in this unorthodox weepie.",
            "Irving's clean, economical dialogue and Hallstrom's beautifully morose direction cut the fat off of the cliches.",

            "It blends romance with the love of children, the warmth of family with the darker side of human nature, and the all-encompassing belief that everything has a purpose.",
            "What the film is really about are CHOICES: the need to make them, how they affect others, and actively dealing with the repercussions of your actions.",
            "It is worth mentioning that this movie looks like a million bucks; cinematographer Oliver Stapleton drenches the scenery in rich, antique tones that add luster to the story's poignant emotion.",
            "It doesn't break anything, but it doesn't have to. I smiled a lot, sometimes had misty eyes and never lost interest.",
            "Presents a fresh and forceful salute to the spiritual practice of self-esteem.",
            "an extremely pretty movie to look at and listen to, but although Irving's basic plot remains, the richness of his prose hasn't truly transferred to the screen.",

            "Michael Mann's least physically violent film feels no less ferocious -especially given the appetites with which corporations gobble up media today. Holding off barbarians at the gate is only noble until you must sell them the gate to fund the fight.",
            "A supremely suspenseful and riveting dramatic tour-de-force.",

            "It has a buzz of excitement and complexity -- the sense that we're seeing the actual back-room decisions that affect lives.",
            "The ingredients--topical subject, great acting from Crowe and Plummer, Mann's brillaint helming--are here for a truly great film and yet something is missing, perhaps a sense of deja vu of case well covered in the press, or an aura of pompous seriousness.",
            "The Insider is an engaging, beautifully-paced drama that leaves most others like it looking silly and amateurish.",
            "The movie reveals Michael Mann's unparalleled ability to fashion taut suspense from unpromising material.",
            "Director Mich\u00e6l Mann makes the mundane exciting -- even though we all know the outcome -- with his trademark blue/dark back lighting, hyper-kinetic editing and a haunting techno score.",
            "A compelling, tautly depicted tale of corporate power and individual integrity. Director Mann may well have an Oscar contender here.",
            "This is a war movie. The big strikes are lawsuits. The battlefield is the conscience. And the heroes put themselves on the front lines for the sake of the truth.",
            "It won't be popular with tobacco executives, who come off as menacing, but here's betting they'll be among the first to see it.",
            "Credit co-author and director Michael Mann for infusing with wit a film that easily could have been unbearably pretentious, and credit Al Pacino, who plays producer Bergman, for doing the same for his character.",

            "For Love of the Game asks whether the same qualities that make an athlete a champion don't also destroy his happiness. The answer, unfortunately, is long-winded and redundant... But some of the baseball scenes are good.",
            "This is no perfect -- or even half-perfect -- game. It's another movie where conventions are subbed for life lessons, where the emotions are cued by golden oldies and where the motivation (at least on the studio's part) isn't love of the game but money.",
            "Here are two things that definitely don't go together: baseball and piano music.",
            "The baseball sequences are fabulous, not least because Costner looks and moves like a real player a rarity for actors in sports movies... But the love story, a five-year off-and-on affair, is little more than a sop to Costner's romantic faithful.",
            "On the field, Costner is consistent, but his exploration of Billy's romantic dilemma is superficial and often wooden.",
            "Those flashbacks will drive you nuts. As if baseball didn't drag on long enough, almost every inning or out of that Yankees game is punctuated by a memory.",
            "\"Bull Durham\" is a more powerful movie than \"For Love of the Game,\" so Kevin Costner might be better as a savvy minor league catcher than a hall-of-fame major league pitcher, but the fact is, Costner is simply and utterly baseballic. He's baseballerific.",

            "For Love of the Game's earnestness seems itself like a desperate cry for attention.",
            "Far more horrifying than Evil Dead, Sam Raimi's attempt at making a sports-oriented romance strikes out, forfeits and loses three times before its two hours and 10 minutes are up.",
            "Like Billy this movie is good on the field, but not so much once off it.",
            "For love of the God, what is wrong with the once-likable Kevin Costner?",
            "I'm all for romance, you understand. But what makes this a drawback is that these people are all wrong for each other and that the filmmakers don't seem to know it.",
            "The rhythms of the game feel right; the rhythms of the romance feel embarrassingly Harlequin, and the picture drags on for over two hours.",
            "Vanity is one thing, but Costner's act is beginning to feel like a particularly self-righteous -- and tiresome -- form of pathology. Someone should tell him that an actor's job is to disappear into his characters, not vice-versa.",
            "Not a frame reflects the distinctively edgy touch that director Sam Raimi brought to films as diverse as The Evil Dead and A Simple Plan.",

            "Garish and not funny enough, Wilson's shapeless satire plods on, squandering its nice premise and its appealing actors. Miraculously, Fraser has a force field around him and manages to radiate energy in this comic black hole.",
            "Thanks to a clever script, tight direction, a first-rate cast and the dynamite combination of Brendan Fraser and Alicia Silverstone, Blast from the Past blows away the recent crop of romantic comedies.",
            "That's a relatively clever set-up for what's become a familiar genre: the time-displacement comedy, in which we get a kick out of viewing our era through another era's eyes. But this movie's eyes, Adam's, are awfully twinkly and not too focused.",

            "It's pleasant enough, with Fraser's goofy charm particularly winning.",
            "Despite its faintly mechanical construction, Blast From The Past is very classy, and the improbable comic duo of Spacek and Walken provide the manic edge. Silverstone is good, engagingly grouchy but Fraser is indeed a blast.",
            "Unfortunately Mr. Fraser comes off as a forlorn, outsize Pee Wee Herman.",
            "The 40-minute setup is deliciously nutty, with eccentric turns from Walken and Spacek. But the longer Adam remains above ground, the more plodding and predictable the scenario becomes.",
            "Despite its original concept, the movie loses much of its socially satiric edge once Fraser emerges from his underground bunker and starts wooing Silverstone.",
            "Blast From the Past doesn't overtax Fraser's abilities -- the film is only a sweet comic confection -- but director and co-writer Hugh Wilson does rely on a rare quality that Fraser has in spades: charm.",
            "A stretched-out anecdote.",
            "Blast From the Past has a sweet, joyful spirit and some fun performances.",
            "There's something a little bit creepy and Dole-like about the notion that 35 years ago, everything was good and pure and right (except for that whole Cold War mess), while today, everything has become debased and confusing.",
            "Blast From the Past hits all the right notes.",
            "Blast from the Past is a cute idea that delivers a few good scenes, but not enough to make the movie consistently entertaining.",
            "In Blast From the Past, Brendan Fraser certainly fits in the title role. He's a blast -- goofy, wide-eyed and romantic, continuing his impeccable streak of making OK movies (including this one) far more watchable than they should be.",
            "Ultimately, this is a culture clash movie between two eras of American life. Without advocating a complete return to innocence, Blast From the Past is a gentle reminder of what Americans may have lost by growing so jaded."

            " a surprisingly tender and humane movie that seems touchingly confident of God's sense of humor and infinite patience",
            "The film takes aim at so many contemporary targets and with such gusto that you fear each time you laugh you might be missing another wonderful line.",

            "This is Spacey's best performance since he took home an Oscar for The Usual Suspects.",
            "This engrossing centrepiece meshes with subplots involving Burnham's dysfunctional family and unbalanced neighbours, in a virtuoso study of isolation, repression and fulfilment. Mendes infuses the lush visuals and lyrical script with dramatic panache.",
            "With its parade of neurotics, psychotics, bigots and deceivers, American Beauty is an endlessly rewatchable black comedy.",
            "Why, then, did I enjoy it so little? Because of its unrelenting self-importance: American Beauty wants us to know, in every shot at every turn, just how clever and mercilessly cutting it is.",
            "It's a love story, a tale of redemption, a drama of unraveling lifestyles and psychological corrosion, and a poetic tragedy, all wrapped up together.",
            "[The skewed morality] is not a happy note. But it is a powerful one. That's the thing that makes American Beauty such a compelling feature even now. ",

            "American Beauty (1999) is a tragic, absurdist, satirical and dark domestic tale - and the debut feature film of British-London theatrical-stage director Sam Mendes. ",
            "As faux-deep Oscar bait goes, American Beauty is as broad and predictable as an episode of Three's Company. ",
            "American Beauty wields its title as a double-edged sword -- as a profoundly harsh and ironic assertion of misplaced values and wasted lives on one side; but as a subtle statement of hope and kindness on the other",
            "We never really see the downtrodden nature of Burnham's life pre-awakening, we just take it as a given from Burnham's own sarcastic narration.",
            "The highly entertaining dark comedy American Beauty uses its cardboard characters very well.",
            "...magnificent, fresh, debatable, funny and tragicomic. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "This seriocomic autopsy of middle-class virtue has the capacity to startle and surprise, and a gift for finding grim humor at the heart of tragedy.",
            "The writing is acidically amusing without ever trying to conceal the loneliness at the heart, the direction a perfect frame for the characters and the wonderful performances that create them.",
            "Kevin Spacey is the greatest actor of his generation, hands down, no contest.",
            "The film is stunningly poignant, and when first time cinema director Mendes turns his hands to the serious aspects of the disintegration of human souls, the funny lurches to the profound with hardly a flicker of disruption.",
            "Mendes loves his performers, framing their big moments with suburban metaphors and dizzily poetic fantasies.",
            "A truly beautiful, poignant and brilliantly funny film, it doesn't get much better than this.",
            "It took a British stage director to create the ultimate movie about the American family.",
            "Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his life.",
            "Alan Ball's script is a terrific piece of material, and Mendes responds directly to its subversive, provocative vision of a curdled American Dream."

            "In its eagerness to give voice to the overshadowed daughter, the film never allows the mother to live.",
            "The movie drops in on a crucial part of their lives, follows it for a few minutes and then jettisons to another episode. It's like watching 10 short stories.",
            "Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman put on an acting clinic that's a treat to watch, but, no matter how accomplished, a clinic is not a movie. They do a lot with a little, yet it's far from enough.",

            "The movie doesn't feel authentic, it's relationships are drawn in erratic, TV movie-like strokes.",
            "Wang keeps a precise balance, necessary to blend a high-octane performance from Sarandon with an understated one from Portman.",
            "The delicate, devastating pas de deux between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman demonstrates that great actresses are still available, even if Hollywood doesn't want to use them.",
