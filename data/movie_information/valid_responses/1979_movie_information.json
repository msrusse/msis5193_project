            "An artless, non-stop barrage of off-the-wall situations, funny and unfunny jokes, generally effective and sometimes hilarious sight gags and bawdy non sequiturs.",
            "The comedy runs out of steam when the jerk makes good, but laugh for laugh it's probably a better investment than 10.",
            "We get the sense at times that the cast and crew arrived at a location, found the script bankrupt of real laughs, and started looking around for funny props.",
            "The laughs aren't steady, but they're persistent, and the film moves fast enough to compensate for its unevenness.",
            "The ingenious thing about this film is the way it can take serious situations and drastically interfere with them using an unexpected comedy device.",
            "Carl Reiner, who has made his own contributions to comedy with Sid Caesar, Mel Brooks and Dick Van Dyke, does little to set a mood or rhythm or even an aura of good feeling that will carry audiences over the slow spots.",
            "It's just a strange little movie.",
            "Basically a series of skits that are barely tethered to a plot, this works better than expected, thanks primarily to Martin's infectious performance.",
            "Bernadette Peters...nearly steals the show from Martin's over-the-top antics. It's sweet, and funny, and includes one of the most quotable exit lines in film history. ",
            "An oddball odyssey so strange, filled with non-sequiturs so funny, and decorated by a romance so sweet, it was an inevitable star-maker.",
            "92 minutes of direct and sweet surrealism",
            "If only he could have satisfied himself with this area of expertise, people would still talk of Steve Martin as one of the kings of comic cinema.",
            "The whole thing is uneven and slight, but the highlight moments guilty-pleasure us with the sort of stupid-funny that's 'LOL' quotable afterward.",
            "Steve Martin is at the height of his comic powers in this very un-PC comedy.",
            "While The Jerk is an extremely episodic little movie, that's a malady easily forgiven -- simply because the episodes are so damn funny.",

            "The film should not come as a complete surprise to anyone who has been paying attention to Allen's doings lately. This is the movie that Annie Hall hinted at and to which last year's Interiors, flawed as it was, seems to have served as a necessary prelude.",
            "Allen serves up a nostalgia that was utterly of its time; he incarnates an idea of the city that, even now, remains as strong as its reality and refracts his disappointed ideals into high existential crises.",

            "Manhattan (1979) was an acclaimed, mature, B/W masterpiece enhanced by a George Gershwin score (performed by the New York Philharmonic conducted by Zubin Mehta), telling about infidelity, entangling romances and situations...",
            "The gorgeous black and white photography recalls the smoky images of a New York that existed perhaps only in portraits on a wall, but it also evokes the way its lead character, and by proxy Allen himself.",

            "As a slightly ironic comedy-romance (it's shot, beautifully, in black and white by cinematographer Gordon Willis and the background music is all Gershwin), the film is a success of classic proportions.",
            "Has self-flagellation ever been this elegant?",
            "Manhattan is one of the greatest films ever made, with a final passage that's truly devastating.",
            "In \"Manhattan,\" Allen has more to say about people, relationships, and human nature than he does in \"Annie Hall\" . . . but what he says, apart from a handful of hilarious lines, isn't as consistently funny.",
            "Manhattan is Allen's most fully realized film, especially in the way perspectives are developed. It's the rare movie that can be watched from a number of different points-of-view, without feeling cheated.",
            "Allen's cynicism rears its head in this movie quite a bit, and in many ways he pokes fun at his own audience, though I doubt his die-hard fans catch it."

            "What Benton achieved with his screenplay he intensified with his direction. Each performance is a minor miracle of perfection - not only Hoffman's and Streep's, which dominate the picture, but each of the supporting roles as well.",
            "Kramer vs. Kramer is greatly enriched by its exceptional cast.",
            "It's an interesting movie to look back on for its attitudes: In the guise of being a consciousness-raiser it plumps for male tenderness and demonizes the mother who can't recognize how far her workaholic ex-hubbie has come.",
            "One of the most mature, emotionally crushing, unforgettable dramas of the year - and of the decade.",

            "There is so seldom even one great performance in a movie that three is too much to expect. For that reason alone, this story of a couple battling for custody of their young son is a remarkable achievement.",

            "Kramer Vs. Kramer is a perceptive, touching, intelligent film about one of the raw sores of contemporary America, the dissolution of the family unit.",
            "Like a few other recent movies, it takes a serious look at problems faced in real people in real life -- family conflicts, personality problems, childrearing dilemmas.",
            "Benton's direction must first be praised for his choice of actors and his collaboration with them.",

            "the first part of the movie is essentially Marx in space, and the second part of the movie is Darwin in space.",
            "A horror masterpiece that doesn't age at all because its main theme is the fear of the unknown and that's one of the deepest fears. [Full review in Spanish]",

            "Here is a movie so fresh and funny it didn't even need a big budget or a pedigree.",

            "Although Apocalypse Now is not a great movie, it shows a still-impressive, politically inspired ambition -- a reminder of why film culture matters... Mixing pessimism with astonishment, it expanded cultural unease on a grand 70mm scale.",
            "The film holds together well enough until it reaches its final muddle, and it has scenes and moments unequaled in recent European or American movies.",
            "Coppola says he wanted to get to the moral issues that are behind all wars, but I think he has done no more than demonstrate the obvious-that in Vietnam we fought a bad war.",
            "as Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) heads up river to assassinate Kurtz, his increasing admiration for the man is offset by his disgust at the scenes of more authorised insanity (and hypocrisy) all around. ",
            "Good or bad, success or failure, this is a magnificent, gonzo piece of cinema, and the art form would be far lesser if it had never existed.",
            "An indelible statement on the lunacy of war.",

            "A great idea. But the movie that Albert Brooks has made from it, alas, gets most of its laughs in the first 10 minutes, slides into a long middle stretch of repetitive situations and ends on a note of embarrassing hysteria.",
            "While the fictitious Albert Brooks takes us cheerfully into his confidence, the Albert Brooks behind the camera sees through him with hilarious clarity.",
            "Mr. Brooks is at his most droll.",
            "Albert Brooks's first and funniest feature.",
            "...an intriguing (and impressively prescient) premise that's employed to exceedingly hit-and-miss effect by Brooks...",
            "Real Life is a jewel of American comedy and one of the first mockumentaries ever made.",
            "It's astonishing, and a bit sad really, how prescient Real Life is.",
            "The first of Brooks' analytical comedies is his funniest and most rigorous",
            "Albert Brooks is so deft at showing how filmmaking distorts the very reality it aims to record honestly that it's hard to watch family documentaries anymore without thinking about Real Life.",
            "Though amusing in spots, it goes too far with its one-note joke until it becomes abrasive.",
            "Brooks messes with the genre from the start, spouting pseudoscience about how the filmmakers found their test subjects (led by a spot-on Charles Grodin).",
            "Mock-umentary predates reality shows, still funny.",
            "Albert Brooks just before he became great.",
            "A great, underrated, lost gem of a film that accurately predicted and lampooned reality television long before it ever came to be.",
            "Real Life is funy in spots but is remarkable mostly for its Socratic open-endedness.",
            "Brooks's directorial debut is also one of his best movies, largely due to the funny man's trademark multitasking as writer, actor and helmer.",
            "There's a little bit of genuine prescience, inspiration, and intelligence coursing through its veins, but mostly that smattering of each just makes you crave more."

            "A fascinating character study, bittersweet and insightful yet full of tremendous laughs.",
