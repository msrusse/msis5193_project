            "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie",
            "Too much psychology and not enough pop. It's possible to be too serious, you know. ",
            "You will feel utterly numb after the screening of The Dark Knight. The film is bleak and brilliant.",
            "This is an impressive film in many ways, and Nolan directs with real confidence, yet the overall result feels cumbersome.",
            "Among the great strengths of The Dark Knight is the way it combines hardboiled naturalism with the kind of stunts and setpieces you expect in summer blockbusters.",
            "To talk of Heath Ledger's performance is difficult, merely because, as gigantic as it is, it is only one important feature of an intricately wrought canvas.",
            "The famous masked vigilante has never looked or felt more intense.",
            "With his smeared whiteface make-up and leering razor-slashed smile, Ledger's Joker is creepy enough to look at, but what he represents is even more chilling.",
            "The awards hype is warranted.",
            "The Dark Knight managed to capture something complex and instinctive about the \"war on terror\" era.",
            "A masterpiece. Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight is not only one of the greatest comic book movies you'll ever see, but also one of the best films of all-time.",
            "It seems almost cruel to take beloved child archetypes and turn them into projections for adult angst.",
            "Heath Ledger gives one of the best performances of the last twenty years. When you watch his take on the Joker, it's one of complete surprise and mystery. It's frightening with how chaotic and mischievous he makes him.",
            "Ledger's performance alone is good enough to make The Dark Knight a very good movie, but fortunately this is a film with even more than that -- making it the not just the best film of the summer, but one of the best films of the year.",
            "The Dark Knight represents a masterpiece in filmmaking as Christopher Nolan takes the Batman Begins sequel to an entirely new level.",
            " The definitive movie of its genre and the best Batman film to date",
            "Heath Ledger is great.",
            "Not just a perfect comic book movie, not just a perfect Batman movie, but darn-near a perfect movie, full stop.",
            "The movie's a real neo-noir all right, wallowing in darkness, thrilled with how bad we are, and getting such a kick out of our impending doom it cheers you right up.",
            "A film is only as good as its villain. By that standard, The Dark Knight achieves true greatness.",
            "The Dark Knight always ought to be played on the biggest screen possible, and played loud, like a Led Zepplin song. Director Christopher Nolans' skyscapes, the helicopter shots and views from the 200th floor, are IMAX at its best.",
            "It might not be the most fun superhero movie ever made, but it's certainly the most mature, complex and intriguing of them all. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "The Dark Knight may not supply a happy ending, but there is a feeling of exhilaration as Batman rides off from the pursuing cops, and the realization that this is another big step forward for comic book movies.",
            "The action sequences are like being injected with a shot of adrenalin straight into the heart."

            "Significantly better than the first film or, say, the first two Harry Potters.",
            "Adamson is probably indifferent to politics, which would be easier to forgive if the film gave you anything else to think about.",
            "Better stunts, superior use of slow-motion, and family-friendly violence aid in the project's smooth pace and sustained action.",

            "I can't comment on whether it does Narnia literature justice, but as a film fan, I can whole-heartedly recommend it as an example of fantasy done right. ",
            "It's a relatively entertaining romp, but it would be surprising if anyone is counting down the days until the third movie.",
            "Adamson seems to have decided the great battle at the end of the previous film was its best part and has set out to recapture it but more so, leading to some truly outstanding set pieces, but resulting in a film that is less than the sum of its parts.",
            "Some religious punters may find it to be a bastardization of their and Lewis' theological core values, while secularists will find the whole Narnia concept to be nothing more than a shrewd recruiting campaign for Christianity.",
            "Caspian is a visual sleeper hold from frame one; a constipated effort to erect widescreen wonderment, yet the production is missing dimension and needed narrative gusto.",
            "Darker, more complex and less prone to the cutesy wow-factor, this is a gripping tale with a thoughtful message.",
            "The body count is high, the running time is particularly long for a children's film, and the themes are fairly heavy. But, like Wardrobe, it's a lush and mostly entertaining production.",
            "Most of C.S. Lewis's peculiar magic is lost.",

            "The tone veers wildly from sentimental family drama to cartoonish fantasy, and some of the attempts at humor badly misfire.",

            "Chow loves his comedic exaggerations, and for good reason: he executes silly with dazzling skill. CJ7 might be a minutely less aggressive production from Chow, but that doesn't make it any less unreal or hilarious.",
            "This is a wildly inventive and funny film that is a breath of fresh air.",
            "Always intriguing but not always fully involving, CJ7 still features, as with its resurrecting dog, Chow's enlivening touch. Even when his film isn't completely absorbing, it seems he never met a dying genre clich\u00e9 he can't reanimate."

            "An edge-of-your-seat thriller that also manages to have a heart and soul.",
            "Portraying the effects of war both psychologically and physically, The Hurt Locker features amazingly beautiful direction and superb performances.",

            "I've had mosquito bites that were more passionate than this undead, unrequited, and altogether unfun pseudo-romantic riff on Romeo and Juliet.",
            "I watched Twilight in a cinema full of young girls who, when they weren't texting friends and guzzling soft drinks, giggled, sighed and exhaled with a passion that was not only endearing, but a measure of its emotional truth.",
            "A sometimes girlie swirl of obsession that will delight fans, this faithful adaptation is after teenage blood, and will most likely hit a box office artery.",
            "The fact that it's not completely appalling is perhaps its greatest achievement.",
            "It's critic proof.",
            "For hopeful adolescents and hopeless romantics alike, this bizarrely quaint love story (adapted from the first of a best-selling series of books by Stephenie Meyer) will play the heartstrings like a harp.",

            "Like most great psychological lessons in the hands of novices, this is a story far more interested in dancing to rhythms than understanding melody.",
            "The orthodox blood-drinking vampires...are about as frightening as snitty runway models, and are only there to threaten Bella's maidenly Type O so Edward can rescue her for the seven-hundredth time.",
            "Twilight is an earnest fantasy set on the cusp of adulthood, just as the way the light falls on everything in your life is changing. I don't blame anyone who wants to linger there for a moment. Even with sparkle vampires.",
            "Die-hard fans of the vampire romance novel Twilight will be happy to know that the film follows the book nearly to the letter. For everyone else, however, this isn't good news.",
            "In accordance with the adage about the rubbishy book making for the better movie, Twilight the film is great. ",
            "Without descending into camp, Pattinson undercuts earnest intensity with a deft, self-conscious wit. ",
            "The sequels became increasingly silly and overwrought but the original Twilight (2008) is actually kind of interesting even if you are not a devotee of the fan fic-turned-bestseller series.",
            "Stewart and Pattinson have convincing chemistry as the star-crossed lovers.",
            "You've been warned.",
            "Unless you're a 14-year-old girl who gets all giddy at the thought of cute boys and first love, steer clear of Thirteen director Catherine Hardwicke's anemic adaptation.",
            "Yes, it's strongly geared to the teen audience, but don't hold it against the filmmakers and go in with any preconceived notions and you'll find it a fun opening chapter of a new franchise.",
            "It's not the stunts and derring-do which excite the senses as much as the quiet chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson; that is guaranteed to get your blood up.",
            "Its built-in fanbase (thanks to the best-selling novel) is ready to swoon. I'm not one of those swooners but even I had a great time indulging in the earnest urgency."

            "Leatherheads shoots for the Frank Capra/Howard Hawks goal posts but instead winds up getting bogged down midfield.",
            "A 1920s football saga that blends rusty screwball comedy and perfunctory romance under a period piece veneer.",
            "It's good-looking, good-natured and sophisticated, but Leatherheads can't choose between football biopic or screwball romance.",
            "Attempts to reimagine a '30s diversion in comedy zaniness - but with only partial success.",
            "When Leatherheads focuses on the gridiron, it is slightly amusing and worth your time, but once it gets into a romantic triangle involving the three leads, Leatherheads feels like any other tired romantic comedy.",
            "The film looks great, and the production design is stunning, but the final product is overlong and tedious.",
            "The audience most likely to enjoy this film-fans of classic romantic comedies like It Happened One Night and His Girl Friday to which Leatherheads pays homage-are most likely to be put off by a smattering of obscenities. ",
            "Is Leatherheads a retro screwball comedy? A patriotic tribute? A sliver of sports history? It's all those things and more. Alas, more is not necessarily better.",
            "If the likes of His Girl Friday and Ball of Fire are the standards, Leatherheads can be forgiven for falling short.",
            "Leatherheads is too light-hearted to rise above its limitations, and its inability to decide on a tone doesn't help any, but it's too well crafted and thought out to be actually bad.",
            "Clooney stages screwball repartee like a ping-pong match shot through molasses",
            "Leatherheads tries to be a screwball comedy, but it's more The Eleven Stooges.",
            "Agreeable yet uneven...",
            "Mostly simply tries for fun, and for a good part of it, it delivers. But with it's jumble of elements, it doesn't allow a central one to take hold and truly fly.",
            "Leatherheads really doesn't know what kind of film it is, and as a result it shanks the winning kick -not by a mile- but by enough to be a disappointment.",
            "A gorgeous, charming, quaintly stylish movie comprised almost exclusively of moments and not so much story or characters.",
            "Therein lies the problem with Leatherheads %u2014 it has too many fish to fry, and most of them come out half-done.",
            "This is the slightest of Clooney's directorial offerings, but it's carried over the line by two charismatic leads and a well-honed screenplay.",

            "The tropes of the heartwarming indie kids movie get thrown together with the tropes of the low-voltage, war-at-home war drama, and the result is muddled but undeniably affecting",
            "In truth, the film is sure to stop the hearts of many who see it. There may indeed be hope in hell, but better to avoid hell altogether.",
            "Because its gaze is so level and so unyielding, it stands as one of the better dramatic films made on this subject (although it's not nearly as fine as Louis Malle's Au Revoir les Enfants, in which the camps remain a distant abstraction).",
            "At once painful, tear-jerking, and deeply emotional, this is a film that cannot be easily forgotten.",

            "A superb adaptation of John Boyne's novel bears witness to the unyielding horror of the Holocaust through the eyes of a child. ",
            "This intelligent film offers a fresh perspective on an oft-portrayed period, asking the viewer to question his own assumptions about what he expects and wants from such a telling.",
            "Not without its qualities, the movie ultimately does a disservice to the very people it purports to represent.",
            "A film dealing with the Holocaust really should be a little less clumsily executed, manipulative and contrived than this.",
            "Built upon a powerful but gimmicky end, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas would make a fine short. As a full-length feature, though, the pajamas wear thin quickly.",
            "This writer can't remember witnessing a harder-hitting kids' movie denouement than the one that closes this microcosm of middle-class German family life in WWII.",
            "Much of the film depends on our ability to suspend disbelief and see the world as Bruno sees it. It has a finale designed to shock.",
            "You may get halfway through and wonder why it's getting so heavily recommended here. Once you've experienced it in its entirety, you'll know why.",
            "For me, the pluses far outweighed any misgivings I had with this ultimately very moving film.",
            "The performances never falter, and even James Horner's heavy-handed score can't dim the film's unfathomable, unshakable ending.",
            "The story is passable, albeit a little too manufactured for my taste in terms of its moral lessons, but the execution is so stilted and unconvincing that the experience is uncomfortable",

            "Ice Cube is now Public Enemy Number Fun, although First Sunday is only fun if you're in dire need of a modernist urban take on the strain of comedy Abbott and Costello used to practice, which, let's be honest, wasn't that funny to begin with.",
            "The ending seems either a catering to studio influence or an effort to keep the film at a certain length as it falls short of Talbert's usual standard of writing. ",
            "First Sunday isn't an out and out bad film, but to be a good one it would need to either greatly raise the dramatic steaks, or push its comedic boundaries over the top in conception. Instead it treads water safely in the middle, and it shows.",
            "Perhaps moviegoers demand simplicity and cheap laughs more than ever during tough times, but this must be discouraging to aspiring African-American comedians and writers.",

            "The moral maze is not quite as murky as it should be, a suspicion that we may have misjudged the hero whisks the film back into the realms of fiction, and detracts from the issues it raises.",

            "Writer-director Jeffrey Nachmanoff bends over backwards to be even-handed, but his attempts at balance come over as earnestly unsubtle.",

            "Surprisingly, Steve Martin created this story. In a decade of wild and crazy fictional terrorism, his was the most horrifyingly plausible - one that spun terrorism as drama into uncomfortable community theater, striking the country's friendliest corners.",

            "Mr. Langella wisely decided not to impersonate the iconic president exactly, but he has captured Mr. Nixon perfectly nonetheless.",

            "The film's success ultimately depends on the byplay between Sheen and Langella, and they're more than up to the task. Langella, in fact, may have just delivered a performance for the ages -- and how often do those come along?",
            "The movie is essentially a chamber piece pivoting on two beautifully nuanced performances.",
            "It's a credit to the actor that by the end, Langella is living, it seems, in Nixon's skin.",
            "Howard has successfully made an okay, watchable movie, kept from greatness only by his undying artistic blandness.",
            "Frost/Nixon is smart and involving, a thoroughly grown-up and carefully made drama about the real-life, on-air showdown between a lightweight TV personality and a disgraced ex-president.",
            "Both leads are outstanding. Langella is especially mesmerizing as the calculating grand manipulator. It's not an impression of the former president, but a piece of his essence.",
            "Langella looks nothing like Nixon, but he has the jowls and, most of all, conveys the paranoia and ego that help us to understand what brought Nixon down.",
            "Frost/Nixon shouldn't be this entertaining. Or, at least, it shouldn't be entertaining enough to merit rapt attention for two hours. This is a film about an interview, after all. But it works. And it works remarkably well.",
            "Frost/Nixon crackles with excitement, humor and the thrill of the hunt -- and Langella and Sheen couldn't be better.",

            "For a while you go along for the ride. But as the film progresses it becomes increasingly unwieldy.",
            "Ritchie, who shoots and cuts everything in RocknRolla like an ad for a particularly greasy brand of fragrance for men, delivers the beatings and killings in his trademark atmosphere of morally weightless flash.",
            "Style is what RocknRolla is all about. And it has it in spades, from the cockney Pulp Fiction dialogue to the music-video editing of the rambling narrative.",
            "It's all perfectly serviceable, but still leaves us guessing over whether Ritchie is just a one-trick pony. ",
            "As ever with Ritchie, RocknRolla is more flash than substance, but beneath the swagger his movie scratches away at British anxieties.",
            "So this is Guy Ritchie's big comeback? Huh. ",
            "It's all about the set-up and not the actual payoff.",
            "RocknRolla is a return to form, of sorts, for Mr. Ritchie. ... The British director has returned to familiar territory, that of the small-time hood.",
            "An over-long mish-mash of scarcely linked sub-plots...",
            "'RocknRolla' takes more left turns than imaginable. It might make sense in the mind of Guy Ritchie, but to the rest of the universe, I can not imagine the film will translate.",
            "A self conscious re-working of Guy Ritchie's now familiar style and storyworld.",
            "It's long, confusing but is definitely saved with great performances and a tight episodic script...",
            "Breaks no new ground for movies or for Ritchie, but it is an amusing diversion and therefore a return to form. [Blu-ray]",
            "Some movies go off on tangents. This movie is nothing but tangents.",

            "Ritchie still has the knack for street-tough dialogue, and there's plenty of laughs amid the gunplay.",

            "It's an unfortunate end to a promising movie.",
            "Ultimately, it didn't move me in any way.",
            "Even if it occasionally goes off course, City of Ember provides audiences with a thought-provoking and family-friendly adventure.",
            "A thrilling adventure tale and teen fantasy that is grounded in real concerns about who is managing the planet.",
            "It's difficult not to become immersed in the fun of uncovering clues and discovering secrets in a society and landscape with few caps on creativity.",
            "Fans of Duprau's novel and those who've resonated with other Walden family films are likely to find much to like here.",
            "Worth checking out if you can forgive the flaws.",
            "The movie benefits from solid performances from Tim Robbins as Doon's dad and Martin Landau as Doon's elderly boss. The design teams successfully bring the city to life.",
            "A lot of thought and effort has been put into City of Ember but the whole is never more than the sum of its parts. It wants to be an adventure story and a fable and a mystery all at the same time and never quite decides what it is.",
            "One of the best family films of the year...if you like your kid movies with a little more bruising than normal.",
            "Built upon a bedrock of dazzling and richly constructed sets -- think Dr. Seuss meets Jules Verne meets Mad Max -- and complemented by rock-solid storytelling, it's an enormously enjoyable family film.",
            "Ultimately, this journey to rekindle the fire of humanity fails to burn bright enough, leaving only the unpleasant taste of ashes.",
            "A shaky platform of sense but the visual genius is so great, the film must be seen.",
            "In addition to being fascinating and exciting, City of Ember invites its young viewers to constantly ask questions and never give up.",
            "Tween audiences should be awestruck, and the message of audacity in the face of orthodoxy feels genuinely heroic.",
            "An extraordinary children's adventure...",
            "Although it starts slowly, there are plenty of rewards in this well crafted family fantasy adventure, as it explores a world in which light bulbs form the sky and a powerful generator acts as its heartbeat.",
            "This well-designed and executed piece of entertainment is actually very satisfying.",
            "Pure escapism fun, with plenty of stark visuals and inventiveness to go around.",
            "The best family movie you never heard of is waiting for you to discover it.",
            "This is a movie with a very specific target audience %u2013 young people who've read the book %u2013 and it will play solely to that demographic."

            "The movie respects its young audience, it has a keen appreciation for what it means to be a child in a troubled world, and it knows that there's plenty to be said for the optimism that comes with innocence.",

            "I'm all for a documentary about the mass hysteria of our warring creeds, but stand-up satirist Bill Maher turns out to be the wrong man to make it.",
            "Maher has gone for easy targets. He comes up with the odd funny gag, but you get the feeling that he is as dogmatic about his doubt as the believers are about their faith.",
            "It was much more thought-provoking than I was expecting, but his blatant bias made me feel that he was no less a fundamentalist than the religious people he was criticising.",
            "Over-extended but nonetheless thought provoking and humorous documentary.",
            "Maher crucifies the kooks. What he singularly fails to do, though, is engage with anyone sensible. By mocking the loonies he squanders the precious high ground. A real pity.",
            "It's a shame [Maher] hasn't tackled more intellectually formidable adversaries, and it's a shame that in going for easy laughs he's only preaching to the converted.",
            "It's disappointing given Maher's known comic potential and his regularly televised socio-political insights.",
            " \"Why can't we all just get along?\" [Maher] asks at one point. Maybe he should have turned that question back on himself.",
            "It's hugely amusing to see an argument so cheerfully loaded, so barefacedly one-sided, and so frankly determined to bully the other side into silence.",
            "As Bill Maher demolishes one soft target after another, his smugness wears thin.",
            "Bill Maher admittedly dresses a one-sided anti-religion diatribe in documentary linens and the hypocrites he finds make great punchlines. But he also addresses the historically proven truth of faith perverted for power and the danger posed to us all.",
            "Borat/Bruno meets Michael Moore in this funny and thought provoking attack on religion.",
            "So if you are not already on-side with [Maher's] particular leanings, the pickings in Religulous are very slim indeed.",

            "Instead of confronting real problems radiating from the world's major religions Mr. Maher and Mr. Charles opt for Borat redux, making fun of silly little yokels.",
            "Ever the clever quipper, Bill Maher tackles religious dogma and ritual%u2013and Bibles tales%u2013in this documentary of irreverence. The film is witty and pointedly critical%u2013but it's no revelation.",

            "At just over two hours, the film naturally feels a bit cramped and the most interesting elements are given fairly short shrift.",
            "In the end, however, this is a film which though less ambitious than Atonement is very much the equal of The Duchess. Its weakness is the same as that of the latter: it has no guiding hand prepared to take risks and make it distinctive.",
            "A miscast Emma Thompson in a white wig is the story's steely enforcer of Catholic orthodoxy... She's such a monster that the film comes perilously close to turning into an Invasion of the Soul Snatchers.",

            "[Nanni] Moretti makes this 'study' in despair a naggingly neutral, at times borderline coy experience.",
            "Grief has rarely felt quite so empty as it does in Quiet Chaos.",
            "Moretti gives his usual excellent performance. But the script throws in too many other elements while it should be concentrating on the father-daughter relationship.",
            "The film, while uneven -- sometimes too on the nose, sometimes anecdotal and diffuse -- is generally absorbing, thanks mostly to the quality of the acting.",
            "Not even the momentary participation extraordinaire of a vertically challenged famous filmmaker self-exiled from the United States can save this phony pseudo-drama from its final collapse into a heap of inconsequence and male vanity.",
            "Touching and sentimental in equal measure, Quiet Chaos exhibits many traits that fans will recognise from Moretti's own films as director, such as Caro Diario (1993) and The Son's Room (2001).",
            "Perceptive and moving.",
            "There are moments of truth in \"Quiet Chaos,\" such as when Pietro resorts to recreational drugs and rough sex, but those moments are far too few and much too far between.",
            "Quiet Chaos jerkily shifts tones, from oddly comic ... to blunt. And by blunt I mean an indiscreet, in-your-face sex scene that turns the viewer from observer to pervy voyeur.",
            "Grimaldi's sensitive direction, allied to a subtle score by Paolo Buonvino, sharp script and accomplished acting, helps to turn this into an original and complex study of the unpredictability of human foibles and weaknesses.",
            "Quiet Chaos has strength and insight about the experiences that cause us to change direction in life.",
            "Some of the plot is implausible, yet the core ideas resonate richly, and the characters' behaviour is psychologically intriguing.",
            "[Moretti delivers] a complex and complete performance...",
            "A respectable and always watchable film about bereavement, well acted and well made.",
            "It's subtle stuff with an appealing lack of contrivance and there is something very natural about its resolution.",
            "It's like a psychological study, but performed with grace and humanity",
            "Quiet Chaos is an apt description for the emotional state of Nanni Moretti's grieving widower Pietro, in a film whose central theme is grief, but that plays out with a mix of humour and acceptance",
            "Moretti's imposing frame and presence form the heart of this unexpected tale about love, relationships and loss.",
            "Don't expect anything too profound from this middleweight fare - but it'll still be better than the inevitable remake.",
            "A thoughtful portrait of the purgatory of grief that prefers small incidences and exchanges over grand gestures of sentiment and revelation. It's sad - but never cloying.",
            "The boldest stroke in Nanni Moretti's Quiet Chaos is in what it doesn't do, rather than what it does."

            "It is a flawed movie, vastly overwritten, with characters pointing things out that we've long worked out for ourselves. Still, the self-referentiality of Eastwood's performance ensures that Gran Torino isn't just absorbing, but also moving.",
            "Seeing Eastwood ward off young gangsters was odd... well, but he pulled it off enough.",
            "Though the film feels like a requiem, Kowalski's heart is still defiantly beating.",

            "As a film, Gran Torino is powerful, moving and entertaining; as a tribute to a living legend, it's deeply, indelibly affecting.",

            "It is rumored this could be the 78-year-old's final film performance. If that is the case, Eastwood goes out on top - creating one of his most memorable characters in his rather impressive acting resume.",
            "[The] twist... elevates Gran Torino far above the typical vengeance-wreaking flick.",
            "...\"Gran Torino\" contains within its strangely tight wanderings the utter, dexterous precision of drama-comedy and tragedy-given not to intellect and consideration, but to profound conviction and feeling.",
            "Aside from the somewhat dubious pleasure of Eastwood's tuneful noodlings, Gran Torino is not a very good film.",
            "[Its] problems cannot be ignored.",
            "This is another Eastwood's deconstruction of his career, and it doesn't give anything else in the movie any room to breathe. ",

            "A stunning piece of work that feels both familiar and completely unique at the same time.",
            "After I saw Il Divo, I suppose I should have felt indignation. I suppose I should also have felt that way after \"The Godfather.\" But such films present such mesmerizing figures that I simply regard them, astonished.",
            "The enigmatic Andreotti is the perfect subject for a biopic in the European tradition.",
            "All in all, this phenomenal film illustrates Alexis de Tocqueville's observation that \"The people get the government they deserve.\" In both meanings of the word, Il Divo is sensational.",
            "A more conventional filmmaker would be defeated by Andreotti's murky history, but Sorrentino's flamboyantly Baroque approach - full of dazzling visual flourishes worthy of Scorsese in his pomp - delivers an indelible portrait. ",
            "Sumptuous filmmaking at its most flashiest, \"Il Divo\" may distance some people but I found it to be riveting.",
            "A clever telling of the story about the epic levels of corruption in Italian public life that found the suitably opaque, vampiric presence of Andreotti at the centre of it.",
            "A fascinating history of recent Italian politics.",
            "... not so much a savage satire as one disenchanted with the institutional corruption of politics.",
            "... Sorrentino avoids the dreary conventions of the biopic in favor of a cheeky mix of music montages, dramatic re-enactments and hilariously deadpan takes ....",
            "Combining clammy skin, busy hands, and a posture reminiscent of Snoopy in his vulture phase, [Servillo] (re-)creates a fascinating monster ... Given some CliffsNotes, the surrounding film might even be worthy of him.",
            "Inventive and fun... Toni Servillo gives a truly exquisite performance, easily the finest seen on U.S. screens in 2009 thus far.",
            "This is a spectacular film about corruption in high places, specifically as that relates to the political life of Giulio Andreotti, seven times prime minister of Italy and a senator for life.",
            "Servillo does such a good job of suggesting the drive and intelligence of the man that he automatically becomes one of the great recent cinematic symbols of absolute political power and the questionable means utilized in order to achieve it.",
            "Even with no knowledge of Italian government, you can enjoy this hip, un-stodgy, grimly entertaining dissection of it.",
            "You may not leave the theater with a firmer grasp of Italian politics, but you will leave with an appreciation of some outstanding filmmaking.",
            "There is sufficient power in the imagery and performances to make Il Divo worth hacking through.",
            "Il Divo joins Matteo Garrone's more expansive, more extraordinary Gomorrah -- which contains an even better performance from Servillo -- as a grim portrait of the trouble with modern Italy.",

            "Should you go into this movie with no knowledge of this slice of history, you'll not only learn something, but you'll be so entertained you may find yourself laughing out loud (when you're not shaking your head).",
            "A must-see for political junkies of any nationality.",

            "Writer director Carlos Cuar\u00f3n (brother of Alfonso) has created characters that are so real you can almost hear their thoughts. Tato and Beto are filled with contradictions, faults, quirks and foibles, yet we like them and want them to succeed",

            "Not as obviously delightful as Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n, Rudo y Cursi is never less than enjoyable, helped by charismatic playing between two stars constantly calling each other \"pendejo\" and some gorgeous camera work from Adam Kimmel.",
            "It scores high on clich\u00e9s but makes up for it with lots of fizzing energy and lively turns. Indeed it's more screwball than football.",
            "Cuar\u00f3n's spirited footie fable is a game of two halves, buzzing with balls, bimbos and black comedy, but ultimately unable to bring home the trophy. Bernal gets man of the match, no contest."

            "Castle/the Punisher is not the most charismatic comic book hero at the best of times but Stevenson's jowly pallor and oil slick of hair makes him look more like an Eastern European abattoir worker than a vigilante to be reckoned with.",

            "The final damning verdict left by the American box office, whom far from raced out to see it, meaning takings of 8m leave Punisher: War Zone the lowest grossing Marvel adaptation to date.",

            "It's impressive that a filmmaker of Lee's distinction is willing to continue to push boundaries.",
            "Clocking in at 160 minutes, this interminable movie comes across like a rough cut. Perhaps Lee believed its length would give it gravitas. The opposite is true.",

            "Miracle makes a bid for epic status, but Lee throws in more elements - including murder mystery and supernatural fantasy - than the narrative can stand. The two big battle scenes are impressively staged, but the action in between sprawls and stumbles.",
            "Takes too long to get to its one moving moment at the end.",

            "As a theoretical corrective, it's salutary; as a movie, it's a frickin' blooper",
            "The agenda is obvious, but the rage feels justified, and meanwhile Lee gives us a few virtuoso touches.",

            "The poor woman [Hunt] deserves a better movie.",
            "Trying to establish a serio-comic tone is a task best suited for seasoned directors. Given that a boom microphone drops into the film frame at least twice, Hunt has more basic production elements to master.",
            "The loudest laughs in this \"serious comedy\" came from three brief appearances by author Salman Rushdie as a doctor.",
            "Given its cast and source material - Elinor Lipman's highly-regarded novel - it all makes for a highly disappointing experience.",

            "All in all, not quite as good as it gets.",

            "Hunt's film does soften the heart, not least because of its honesty and its sensitivity to some unfashionable dilemmas.",
            "There's food for thought in the pregnancy plot, although the narrative drags its heels towards a misty-eyed conclusion.",
            "A bittersweet combination of comedy and drama, this sensitive film has enough strong material in it to make it worth seeing, even if it sometimes feels under-developed and a little too heart-tugging",

            "...a decidedly minor addition to the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of Australian director Gillian Armstrong...The film moves quickly enough, and it's a passably glossy entertainment, but, as Houdini, Pearce is too young...",

            "( ... ) Summer Hours is Assayas's best film set on home turf-the one that best puts things in perspective and loudly proclaims that one must know how to shed dead skin to go on living.",
            "Assayas' script is more allusive than demonstrative, with a distinct whiff of Eric Rohmer in its conversational blocks separated by fadeouts.",
            "n Summer Hours, Olivier Assayas's gently provocative rumination on family and possessions, a trio of siblings wrestles with the problem of what to do with the old homestead once Mother is gone.",
            "Evocative look at a family trying to decide what to do with its treasures.",
            "Where a Hollywood film of a family feuding over a fabulous estate would surely end with a slapped face and an infantry charge of lawyers, Assayas's work concludes with a smile and a shrug. Life goes on. What else can it do?",
            "Performances in this small and profoundly eloquent film are superb, yet none redirects attention from Assayas's earnest meditation on the ravaging effects of a shrinking world on family traditions and entrenched personal relationships.",
            "A profound and affecting film that is both inspiring and unforgettable.",
            "I love films which capture that atmosphere of late summer, lazy and sultry and shadowed by the coming autumn. So I found this very moving.",
            "In crafting his own objet d'art, Assayas has paid careful consideration to the fine aesthetic practiced in Taiwan, particularly that of Hou Hsiao-hsie.",
            "Avoiding easy conflict and histrionics, Summer Hours instead shows loving siblings, relatives and friends negotiating differences the best that they can. ",
            "Olivier Assayas's new meditation on French domestic life, the wisely ironic Summer Hours, begins with children's games and ends with adolescent partying and pairing off -- that is, the real business of life",
            "Has the feel, if not the look, of an old man's film, a meditation on the passing of time.",
            "...leisurely paced but intensely gripping film - which doesn't lend itself to facile capsulization - follows three generations of a French family as they prepare for the imminent death of their matriarch",
            "manages a sense of genuine poignancy that never becomes sticky or sentimental",
            "The film resonates with emotions as authentic as the details. ... And it asks us to ponder what makes the objects in our lives meaningful. ",
            "The film and its characters are smart, sincere and fully alive in ways we rarely have the opportunity to see.",
            "... an impressionist work with a wise understanding of human nature and a bittersweet portrait of a family going separate ways...",
            "The [movie's] concern might feel a little old-fashioned ... but in this film it's reasonably, solemnly, and levelheadedly expressed.",
            "A subtle, flawlessly acted, keenly observed family drama and poignant meditation on memory, identity, and history in the age of postmodernism and globalization.",
            "A well-constructed film about the end of a life and uncertainty about the future.",
            "Surprisingly wonderful, as if Assayas finally found a space in which to stretch out.",
            "The sheer banality of the proceedings -- appraisals! attorneys! -- threatens to rob those few poignant moments of their own dramatic value."

            "Though there are some powerful performances, notably those of Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-Fat, and some sweeping visuals, the movie feels melodramatic and overheated.",
            "Very pretty but very stiffly written, The Children of Huang Shi strives for epic canvases relaying an intimate story.",
            "If you can get past the Eurocentric focus, there are worse ways to pass the time than to see The Children of Huang Shi, if only because the glimpse into the time and place are captivating and the images are gorgeous.",

            "The ability to mount staggering epics that seize both the heart and the head has apparently become a lost art in the 21st century.",
            "A disappointingly detached and tame film for such a subject matter.",
            "...the film falls flat under the weight of its period-drama conventions and three performances that epitomize paycheck joylessness.",
            "Cynicism for another true story of a reckless white adventurer finding redemption and purpose helping 3rd World unfortunates evaporates with stunning and moving WWII scenes.",
            "The real test of endurance is on the shoulders of an audience challenged to sit through more than two hours of predictable plot turns and recycled sentimentality.",
            "Nothing in this film is subtle or unexpected, and even the hero's several near-death experiences create no real tension",
            "...an inspiring tale of a man answering a call to greatness even if he doesn't fully understand why it's fallen to him.",
            "Xiaoding Zhao's cinematography is splendid, Roger Spottiswoode's direction is workmanlike.",
            "It is missing conviction.",
            "Its anti-cynical faith in the value of altruism is encouraging.",
            "History is never easy to capture in a fiction film, especially with a war in the background. But you have to at least try to embrace the whole of it, not just tear off a convenient chunk. Real life is inconvenient; great movies still deal with it."

            "Despite some occasionally sloppy filmmaking, I think the picture is worth a look. It raises important ideas and issues, asks important questions. No one could argue against that, right? Bueller...Bueller...Bueller...",
            "Like Moore, whose documentary-cum-polemical style they are clearly imitating, the makers of Expelled give their critics too much ammunition, so even if you're sympathetic to some of the ideas and the underlying argument, it is still difficult to defend.",

            "The movie is unpersuasive, but it's amusing...",

            "Regardless of your personal views, Expelled's heavy-handed bias (a visit to Darwin's home gets the same eerie music as a tour of Dachau) is exasperating.",
            "Junk science meets even junkier filmmaking in Expelled -- a no more shameless, stupid and loathsome piece of propaganda has ever skulked its way into the theater.",
            "works in much the same way as a Michael Moore documentary -- a raft of provocation and very little persuasion",
            "I don't say the film is crap because I disagree with it. I say it's crap because it disagrees with itself. It teems with contradictions, false dichotomies, and specious reasoning.",
            "Manages to be flippant and darkly provocative at once.",

            "Knowing ... that it's a 20-year old story, one can only conclude the idea behind the film would have been best left unfilmed, an unfinished step toward greater things.",
            "Babel director shows his hand too soon",
            "A melancholy but also profoundly uplifting film by the talented Guillermo Arriaga. Storytelling is an artform and Arriaga is a master",

            "Even if the film is a little contrived, it's quite a haunting experience...",
            "Once it all clicks into place and viewers are left to engage with the characters, the heavy misery and self-importance of the piece becomes overwhelming.",

            "Instead of shades of ambiguity or a structure that quivers upon impact, Sam de Jong, the writer and director of \"Prince,\" depicts a universe in absolute terms. Ayoub's arc from good boy to bad prince is too rapid and uncomplicated.",
            "De Jong indulges in some shocking, violent imagery in these passages, and this detracts from the film's effective social portrait; so too does the aggressively loud synth-pop soundtrack.",
            "At its narrative apex, Prince veers toward expected tragedy and then unexpectedly crumbles, both stylistically and thematically.",

            "Like so many coming-of-age debuts before it, Prince isn't world-changing, but like the best of them, there's enough youthful electricity to De Jong's work to make you want to see what he does next.",
            "It wants to be cute, it wants to cool, and it also wants to be thoughtful and engaging, but Sam de Jong is unable to make the story feel tight and focused enough to allow it to succeed on all those levels. ",
            "Prince may be a little heavy on the style, but it is a contemporary style that lights up the story with energy.",
            "Prince could use another 15 minutes to flesh out its narrative and its relationships -- what movie couldn't? -- but it uses its time wisely and with an enormous efficacy only matched in size by the film's heart.",
            "The dialogue is stylized, part hip-hop, part American Western, and many compositions are studies in landscapes that are cool and resistant to the figures within. ",
            "With pieces of its plot not deepened or stretched out far enough and tidily assuming their predictable spots in the finale, Prince oftentimes proceeds like a parade of tropes.",
            "Expertly paced and gorgeous to behold, Sam de Jong's Dutch-language directorial debut sets a stylish coming-of-age story in a bleak Amsterdam housing project.",
            "Its stylistic brio makes Prince enough of a live wire to bode well for de Jong's future.",
            "This uneven but sweet bildungsroman is distinguished by its light tone and idiosyncratic handle on genre conventions.",
            "It revives hope for a pop-art cinema that's capable of treating characters like actual human beings rather than pawns on a chess board."

            "Frustratingly, there is potential in Watkins' claustrophobic, back-to-nature setting, but, in trying to play 'edgy' with contemporary anxieties, his cooked-to-formula script merely sinks to the level of the gutter press exploiting those fears.",

            "The Wackness, while no masterpiece, is the kind of film that doesn't come to much but is watchable as it saunters along with a provoking sense of meaningful pessimism. The performances are really the thing - Levine hasn't managed anything better.",
            "The direction is unlikeably murky and unfocused but this is more dope than wack - and a guaranteed four-star movie if you're already stoned yourself.",
            "The film's forlorn charm is a little reminiscent of Cameron Crowe's adolescent memoir Almost Famous. It's a tiny bit soppy, too, but you can forgive that in a teenager.",
            "Levine's film is often showy, clumsy, over-earnest. But then so are its characters. So is late adolescence. The Wackness carries out the advice Squires gives to Luke - make a mess, embrace pain. In doing so, it ends up anything but wack.",
            "The film's subtle shifts in tone and intent are handled brilliantly by Josh Peck, who plays a troubled teen drug dealer with the damaged bravado and raw honesty of a young De Niro.",

            "As unoriginal and clich\u00e9-ridden as Levine's screenplay is, he has taken care in developing some genuinely attractive off the wall characters",
            "Fortunately Peck's diamond acting pulls the film above its murky setting. It takes some courage to be this vulnerable on screen, and Peck is uncommonly good at it.",
            "An exercise in style and wit, two commodities that never go out of fashion.",
            "Josh Peck and Ben Kingsley make for an oddly engaging couple in Jonathan Levine's audacious comedy about sex, drugs, and unexpected friendships.",
            "It's an utterly routine picture, but its low-key mood and acting disarm",
            "With a game cast and cool songs from the era... heartfelt moments battling clumsy ones, The Wackness isn't quite dope but, like a good mixtape it is full of highlights.",

            "This is a gently humorous and beautifully moving film.",
            "Levine's extended use of sepia-toned cinematography adds to the film's charmless look, matching the bleakness of the lives of most of the people he presents to the audience.",
            "The performances are all very fine, but the standout is Ben Kingsley's Squires. It's so unexpected.",

            "This is a spy comedy which seems entirely unaware of the new genre of Jack Bauer or Jason Bourne, and instead looks more like a Roger Moore-era 007 knockoff.",
            "Admirably mimics the blend of genres and innovations that made the original series so memorable.",
            "While Carell hasn't quite attained an acting range that allows for much depth in his characters, the presence of Hathaway provides a perfect contrast to Maxwell Smart. ",
            "Get Smart's globe-trotting plot is as forgettable as the wrapper you shuck to get to the candy bar.",
            "Get Smart doesn't have a lot of laugh out loud moments, but it does have plenty of chuckles, which is just enough to make it miles better than the other new comedy.",
            "There are a few funny moments, mostly courtesy of Carell's natural charm and some surprising cameos that inject some much-needed life into an otherwise generic film.",
            "There are a few laughs, but nothing memorable, no biting satire and no clever wit. Most disappointing, there's no real chemistry between the bumbling Maxwell Smart and beautiful Agent 99. A fizzle where there be sizzle.",
            "There's a bit of tonal problem with this bundled blockbuster.",
            "The movie is hurt more than helped by having to carry over character names and shoehorn in the show's greatest hits, Carell and Hathaway's rhythm faltering with every recycled catchphrase.",
            "In a year where even Ghost Rider gets a sequel, Get Smart makes you actually want one.",
            "For anyone who entertained hopes for Get Smart and has not been entertained back, the film's main fault will lie in its wobbly translation.",
            "Get Smart certainly has its moments, but suffers badly from an inability to balance the surreal humor and life-threatening terrorist threat.",
            "There's enough packed in there to warrant a viewing if you fancy a bit of fun.",
            "Get Smart is a nice afternoon diversion. There are no big laughs to be had, no matter how hard it tries, but there are lots and lots of chuckles, and that's probably good enough.",
            "The hostile repartee between the characters is as ungainly as director Peter Segal's lumbering action sequences",
            "It has at least five undeniable laughs.",
            "While I think ultimately this film is unnecessary, it's still fairly entertaining and it's certainly better than the recent Pink Panther reboot with Steve Martin.",
            "The term laugh-a-minute is a bit hackneyed for my taste, and Get Smart comes closer to several laughs-a-minute."

            "Emily Mortimer is impressive as a jittery, unlikable attorney whose impulsive actions trigger Mike's descent. But it's Ejiofor's film all the way.",
            "Ejiofor remains a supremely assured, charismatic presence, though he has his work cut out here. He is pitted against a film with a black belt in pomposity and a gold medal in preening self-regard.",
            "The discipline is remarkable. But this constipated drama, set in a blue-collar corner of Los Angeles, imparts none of the sweat-shop magic.",
            "The plotting is contrived, the supporting characters two-dimensional, and the ending slides from predictable to absurd to maudlin.",
            "The first third of the film is a confusing mess of character introductions and details that are seemingly trivial and unrelated.",
            "What doesn't disappoint is Redbelt's satisfying retro flavor, a sense of pervasive corruption that immediately conjures up classic films noir.",
            "While I won't go to the mat and rave about this film, I will say that despite an often lack of balance and the distracting \"holes\" in the story, what propels this film is the characters driving it with performances that are worthy of a blackbelt.",
            "It's worth watching for the myriad of intriguing characters' performances, and to witness what happens when cynic Mamet goes Bruce Lee on us.",
            "With Ejiofor standing above the rest, the performances are uniformly excellent.",
            "It's about a contest between intelligence strength, leveraged by sleight of hand. The fight is fixed. So is the movie. Deal with it.",
            "It's a bit disappointing that Redbelt doesn't go much beyond a redux of the same-old.",
            "It's always fun to watch the Mamet stock company springing a trap on an unwary victim.",
            "What threatened to be David Mamet's most vainglorious misfire since perpetually casting his wife instead turned into samurai noir -an eloquently profane, profanely eloquent eulogy for the purity of martial arts discipline in the face of profit.",
            "A Kickboxer installment that got too big for its breeches",
            "Redbelt seems like a rush job that relies too much on the quick fix. I'm very willing to suspend my disbelief, but Redbelt becomes outlandish.",
            "This Mametian thriller is worth watching for a terrific performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor, but it's hard to engage with the story and it loses its way in the final act.",

            "It's hard to say what this solid but unadventurous film adds to Coetzee's powerful source material.",
            "A worthwhile film which is concerned to do the right thing by a modern classic.",
            "It's a faithful adaptation, but one that's been indifferently shot by director Steve Jacobs, whose blunt technique tends to flatten the book's morose charge. Still, the acting is often excellent.",

            "If you know the novel, you're likely to feel that something has been lost here; if you don't, you still have the film's monotonous pacing to contend with. Still, Jacobs has directed an intelligent, intriguing drama.",
            "This chilly film gets surprisingly close to the tone of Coetzee's precise prose.",
            "A perfectly cast John Malkovich gives a superb performance in a powerful and intelligent study of a man coming back from the brink.",

            "The screen version does not disappoint and features an outstanding performance from John Malkovich.",
            "So packed with big issues that it sometimes feels like a bit too much. But it's provocative and fascinating, and never offers any easy answers.",
            "Engaging, powerful and absorbing drama that doesn't offer any easy answers but exerts a tight grip, thanks to a terrific performance by John Malkovich.",
            "More convincing as an allegory, but faithful to Coetzee's acerbic, alternative view of S. Africa's future than the usual uplifting themes of reconciliation and forgiveness.",

            "For a film about discovering your own journey, it sure sticks to the main roads.",

            "When you've got three of the nation's best actresses in leading roles, it doesn't matter if your script is only adequate and the audience really has to squint here and there to believe what's happening on the screen.",
            "The trio's chemistry carries the film far.",
            "The story just doesn't do enough to pull the heartstrings.",
            "Unfortunately, it's as flimsy as tissue, and the actresses, all 50+, really do more with the material...than it deserves.",
            "While the premise of this roadtrip come buddy movie may be based on loss, the journey we take is a vibrant one",
            "What happens when you take 3 of the best dramatic actresses of all time and put them together in a road movie? Pretty much a movie that should have wound up on Lifetime.",
            "Bonneville gets by - barely - on the strength of its three leading ladies.",
            "Clearly, this fatiguing femme drama is Lifetime, Oxygen or straight-to-DVD grade level. To put it in theatres is a gross overreach.",
            "The characters, situations and resolutions all are predictable and fit like a warm, stretched-out sweater with holes in the elbows.",
            "... to see all that potential wasted on what's little more than a washed-out, milquetoast road trip comedy for the soon-to-be senior set is just a travesty.",

            "A heartfelt drama about a grieving woman who embarks with her two best friends on a pilgrimage across the West seeking meaning and closure.",
            "... sticks to a soothingly familiar itinerary, providing a welcome showcase for Jessica Lang, Kathy Bates and Joan Allen. As expected, they prove mighty good company along the way %u2014 which is fortunate, because there's nothing much else that qualifies",
            "It's a shame that it's such predictable pablum, full of easy lessons and obvious sentiment. The prodigiously talented Allen, Bates and Lange give it their all, but there's a limit to what even they can do with platitudes and prefabricated homilies.",
            "It's just great to see these three in sizable roles instead of being stuck in Hollywood movies where they pop up briefly to wash the dishes and dispense advice to the hot actress who's the star of the thing.",
            "There are zero surprises in the road comedy Bonneville, sadly including the fact that three middle-age actresses with three Oscars and nine nominations among them couldn't find anything more challenging to do.",
            "There's no avoiding the fact that Christopher Rowley's feature debut is as uninspired and predictable as your average Lifetime movie.",
            "Bonneville is so bland and predictable, it literally takes two Oscar-winners and a multiple nominee to give it any real entertainment value.",
            "Yes, the film deals with women of an age who are usually ignored in film, and it further deals with questions of mortality and loss, which are equally overlooked. The problem is, it doesn't deal with them very well."

            "Often witty and filled to the brim with exciting choreography.",

            "The simple construct yields such a rich world is a triumph, thanks in no small part to director Kelly Reichardt's hawk-like narrative focus and good casting sense.",
            "Wendy and Lucy is an old-school indie portrait of a woman in a desperate situation. It's quiet -- virtually silent in parts -- and at just 80 minutes, it makes its point without overstating it.",

            "Coming from any other filmmaker, Wendy and Lucy's relatively clear-eyed and unsentimental tale of woe might be considered a minor triumph, but from one of Reichardt's unique talents, it is something of a letdown.",
            "Beautifully painful.",

            "A wholly engaging partial misfire, if that makes sense -- a spare yet stylish marginal recommendation that connects due to its provocative premise and ruminations on violence, and the considerations that spawns.",
            "A grubby, disturbing serial-killer mystery, a kind of blood-simple Rashomon.",
            "Surveillance is a crafty crime film with an involving setup and a ridiculous payoff, but there's enough here to make it worth a viewing at least on DVD or cable.",
            "The most enjoyable way to watch Surveillance -- 'enjoyable' in the relative sense -- is to take its awfulness for granted and pay attention to everything Bill Pullman does.",
            "Falls somewhere in between the somewhat tongue-in-cheek tone of Wild at Heart and the more au courant trend toward savage, nihilistic deranged-killer movies."

            "A modern fable which draws broad parallels and depicts profound moral quandaries with an elegance and frankness rare in cinema. ",
            "It's a slow-burning Austrian thriller with no stars, no special effects and, by the looks of it, almost no budget. But sometimes a little goes a long way.",

            "This riveting study of desire, isolation, guilt and redemption bears the influence of both Robert Bresson and Michael Haneke, and proves surprisingly optimistic in its assessment of human weakness.",

            "Distractingly jumping back and forth in time, the film falters badly in the modern era, yet its tale is still a moving one.",
            "Nostalgic, deeply felt, and refreshingly astute, \"Fugitive Pieces\" is something of a rare bird these days%u2014a big-budget, transnational historical drama that actually justifies its scope and subject matter with more than visual opulence.",
            "Plays out with such daunting high-mindedness it makes The Reader look like Transformers.",
            "Fugitive Pieces reduces the Holocaust and its aftermath to a cosy soap opera.",
            "One of the most delicate, approachable and rewarding Holocaust movies of recent years.",
            "The movie has little dramatic momentum, and its journey is essentially Jakob's incremental acceptance of his fate. But Dillane and the writer-director Jeremy Podeswa create such a compelling central character that it hardly matters.",
            "Fugitive Pieces is all about glorifying a state of humorless suspension, where you dwell stoically in the past until, suddenly, you are rescued by a demure, unchallenging version of romantic love. It's depressing.",
            "Podeswa's confusing, commonplace film lumbers along with a painful sincerity.",
            "Given the source novel, Podeswa's attempt to adapt Fugitive Pieces is admirable in itself. Yet despite an enthusiastic cast, this fails to transport you in the same way. Tying itself in narrative knots, the end result is stilted.",
            "An intermittently powerful, if not entirely successful, piece.",
            "But while there's life, there's hope, and Jeremy Podeswa's delicate, deliberate adaptation of Anne Michaels' novel follows Jakob's heartrending progress from the darkness to the light.",
            "Restrained, worthy and dull.",
            "His journey towards peace of mind involves lots of lyrical philosophising, which presumably comes straight from the film's source novel, by Anne Michaels, and doesn't lend itself to dramatisation, despite Dillane's typically intelligent performance.",
            "Anne Michael's complex, poetic novel is here adapted into a stolid, somewhat po-faced film, but one that still manages to tease some affecting drama out of its scholarly premise.",
            "Despite a rich premise, the soul-searching of the older Jakob is, at best, curiously colourless; at worst, positively grating.",
            "There are fleeting moments of poignancy and poetry, significantly when the script features narration taken almost directly from the novel, but this is clunkily written and poorly edited.",
            "Jeremy Podeswa's tremulous adaptation of Anne Michaels's novel aches with earnest intent and tasteful eroticism, yet it moves as heavily and lugubriously as a prison gate.",
            "A slow-moving, fitfully atmospheric drama.",
            "Engaging, well acted and ultimately moving drama.",

            "Far from another Jumanji, any magic director Shankman tries to inject is squashed by Sandler's distressingly annoying turn, while Russell Brand and Keri Russell look uncomfortably crowbarred in.",
            "It descends into pathos, undermined by an insipid romantic subplot and the usual platitudinous guff about self-belief.",
            "It's a pleasing concept, and Sandler is at his least obnoxious, but surely Adam Shankman's family comedy could have been wittier.",
            "There's a surface liveliness to the movie, but it has that plasticky Disney quality and lack of real heart.",
            "In Bedtime Stories Adam Sandler gives his most bearable performance yet.",

            "There's nothing fresh in Sandler's role that you haven't seen in almost every movie he's ever done -- the same mumbly, underachiever-schlub notes he's been hitting for years, only taken down a notch for his first PG-rated comedy.",
            "A family-friendly Adam Sandler movie that, even with its strained plot developments, is tame without being lame.",
            "If you are forced to attend, then at least Bedtime Stories is tolerable, and occasionally fun -- when it forgets to be dumb.",
            "...ultimately comes off as the most entertaining Adam Sandler comedy to hit theaters since 2004's 50 First Dates...",
            "Enjoyable, silly and a wee bit whimsical. It's also treacherously predictable at times, the two leads lack chemistry and it has the token horrible Rob Schneider cameo.",
            "The real charm of Bedtime Stories is how it works as a family film.",
            "Given that Sandler's main appeal has always been to the 12-year-old in all of us, it probably makes sense for him to aim his movies directly at that age group.",

            "The ideas and some of the individual bits in Zohan work, but the crudeness of the execution undermines the results.",
            "The worst thing about the film is not that but the constant, feeble sexual innuendos with which Sandler saddles himself.",
            "It helps that this is Sandler's least irritating comedy role: instead of being a whiny misfit, he's a local hero who becomes a fish out of water - Crocodile Dundee with a bouffant mullet.",
            "Images of a thrusting male pelvis haunt the sensitive critic yet.",
            "But it's Sandler who is pivotal to its amiable success. Less precious, less power-tripping than the likes of Ben Stiller, Jim Carrey or Mike Myers, he never looks down on his material. He makes us laugh by willpower as much as technique.",
            "This is a silly, crass comedy about a badass Israeli commando who secretly longs to be a hairdresser specialising in 1980s stylings.",
            "The laughs ring hollow and the slapstick violence seems in bad taste. ",
            "Laugh out loud funny, endearing, richly human, and with a touch of political intelligence.",
            "The high-handed premise doesn't always work in Zohan but you have to admire the chutzpah in trying it.",
            "Nothing about You Don't Mess With the Zohan is profound or profoundly classic; it's both wildly uneven and intermittently entertaining, mostly because it wants to fuse lowbrow comedy with a satiric punch.",
            "It's perhaps not much of a schtick, but it's a cohesive schtick, with the sub-schticks of the entire cast well integrated in support and counterpoint.",
            "As a remedy for the Mideast's woes, American pluralism might be slightly impractical; but as a premise for a summer comedy, it's real enough to be funny",
            "I know someone out there must like these things, because Sandler keeps getting the money to make what is turning out to be the same movie over and over again, but I must not be tuned into his comedy wavelength.",
            "The idea that the unholy trinity of Sandler, regular cohort Rob Schneider, and director Dennis Dugan could re-unite after ...Chuck and Larry begs the question: just how much did these guys sell their souls to get another film green lit? ",
            "Warts and all, Zohan adds to a beautiful vision",
            "...the latest in a long line of underwhelming Adam Sandler comedies...",
            "You have to give Adam Sandler some credit: He is trying new things and working to expand his particular brand of juvenile comedy, albeit not always successfully.",
            "I cracked up during a lot of this movie."

            "The pain of [Davies'] latter-day distance from his home town comes through poignantly.",

            "The film invites a reverie. It inspired thoughts of the transience of life.",
            "Davies has carried out the duty of expansive memoirs. Instead of high-tailing it away from the rigors of reminiscence, he pushes headlong through them.",
            "Davies is a master of melancholy self-reflection. This film sheds light on where his feature films came from, as much as the city he lost.",

            "This personal and poetic meditation on England's portside city of Liverpool is a nostalgic journey through archival footage accompanied by an eclectic collection of lyrical ramblings by writer/director Terence Davies.",
            "Terence Davies may be a single-subject filmmaker, with that subject his own life, much as some writers write different versions of the same story. It doesn't matter. It's in the rich and detailed texture of the telling that his art lies.",
            "It is an undeniably slow film, but there is something enchanting in its pace, as it gradually immerses you in its imagery, its soundtrack and its otherworldly quality.",
            "The filmmaker's passion, coupled with a sly sense of humor, suggest that this is a film that will resonate long after it's over.",
            "All the images are stunning, but the film's star turns belong to the children who gather on front stoops and play among the city's derelict buildings.",
            "With this film, Terence Davies proves not only that he can find a story in even a place like Liverpool, but that he can make it poetic and interesting",
            " ... a filmic ode to Liverpool that is both elegiac and cantankerous in the way of all old men looking back.",
            "The film occasionally achieves beautiful states of reverie.",
            "A warm and extremely thoughtful journey, with a deliberately bare-bones narrative.",
            "The effect of visual movements in Of Time and the City is fantastic. Even as it documents urban life and recalls events, it offers Terence Davies' analyses of the history that has shaped him.",
            "Of Time and the City is a difficult film to describe but a distinct pleasure to experience.",
            "While not quite as imaginative, lively or captivating as My Winnipeg, Guy Maddin's homage to his hometown of Winnipeg, Canada, Of Time and City, at a running time of only 77 minutes, nonetheless manages to be a moderately fascinating, sporadically moving"

            "Even when the film feels murky, Miyazaki's painterly eye keeps things afloat",
            "Miyazaki's back, and still a force of nature. A weird, wonderful aquatic romp, Ponyo is also a meditation on the state of this blue planet. Catch it.",
            "We're drawn under the waves of the sea to a hidden enclave of neon-hued aqualife more vibrant, surreal and enchanting than any of the floating 3D whatsits in 'Avatar'.",
            "As usual, Miyazaki treads a thin line between intuitive, unshackled fantasy and simply seeming to makes things up as he goes along, but there is never a dull moment in the film's imagery.",
            "An arresting work from an unmistakable film-making personality.",
            "A simple tale, less freighted by foreboding than Miyazaki's recent output. In any case, storytelling is less important to him than mood or texture. His films are dream waltzes, all liquid motion and mysterious turbulences.",
            "Remains very safely in the realm of whimsical childhood adventure, sadly abandoning the heavy adversity found in previous efforts.",
            "With the exception of one or two arresting sequences, such as Ponyo dashing pell-mell on the crests of the storm's waves and the sight of prehistoric fish magically unleashed by the flood, the film just didn't enchant me.",
            "In a world in which innocence is so rarely portrayed with any conviction on the big screen, Miyazaki does so with incredible majesty and grace and awe-inspiring wonder. ",
            "I watched Ponyo for the first time this weekend, and I have one thing to report: Ponyo love Sasuke. Thank you for reading.",
            "Ponyo gets it. There are other, different worlds than this, but they don't have what we have. ",
            "The environments on display are even richer than those shown in \"Nausica\u00e4\", yet that movie has a much tighter structure. In the end it just doesn't matter.",
            "It is a stunning and joyful experience that I highly recommend for families to watch together.",
            "The score by Joe Hisaishi perfectly captures the essence of what's going on throughout the entire film... It evokes emotion and helps add so much to the film to connect you to it.",
            "At its best, this is a master working in a minor key; at its worst, it feels like a project in search of structure and conviction.",
            "Inspired very loosely by Hans Christian Andersen's original The Little Mermaid, Ponyo is an exceedingly charming modern fairy tale.",
            "Not as profound as Miyazaki's other works, but the fact that an animated children's film actually has the brains to go for larger, resonant themes is worth congratulation.",
            "Miyazaki's ode to motherhood; the sea is the greatest nurturer of all. The underwater sequences are some of Ghibli's most luminous, complex reflections of nature's teeming beauty.",
            "The fantasy elements are so seamlessly blended with real elements. There is very little disbelief by the characters, and you want to believe yourself by the end. ",
            "Apart from the ecofriendly message, we have, as always, Miyazaki's magnificently inventive animation, which is almost enough to carry the day.",
            "There's still plenty of gorgeous eye-candy to keep adults going if they've taken their kids along for some unthreatening entertainment.",
            "Let's say you have a five-year-old child who's not all caught up in the details of boring, mundane reality. Here's that kid's new favorite movie.",
            "For once, Japan's animation maestro is all at sea.",
            "A sweet love story about a boy and his fish, Ponyo is a weird yet wonderful children's fantasy, and marks another milestone in the career of Hayao Miyazaki. "

            "It's well-made. Searingly acted. Potent. And by the time it was over, its climax realized at the water's edge of insanity and grief, I felt beaten about the head with sticks.",
            "Yes, it's painful, but Snow Angels is so full of rich performances and characterizations that even gunshots can't kill its power.",
            "Tragedy is juxtaposed, clumsily, with stories from the so-called life of a high school student, as if the plot had sprained something in the course of its transition from Stewart O'Nan's novel to the screen.",
            "[Snow Angels] is aching with cross-purposes and shimmering with flirty jokes.",
            "It starts out as a lyrically beautiful work, but goes amiss at the halfway mark and concludes with a misplaced harrowing finale.",
            "There's still a lot of excellent work in Snow Angels. The first hour is utterly engrossing. But there's also a lot of wasted potential, which is too bad.",
            "Frequently perched between the poetic and the twee, Green has been bitten by the Whimsy Bug",
            "Impressive for the mood it creates, the film may not totally satisfy, but the characters are richly depicted and reflect the snowy winter chill that surrounds them",
            "David Gordon Green is a very unique filmmaker.",
            "Green is a director who takes his time with characters, allowing their different sides to self-illustrate in naturalistic settings as he simultaneously paints their worlds.",
            "Powerful performances all around, but too many tangled and twisted family trees. Scorecard, please.",
            "Rockwell, who brought a sense of desperate unease to his roles in 'The Assassination of Jesse James' and 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,' does the same here, with results that are at once frightening and pathetically sad.",
            "Every so often, a movie comes along that knocks the wind out of you. Snow Angels is one of them.",
            "...the film's positive attributes were for me not quite enough to make up for the movie's unrelentingly grim tone.",
            "It feels sort of like a poor man's version of American Beauty, stripped of all the good parts and devoted only to a low-budget wallowing in misery that will leave you shell-shocked and depressed on your way out of the theater.",
            "It's a hard movie to sit through at times, but if you're a fan of the actors, especially Rockwell, I believe you will find it a rewarding experience.",

            "despite the calmly logical way in which it allows its revelations to unfold and accumulate, this is an angry powder-keg of a film, exploding the reactionary myth that under certain circumstances torture can be acceptable, serviceable or even necessary."

            "The film's director, Doug Pray, has been able to track down each and every Paskowitz child, and he weaves their memories together with old home movies, still photos and news clippings to create an evocative portrait of their lives.",

            "In the end, Surfwise is a fascinating portrait of a family that manages to be both radical and conventional, divided but still tightly bound by blood."

            "Morning Light is a sunny, saltwater-splashed tale of inspiration.",
            "The documentary is enjoyable, though it could have been edited more tightly.",
            "For those who love sailing, Morning Light will confirm their passion and please them right down to their Top-Sider encased toes. For the rest of us, this sailors' tale just smacks of naval gazing.",
            "If you don't speak the jargon of sailing and racing, most of the conversations between teammates mean very little. Impenetrable editing reduces the action to a meaningless blur.",
            "The aristo-brats are required to jump into a swimming pool and tread water for five minutes with their shoes on. Horrible! Still, one of them nearly drowns, proving that he shouldn't be allowed near a body of water larger than a bottle of Poland Spring.",
            "These eager young amateurs have the kind of passion nobody could fake.",
            "(T)his may be one of those achievements in human endurance that doesn't elicit cheers, but sneers. It's just too picture perfected to be powerful.",
            "A vanity project...[but also] a sincere love letter to sailing, as seen through the eyes of a handful of very lucky youngsters. [Blu-ray]",
            "Any time...personal history is touched upon, it is quickly shoved under the carpet in favor of yet another sailing montage, complete with compulsory sunset.",
            "Morning Light fails as film or TV. It's essentially a vanity project for sailing enthusiast Roy E. Disney.",
            "This flat, uninspired sailing documentary from the Walt Disney studios has surprisingly little to say.",
            "All good intentions aside, Morning Light is nothing more than a glorified television documentary.",
            "The film may interest sailing enthusiasts. For the rest of us, Morning Light is a yawn.",
            "It's just so Disney. It could make you very cross.",
            "It's extremely good at communicating the joy of sailing, of putting its finger on the unique aesthetic appeal it offers its addicts and of making us believe that it is a precious gift that will enhance the future of these young people.",
            "The camera can only film the on-deck action from so many angles before it gets repetitive. The musical score is pabulum. Race technology and tactics are barely explored, and you never get a sense of the larger field of competitors.",
            "If the makers were hoping they'd chronicled a metaphor for life's struggle, they probably weren't counting on the struggle being monotony.",
            "A beautifully photographed documentary about a group of freshly scrubbed youngsters coming together for a grueling sailing competition.",
            "We get little explanation in the way of tactics or technique, and the filmmakers have compressed time into a bunch of cuts and platitudes about how the race will change the competitors' lives.",
            "Mostly the film is more appealing for its scenery, which is as breathtakingly blue as you'd expect, than for its drama.",
            "It has a lot of postcard-pretty pictures of glorious sunsets and fresh-faced kids. But for a movie about a lot of hard work, it is rather laid back."

            "Marrying small-screen formula to big-screen actors, Shoot on Sight is an earnest melodrama that struggles to surmount its good intentions.",

            "The taut, ultimately explosive drama shows most of its dramatic cards too early, but it boasts two memorable performances.",

            "Movies that pressure audiences into such extreme moral choices veer too close for comfort away from drama and towards their own set of ideological imperatives, in the service of propaganda."

            "The camera never leaves the beleaguered compound, and Beaufort itself becomes a character in the story, a surrealistic zone of tunnels, bunkers and sandbags, about as far from the possibility of heroism as possible.",

            "Engaging war drama that subtly mixes in several different genres to intriguing effect, though it occasionally relies too heavily on cliches.",
            "The film is slow and rather too long (and a bit preachy), but always intense, and its intentions are certainly clear.",
            "In the end [it] isn't about victory or defeat... It's about surviving another day, doing one's job, and getting back to family.",
            "Even if they do finally get to leave, the film's dispiriting message seems to tell us, in eight centuries there will probably be a new set of soldiers guarding Beaufort.",
            "It makes an urgent case for the futility of most wars, which serve immediate political goals that afterward don't seem terribly important.",

            "A war drama about waiting, and the director, Joseph Cedar, does a terrific job hanging danger and crushing tedium in the air, side by side.",
            "Despite the unremitting focus on the claustrophobia of outpost life, it's hard to ignore the by-now hoary tropes of the war movie with which Cedar litters his screenplay.",
            "An achingly honest account of the daily fears faced by soldiers.",
            "Aside from a pretty impressive final battle, there's little to engage here, although all that waiting around does mean there's time to nicely flesh out the characters, while the action scenes are well handled."

            "What Enlighten Up illustrates about the dynamic between filmmaker and subject is even more interesting than what it says about yoga.",
            "While Enlighten Up! is entertaining and provocative regardless, it's too bad that Churchill was so focused on whether Rosen was having his preconceptions shattered that she never stopped to consider her own.",

            "When she inserts herself into the action, she reveals only her own insecurity. It ends up being very enlightening, but probably not in the way Churchill intends.",
            "There's a lot of talk about the downward-facing dog in Enlighten Up, a yoga documentary I'm giving the downward-facing thumb.",
            "Rosen makes a good correlative for all of us who don't doubt that flexibility and fitness are worthy goals but who cringe at some of the quasi-religious babble that seems inextricably bound up with yoga.",

            "As a movie, Enlighten Up! doesn't really go anywhere.",
            "When Nick encounters B.K.S. Iyengar, the legendary guruji and one of the foremost figures of yoga, Churchill's mostly lightweight film radiates some spiritual light.",
            "I also think the film ends beautifully, the last third in particular a fascinating foray into the heart of India that made me feel a blissful tranquility I wasn't remotely expecting.",
            "Director Kate Churchill's acknowledged struggles to impose a story on ... six months' worth of documentary footage is not particularly successful...",
            "The premise ends up muddling a movie that might have been enlightening.",
            "The breezy title of this engaging documentary suggests that it isn't going to solve the big questions of life, but will at least treat its subject -- yoga in its many forms from the sublime to the utterly absurd -- with humor and an open spirit.",
            "A pleasure in its open-mindedness. If you're up for a safe, light, skeptic's look into the many variations of modern yoga, take a peek.",
            "What elevates the movie is the refusal of Rosen -- a grounded, non-believing pragmatist - to make the conversion to yoga spirituality and bliss that Churchill so wants for him, and for the arc of her documentary."

            "Thanks primarily to its inventive shooting style, Cloverfield is a terrifically frightening film."

            "For anyone with an interest in racing, First Saturday is a sure bet.",
            "Horse-racing fans will likely just find fun and nobility here; others may find a too easy faade stripped bare and ugly. Fate intervened in this film. Perhaps it was trying to tell us something.",

            " As the filmmakers tell us at the beginning, 40,000 Thoroughbreds are born every year, but only 20 make it to the Kentucky Derby. Thus starts the movie's confusion about whether it is a documentary about the horses or their human competitors.",

            "...once the Hennegans begin their build to the final race, everything false into place with a quickening intensity towards 'the most exciting two minutes in sports.'",
            "While competently made and an overall enjoyable experience for those with a less-than-passing interest in racing, the film will likely be only of interest to the deep-rooted fan.",
            "May takes its sweet time getting to the big day, but that eventually works in its favor, since the filmmakers are ultimately more concerned with the journey than the destination.",
            "It's pretty much for people who know the game well and want their perceptions massaged, not challenged.",
            "First Saturday isn't exactly a winner, but it places."

            "Trumbo is a solid effort made close to unmissable thanks in large part to Cranston's magnificence, the resulting biopic a gripping return to a Hollywood of yesteryear where the themes being examined couldn't be more appropriately timely.",
            "Credit must go to Cranston for giving this lean film some heft.",
            "For all the smart people involved in its making, and for all the smart people it's about, this is not a movie that's all that interested in complexity - in either its storytelling or its morality.",
            "The film is a labour of love for Bryan Cranston, as Trumbo. As Hollywood's greatest screenwriter, embattled but not beaten, he embodies the old Hemingway definition of courage: \"grace under pressure\".",
            "Bryan Cranston does a remarkably effective job of impersonating the man who played such a key role in the era of the McCarthy blacklist, from his raspy voice to his distinctive cigarette holder and his pungent sense of humour.",
            "A perfectly serviceable biopic boosted by great performances",
            "Trumbo should serve as a warning that history can repeat itself, and our freedom of speech is always in jeopardy.",
            "Construction flaws aside, the film manages to be both breezy and scathing precisely when it needs to be. This is due to a delightfully evocative production design as well as some exceptional performances.",
            "It would probably please Trumbo to hear a critic say Trumbo would have been better had Trumbo written it himself.",
            "Stand up and cheer for Trumbo! Under Jay Roach's direction with an Oscar-worthy script from John McNamara...Trumbo celebrates the 1st Amendment and the conviction of one man, with dignity, integrity, courage, bravery and intelligence.",
            "Overall, Trumbo benefits from the character-driven performance of Cranston, but the script and direction doesn't match in terms of quality.",
            "Placing Dalton Trumbo into the capable thespian hands of Bryan Cranston adds immeasurably to an already fascinating story.",
            "It overextends itself by trying to say something profound about personal integrity, privacy, and politics, but even that toxic ambition is so characteristically Hollywood that it's hard to be disappointed.",
            "Trumbo is just a bland information-delivery device.",
            "[Bryan Cranston] captures Trumbo's mannerisms... and is compelling as the rebel screenwriting genius.",
            "Despite its blacklist subject matter, keeps things light and irreverent with a wry screenplay, emphasising the absurdity of America's Communist paranoia post-World War Two.",
            "Trumbo is a film worth seeing, with an especially strong performance by Cranston that solidifies his great actor status even more.",
            "The locations, costumes and setting capture the glamour of old Hollywood; with an ensemble bringing that world alive with some on-the-nose portrayals of some of the era's greatest legends.",
            "A solid bio picture that may not always hit the mark, but it is anchored by a strong performance from Bryan Cranston.",
            "It's a shame that a movie about one of the greatest screenwriters who ever lived is so uninspired. A story like this deserves more gravitas, fewer guffaws. ",
            "Movie and history buffs will be immersed in this pointed and reference-filled exploration of one of the most infamous chapters in Hollywood and American history, while Cranston fans will be delighted to see the actor's immense talents translate so well ",
            "Cranston plays Trumbo as a magnificent thorn in the side of political right. His magnanimous personality, keen powers of persuasion and gift of the gab kept him safe for a while.",
            "Entertaining, swiftly moving, and just as witty as the man himself."

            "A fleet-footed, featherweight comedy riddled with cliches, but nonetheless charming and winning.",
            "A transparent romance/sports flick whose predictability is easily trumped by the refreshingly appealing parade of well-developed, Asian-American characters who make the movie enjoyable by turning an array of common cinematic stereotypes on their heads.",
            "Aside from the casting and the location shooting, there's not much to distinguish Ping Pong Playa from Ladybugs or The Mighty Ducks.",
            "To be perfectly blunt, Ping Pong Playa is third-rate crap. Unfunny crap. Unnecessary crap. This little entertainment is also unintentionally racist, misogynistic, homophobic, poorly acted, and shapeless."

            "The performances are expert, but can't make up for a flat script and direction.",

            "Despite terrific efforts from its lead players, Expired runs its meter out long before the end.",
            "one of the most inept, poorly-mounted productions of the decade",
            "Unconventionally quirky in its unassuming blue-collar bluntness, Expired is comically horrifying in its examination of lonely people living on the fringe of professional obscurity and personalized disarray.",
            "Miniucchi's screenplay is an unwieldy blend of pathos and unsettling moments, which become increasingly uninteresting as the film trudges to a dreary close.",
            "Call it an anti-rom-com, and see it if you can.",
            "The temptation is to say Expired is closer to \"Misfired,\" but there are just enough good things here (particularly Samantha Morton as a lonely-in-love meter maid) to avoid that label.",
            "Tough indie drama features great performances.",
            "Turns its uncomfortable central relationship into a fascinating study of symbiotic personalities.",
            "Locating both Claire's loneliness and Jay's anger as partial outgrowths of their detested profession handing out parking meter violation tickets, Expired coasts along on a distinctively odd wavelength.",
            "Assuming the shape of an old-fashioned indie, this offbeat romantic fable is a minor work that promises better things from its director; the narrative is considerably elevated by lead performers Jason Patric and the endlessly creative Samantha Morton.",
            "Morton is one of those tingly actresses whose skin barely covers her soul, and to watch her search for tender mercies in a crazy-hostile world is a gift. The film is appallingly good.",
            "How likely is it that love, not to mention hot sex, can blossom between two people who've picked identical careers dedicated to punishing the rest of us? Delightfully kinky sex and the city meter maid romp.",
            "Evokes a relationship so acidic between a couple of meter maids that the woman would probably feel better breathing in the acidic fumes outside than putting up with her man's insults.",

            "In its uncanny depiction of a weakling whose crimes pale against those of the war-mad society around him, it's a near masterpiece.",
            "Chaplin generates little sympathy. His broad-mannered antics, as a many-aliased fop on the make for impressionable matrons.",
            "Shapes up as Chaplin's most startling, most invigorating movie: its icy temperature is positively bracing after the hot syrup of his earlier work.",

            "Chaplin's most fully-conceived talkie.",
            "Henri Verdoux showcased Chaplin's crisp, flamboyant diction by playing against type. Never before had he played a deceitfully murderous man, slyly articulate and devilishly selfish in his conquest for corpses.",
            "It's quite a conundrum: a Chaplin comedy-drama that only resembles one after halfway into the plot.",
            "Its merit, to be crisp about it, is uneven. It has intervals that are highly entertaining. These occur when Chaplin reverts to type, the talented entertainer. It has other passages when it is nothing more than a pious, profound bore.",
            "Monsieur Verdoux is an acerbic and intelligent movie that remains unique for the public of our era. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "The film's cynical vision is as lucid as it is unrelenting.",
            "a pitch-black, arguably bitter comedy that wasn't so much a departure for Chaplin (he had, after all, lampooned Hitler in his previous film) as it was an opportunity to fully engage with his darker comedic impulses",

            "Monsieur Verdoux can boast a screenplay with a highly unusual moral complexity and a deeply philosophical bent...Yes, Verdoux is a film that name-drops Schopenhauer, but it's also damn funny... [Blu-ray]",
            "Thoungh misunderstood and a commercial flop in 1947, Chaplin's murderous satire has many merits, including Oscar nomination for Original Script. ",
            "It's not often you find Charlie Chaplin in the rare role of a villain, but he does nice work in this small tale of lies and murder.",
            "As it is, Monsieur Verdoux is a curiosity with flashes of brilliance, but definitely not one of Chaplin's best.",
            "Gives one a greater sense of Chaplin's political breadth from his previous work.",

            "Whatever happened to the analog days when kids found contentment by cramming phone booths, sitting on flagpoles or simply going steady?",
            "Antonio Campos's character study of a prep school social misfit named Robert (Ezra Miller) is an intimate psychological journey into a coded juvenile mindset.",
            "Perhaps it is the intent of Afterschool, to create such a distancing effect the viewer is forced to observe, perhaps even critique these young people's experience. If this is the case, Afterschool is one long period of detention.",
            "The passing of time and the evolution of technology may give it an expiration date, but more likely, Campos' film stands to be an essential document of what it was like to be a young person in the late '00s.",
            "Deserves credit for managing to make prep school seem like the most hellish place on the planet, but is at some points hard to watch for all the wrong reasons.",
            "Afterschool, the almost frighteningly accomplished first feature made by Antonio Campos when he was 24, is high school as horror show.",
            "An intelligent, often gripping, and intriguingly autobiographical drama of paranoia.",
            "At heart it's another unpleasant existential crisis for another unpleasant schoolboy in another unpleasant American prep school.",
            "It's an intriguing scenario, but what makes the film special (if at times slightly trying) is that it's all artfully shot in an apparently artless manner.",

            "Reminiscent of the alienation in classic Antonioni films or the paranoia of Michael Haneke, the icy Afterschool is a little too self-conscious in its artiness. Alternating between the fascinating and the tedious, it still worms its way under you skin.",
            "If there is one distinctive and promising voice to come out of the info-bite aesthetic of the YouTube generation it is Antonio Campos, whose debut feature Afterschool puts an intriguing spin on the high-school tragedy."

            "Bruce McDonald's adaptation of Maureen Medved's stream-of-consciousness teen novel The Tracey Fragments turns the screen into an ever-shifting mosaic, with anywhere from two to 20 separate images appearing at the same time.",
            "To criticize a film called The Tracey Fragments for being too fragmented may sound a bit on-the-nose, but this experimental drama from Canadian director Bruce McDonald is interesting for a while and then goes to pieces.",
            "I hated this movie. I really did.",
            "This audacious puzzlement is worth seeing, I guess, for some startling and innovative visual designs. But it doesn't amount to anything more substantial than a technical tour de force.",
            "Viewed as the sum of its sad incidents, The Tracey Fragments seems like the kind of adolescent melodrama that has become a staple of young-adult literature.",
            "I have a feeling that this is the last time we'll see a down-and-dirty Ellen Page.",
            "McDonald succeeds in capturing all the desperation, alienation, fantasies, and pain of a struggling adolescent, and the kaleidoscopic storytelling furthers his narrative instead of hindering it.",
            "While it's not completely the return to form we were hoping from this filmmaker, it is a strong indicator that he's back and willing to take creative risks at any cost. ",
            "Not for everybody, but relevant to everyone. There isn't a person alive who hasn't felt like the world was falling apart around them, and it is here that we can truly empathize with Tracey. ",
            "There are quite a few things to like about The Tracey Fragments, but the ultimate feeling I left with was one of contrivance - of difference for difference's sake.",
            "The first time I saw The Tracey Fragments, I felt as if I was seeing a revolution in film form, a new visual concept that made us process images in a fundamentally different way. ",
            "Even with the film's scant running time of 77 minutes, the unrelenting use of Mondrian splitscreen is bound to give anyone a headache.",
            "An exploration of the heightened, extreme emotional sensations of adolescence, The Tracey Fragments is demanding and relentless, an image overload in search of resolution.",
            "The split screen has never been used so purposefully or with such aesthetic care, capturing the multiple perspectives of a character who cannot separate reality from illusion because the whole world is inside her head.",
            "[Page is] virtually the sole reason to see this duller-than-it-sounds experiment.",
            "But Tracey Berkowitz is the anti-Juno: Where Cody Diablo's heroine is insouciant and confidently nonchalant, Tracey is angry, insecure and filled with an unsettling self-loathing, which Page brings to life with a searing immediacy.",
            "The Tracey Fragments is a grating stunt that plays like a film-school project, cutting a bland story into a million tiny irritating pieces.",
            "This angsty Canadian movie directed by Bruce McDonald takes its title all too literally: Every sequence is splintered into multiple split screens, which means that you can follow the dreary, semi-incomprehensible action from many viewpoints at once.",
            "Even the adorable Ellen Page is entitled to perform in a dud.",
            "Will be remembered as a shard in Page's filmography.",
            "Arty to the nth degree, splintered and, yes, fragmented",
            "The cinematic equivalent of a hyper-pretentious, solo performance piece whose style grows tiresome before you've even finished reading the playbill."

            "The Exiles is a vivid portrait of Native American culture. Even more astonishing is the fact the movie is more than 40 years old.",

            "The film sets just the right tone: with inventive music choices and wonderfully piquant moments plucked from what must have been hundreds of hours of footage, Frontrunners is consistently entertaining.",
            "Perhaps it's the bright, decent, appealing kids seen here, or just the idyllic portrait Suh paints of student life at Manhattan's prestigious Stuyvesant High School that gives the picture its charm.",
            "The kids now know how to play the game of college admissions, but they seem more jaded by their knowledge than entitled to success. And their exasperation with the process, their peers, and themselves is endlessly, illuminatingly watchable.",
            "Sure, it's a skewed view through adolescent eyes, but it's one that still speaks to the aspirations, agendas, image-making and spin control behind a real, grown-up political election.",
            "The student election plays out as a microcosm of the race for the Oval Office.",
            "The film accurately captures the world of adolescence. But emotionally and intellectually the film walks down the center stripe, picking up little insights while remaining bogged down in blandness.",

            "These candidates work hard and play fair, and when they screw up or slack off, they accept the consequences without complaint. Simply because, they believe, that's the way things should be done.",
            "what makes the movie fascinating is the particulars of the campaigns, from the way the candidates consider how to choose a running mate that will appeal to the right cliques, to how a win would improve their chances to get into a top college.",
            "If you're looking for meaningful parallels with the current monumental election don't bother, but it's hard not to enjoy a movie where the primary pundit sports a Flava Flav t-shirt.",
            "Ultimately, pic's fascination lies with the personalities and strategies of the candidates themselves.",
            "Frontrunners is a perfect antidote to the current overly staged presidential election spectacle. It shames the dishonest teen portrait of the recent doc American Teen.",
            "Without forcing comparisons, Frontrunners finds parallels between the election at Stuyvesant High and the current national election.",

            "Retro comedy about doo-wop singers hoping for one last score has great harmony, but lacks a catchy beat.",
            "Unforced camaraderie and some effective slapstick save this low-aspiration vehicle from its budgetary shortcomings.",
            "It's an enjoyable way to pass 90 minutes. But to call it an important movie with big ideas is like saying Miley Cyrus sings like Ella Fitzgerald.",

            "If you're a big Jackie Chan and/or Jet Li fan this movie was made for you and you should go see it on the big screen once. But because of a complete lack of storytelling effort from the filmmakers, there's no reason to ever see it more than once.",

            "Fans of either martial artist will probably find enough to enjoy out of this, and will even like it more if they like 80's fantasy films.",
            "Fueled by Jackie Chan and Jet Li, this enjoyable romp has plenty of kick.",
            "An unapologetically old-fashioned fantasy ... solid enough entertainment for grown-ups, but something that many kids will absolutely adore.",

            "Goes down remarkably easy, but not as to be forgettable...It's great to remember that action films could actually win you over by being fun and not just by being loud.",
            "The cast all turn in excellent performances and as a light, enjoyable caper RED succeeds, but ultimately it's lazy, derivative and immature.",

            "Wears a bit thin even at its brief length.",

            "It's dramatically unsatisfying.",
            "The world is uncomfortably perfect, and sparkly wide shots of stretches of landscape across which Alby walks reduce him to the lost little boy he insists on remaining, swallowed by the big bad world.",
            "Full Grown Men is nicely photographed and has impressive sets; too bad there's so little going on that it seems long even at 78 minutes.",
            "The candy-colored Full Grown Men wants to be a kind of anti-Wizard of Oz for a culture inundated with toys and toons.",
            "For better and for worse (at least for a story about a man struggling to behave like an adult), Full Grown Men feels and thinks with the heart and mind of a child.",
            "It's a beautiful, delicately observed comedy.",
            "This whimsically crafted tale that manages to be simultaneously silly, surreal and wise beyond years, is a combo memory lane, reverse time travel road movie and thirtysomething boy bonding satire, plus flaky storytelling in the extreme.",
            "As an audience member, you want to like your lead, or at least find something redeeming in him.",
            "Lyrical and funny, Full Grown Men is a tough-minded film about the need to grow up.",

            "Obviously, Munro is reaching for something about how people allow themselves to get mired in the past. But his characters and situations are so exaggerated and dreary that his point gets quickly lost."

            "Alexander's script considers context anathema, leaving us to wonder, among other puzzlers, why these two jerks are friends to begin with - and, perhaps, on what bad breakup or neglected childhood one may blame the film's dispiriting misanthropy.",
            "A road movie that runs out of gas almost immediately after it gets started, Backseat is the sort of quirky indie feature that impresses at festivals but feels wan when experienced under real cinematic conditions.",
            "Anyone who's spent a lot of time at independent-film festivals will feel a familiar sinking feeling within the first 10 minutes of Backseat.",
            "Culturally falling somewhere between Sideways and Dumb and Dumber, this low-rent road movie similarly rides on principles of audience identification, largely minus competent helming, thesping or scripting.",
            "Sporadically funny, micro-budgeted indie comedy.",
            "Backseat satisfies itself with small observations and minor breakthroughs of self-awareness.",
            "To be sure, slapstick misadventures ensue, but there's a sweetness and vulnerability beneath the surface of the boys' sometimes-blue bantering.",
            "Just a series of character skits, some charming and others tedious.",
            "The flailing, protagonists of Backseat, while not exactly 40-year-old virgins, can have avoided that fate only by the tender mercies of women with low expectations.",
            "Bruce Van Dusen's 2005 comedy plots a meandering course due north without locating a word of truth."

            "Moviegoers with a LaBruce fetish will appreciate another imaginative offering from the filmmaker. Mainstream audiences should stay far, far away.",
            "Otto deliriously intermingles sex and entrails but is also imaginative and witty",
            "LaBruce devotees will be tickled pink; others will be perplexed and/or disgusted.",
            "One of the more disciplined entries in the LaBruce oeuvre, Otto is sexy and silly in just the right proportions, a cult item with a real heart.",

            "LaBruce's film is such a riot of conflicting information and signifying styles that inner logic never really gets a grip.",
            "Some have described this as more cohesive than most Bruce La Bruce movies, but it's still sophomoric junk.",
            "Campy but not comical, reactionary but not very clever, LaBruce's film is best saved for those tickled by the sight of homo-zombie orgies or the hardcore penetration of an open wound.",
            "For a movie with this many ideological loose ends, Otto comes up with a convincingly sweet resolution.",
            "Veers between raw zombie cuisine, raw gay porn, high calorie sex that includes entrails-devouring as foreplay, and cranky anti-establishment rants against advanced capitalism. Not to mention that it's hard out there for a zombie too.",
            "When the viscera and seminal fluids are cleared away, there is something less flagrant but more durable resembling a beating heart inside this bloody stump of a movie -- a coded message to do with loneliness and loss.",
            "Bruce La Bruce's latest offering is a deadly affair of heavily politicized metaphors that overflows with imagination, angst and a smattering of good old fashioned porn.",
            "A genuinely touching horror-porn movie.",
            "Canadian queer-cinema provocateur Bruce LaBruce continues his trademark blend of sexual explicitness and shoddy technique with his numbing necro-porno, Otto; or, Up With Dead People."

            "Though director Olivier Megaton exhibits a good bit of that annoyingly jagged editing that's become all the rage in action films, he has the good sense to never cut away from Statham's pecs.",
            "Incoherent and inconsistent, this is a step back for Statham in his quest to become more than a cult figure.",
            "The flashy editing gets on one's wick and no one's going to win an Oscar - but, really, who's complaining? This is straight-up fisticuff fun.",
            "Transporter 3 is a reassuringly beefy thriller in which Jason Statham has to drive very fast across Eastern Europe with a Ukranian beauty queen on the seat beside him. No one, including Jason, has the slightest clue why. Never mind.",
            "Statham is a relatively entertaining action hero - though he is better in the Crank films. The script is by Besson, but the director is Olivier Megaton, whose surname is the most exciting thing about the film.",
            "Brings Frank Martin back to his outlandish (but not completely ridiculous) brand of martial arts mayhem, crazy femme fatale associates, and 200-mile-per-hour car chases.",
            "Paisa vasool entertainment!",
            "The car chases are exciting, the fight scenes hugely entertaining... and [Jason] Statham even handles Frank's emotional side with a sharp-edged style.",
            "...fares far better as \"Jason Statham's series finale\" than it did as \"another sequel not as good as the last one.\"",
            "For fans of Jason Statham and classic carsploitation action films.",
            "Usually stuff like this gets mercifully relegated to the 2 A.M. slot on HBO next to most recent Steven Seagal masterpiece. But The Transporter series has managed to gather enough of an audience for Lionsgate to inflict it on us every so often.",
            "The first film was slick, the second one silly, but at least we knew what was going on during those action beats.",
            "Transporter 3 is the cinematic equivalent of cotton candy: a quick sugar rush that melts in your mouth and is forgotten five minutes later.",
            "A 'what not to do' guide when making an action film.",
            "A preposterous, over the top and entertaining return of Frank Martin, the courier who delivers anything without question. Forget the ludicrous plot and just sit back and enjoy the fight and driving sequences.",
            "Most film trilogies usually drop the ball on the third entry, but if you want to see it done right, check out the fun, unpretentious Transporter 3.",
            "The good thing about Transporter 3 is that you know exactly what to expect. There's reluctant hero Jason Statham, a deadly villain, exotic European locations, car chases, hot action and .. of course there's a girl",
            "With insulting action sequences and a tacked-on love scene, the movie quickly veers into a downward spiral.",
            "As a fan of Statham and the Transporter series, it's a massive disappointment. The story makes no sense, and there aren't even very many fight scenes.",
            "I wanted to be transported out of the theater."

            "This is one of Woody's throw-away movies. It's as if he has a compulsion to make them, just as he has to haul his ass down to Michael's Pub in Manhattan every Monday and play clarinet. ",

            "What you see is less reflective of old glories and more indicative of a new composure that inflicts a lot of Allen's newest endeavors, in which characters are seen engaging in discussions that test the limits of their deadening comforts.",

            "Perhaps confusing the audience is what Forster meant when he said he was making an art house picture.",
            "At the end of Solace there are a couple of unhappy but typical realizations: 1) that the film only runs 106 minutes when it seemed more like 166, and 2) that it's still hard to say whether Daniel Craig moves well as an action hero.",
            "Somehow Marc Forster's direction sucks all the vitality out of the film. There's no thrill in the chase. With the exception of an absolutely first-rate fight sequence on scaffolding in a church under renovation, Bond is having no fun at all.",
            "Kurylenko is certainly gorgeous, but can't match Craig as a thespian, and the necessary chemistry between them is merely mundane.",

            "A lot of reviewers seem to have disliked Street Kings because of its negative view of the LA police, and perhaps the country at large. That is not a problem for me.",

            "There is certainly something compelling in the film's ideas, but the way they're executed suggest that any true questions about morality and the law are just grist for the action mill.",

            "While military man turned director Ayer implicates our culture steeped in violence and the damaging effects of trained killing, whether by police or in war, he's assembled such a deplorable LAPD rogues gallery, it's hard to tell which one is the worst.",
            "Ayer's rapid pacing and solid work by the cast distract us from the script's shortcomings.",
            "Ellroy, who also co-wrote the screenplay, and Ayer share an interest in L.A. after dark, and they explore the city's neon-bathed streets with the glee of children in a funhouse, watching the distortions of everyday people in bent mirrors.",
            "I don't think there were really any bad scenes, but I found the overall film emotionally empty.",
            "Granted, it doesn't revolutionize the cop genre, but it definitely does a solid job of entertaining for its runtime, and as a movie-watcher (and lover)...ain't much else that I can ask for than that.",
            "[In the] surprisingly engrossing 'Street Kings,' we are presented with cops who live up to our worst nightmare of excessive force.",
            "The movie has a million flaws, but if you can look past them and enjoy a fun, gritty, violent, racist and entertaining dirty cop film, then you will have fun with it."

            "[Has] plenty of thrills, a smart although oft-confusing script, delightful scenery-chewing scenes from stalwarts like Helen Mirren, Jim Broadbent and Andy Serkis, and a gorgeous high-concept visual style.",
            "Seemingly intended as a celebration of the power of books, it's an occasionally incoherent, sleep-inducing picture that reduces narrative to mere mechanics.",

            "If early slasher films, as their critics claimed, punished teens for having sex, the new 'Prom Night' punishes teens for their conspicuous consumption (stretch limos, hotel suites, and so on).",
            "It's tepid fare with a vacuous cast, particularly when compared with the previous version featuring Jamie Lee Curtis as the scream queen.",
            "While it's certainly not as atrocious as the likes of \"One Missed Call,\" it's certainly one of the worst of 2008, so far..."

            "Gus Van Sant's portrait of San Francisco politician Harvey Milk clunks along as the squarest movie he's ever made, a result of the director investing more emotion in the martyred idol than in the bleeding man.",

            "Sean Penn's portrayal of Milk stands out, with his considerable weight loss and authentic body language... [Full review in Spanish]",
            "[Dustin Lance] Black's attempts to dress up this schema in the gay trappings afforded by his subject do nothing to meaningfully pervert the form-or Milk's emotional tidiness.",
            "Penn's performance is inspiring, a transformation that finds the heart and soul of a historical figure and sends blood pumping through a man who has become practically deified over the decades. ",
            "While making a political, historical biopic, Van Sant managed, concurrently, to make a visually beautiful, emotionally thrilling and surprisingly personal work of art.",
            "Penn burrows inside his character, capturing not only Milk's Long Island Jewish intonations and his gay body language but also the intensity of his beliefs and the particular mix of fear and desire through which he viewed the world.",
            "Harvey repeats throughout the film, \"you've gotta give 'em hope.\" He did the legwork. The film is just a reminder.",
            "The movie's getting a lot of praise for being an \"unconventional\" biopic. I don't think this is true, but it's happening, I suspect, because it's NOT a biopic: It's a cause movie."

            "The new film is mildly amusing family entertainment, but when discussing the career of one of our most seasoned comic actors, \"mildly amusing\" can only be regarded as a letdown.",
            "There's a delicious irony to the way in which this supposedly heartwarming comedy gives the impression of having itself been devised by a race of extra-terrestrials with only a tentative grasp of what constitutes heart or humour.",
            "The puzzler that is Eddie Murphy's career continues apace with this low-fi kiddy-oriented affair featuring the comedian as both a human-shaped spaceship called Dave Ming-chang and the commander of said vessel.",
            "This is made-for-TV material dressed up by Eddie Murphy's participation into a theatrical release.",
            "Avoid like the plague.",
            "Better than average but not worth phoning home about.",
            "A disappointment from an actor who has recently shown the world he's capable of mighty fine acting.",
            "I might even go out on a limb and actually say that Meet Dave is, um, good.",
            "I'm sure a more refined filmmaker could've squeezed the premise tighter for sophisticated laughs, but as family-angled sci-fi comedies go, Dave is actually quite agreeable. Who knew Murphy still had some fun left in him?",
            "A comedian known for his brash wit and go-for-broke charm, Murphy used to be willing to say anything to get a laugh. Now, he's clearly willing to do anything.",
            "Failure couldn't happen to a nicer guy.",
            "...one could certainly do much worse as far as Murphy's family-friendly output goes.",
            "If you think Eddie Murphy lost his mojo about 20 years ago and has been lacking clear comedic judgment ever since, then you've got to see this for confirmation. Or maybe not.",
            "den hanei stigmi ap' ta matia toy to one-joke thema toy, kai agkomahaei mehri to telos na soy anamasisei ayta ta mikra paraksena pragmata poy mas kanoyn anthropoys ki enas eksogiinos tha ebriske paranoika",
            "certainly a step up from Norbit...",
            "A movie starring Eddie Murphy used to mean something good. Now it just means that you should avoid anything he does at all costs. MEET DAVE is a disaster of epic proportions.",
            "Heralding a return to form for Eddie Murphy, this cleverly conceived and executed sci-fi comedy offers plenty of laughs for all ages. The considerable challenge for the filmmakers was to streamline three realities and make each one credible.",
            "Unless you're a die-hard Eddie Murphy fan, there's no reason for you to 'Meet Dave,' a substandard comedy that should have gone straight to DVD."
