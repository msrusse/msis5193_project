            "When teenaged Andy plops down on the grass to share his old toys with a shy little girl, the film spikes with sadness and layered pleasure -- a concise, deeply wise expression of the ephemeral that feels real and yet utterly transporting.",
            "There are many sweet laughs and joking allusions to horror and prison-break movies, but the Pixar gang gets at the most primary fear -- being cast off and no longer of use.",
            "I seriously doubt there will be a more hilarious and heartfelt blockbuster all summer.",
            "It's still more inventive, clever and laugh-out-loud funny than any other movie out there now.",
            "By [Pixar's] high standards this isn't the best, but by anyone else's, it's close to perfection.",
            "Nothing short of brilliant.",
            "Yet another masterful creation by Pixar Animation Studios.",
            "Not in the same league as Pixar's previous efforts ... it still solidifies the notion that this production company is at the forefront of modern animation.",
            "Toy Story 3 is not only one of Pixar's best films, but perhaps the best of the Toy Story trilogy.",
            "...an inventive and often completely gripping adventure...",
            "While threepeats may be rare in the sports world, they're even harder to achieve in the cinematic realm. Yet here's Toy Story 3, bucking the odds and satisfying sky-high expectations.",
            "Something deeply, almost primal in a powerful way, tapping into the emotional core of an entire generation and the eternally young at heart.",
            "More than lives up to the lofty expectations as a worthy addition to the already classic series. There is something for everyone in the film, which is easily the best major American studio release I've seen in 2010.",
            "Toy Story 3 has magic in spades.",
            "Dear Pixar, THANK YOU for not churning out yet another inferior straight-to-DVD animated sequel, and instead taking the time to create something that will be as dear to Toy Story fans at the first time we saw Woody & Buzz on screen.",
            "From moments of pure delight to one of the most heartbreaking goodbyes in recent movie memory, the trilogy wraps up in a masterful way and once again proves Pixar is on a level all its own.",
            "Leave it to Pixar to subvert the Hollywood rule of sequels, which states that each subsequent film must have eyes full of dollar signs at the expense of quality.",
            "With a heart felt ending and truly outstanding story, Toy Story 3 has ensured that the franchise and all the characters we have known and loved, will be remembered for infinity, and beyond.",
            "What's so distressing about all this, as I keep pointing out, is the tremendous talent of the Pixar team getting wasted on nostalgic goop, forever presenting idealized 1950s suburban culture as the norm.",
            "Moments of uproarious humor and emotional farewells offset the darkness and send Woody and his pals on a memorable ride off into the sunset.",
            "Like last year's Up from the same company, Pixar, this film tickles the funny bone but also brings a tear to the eye.",
            "Hilarity, terrors, the melancholy of love and loss and growing up, and millions of adult-baby tears ensue.",
            "It's not the usual Hollywood conveyor-belt product. Made with love and intelligence, this adventure has enough thrills, laughs and emotion to satisfy any adult or child."

            "How to Train Your Dragon boasts stunning visuals, particularly the gorgeous and exhilarating dragonback flying scenes, which are worth the extra cost for 3-D tickets.",
            "So far, the best animated movie of 2010. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "It's charming, funny and a lot like Avatar, though less solemn and an hour shorter.",
            "Instead of relying on dizzying gimmicks, Dreamworks' new animated feature simply revels in the sheer heart-pumping pleasure of watching action unfold through those Buddy Holly-style glasses.",
            "Undoubtedly Dreamworks' best film yet, and quite probably the best dragon movie ever made.",
            "Everything from the angle of the shot to the speed of the editing projects an end visual that feels like you're either on Toothless' back or you get an outsider perspective of just how fast he's flying.",
            "What helps elevate How to Train Your Dragon above the glut of other recent animated fare is its message about tolerance and realizing that your enemy may not be as different as you think.",
            "This is the best animated film since Coraline. It proves that adventure can be fun and still say something.",
            "How to Train Your Dragon glossily repackages two of the most common themes echoed in animated family movies: embracing uniqueness and rebelling against conformity.",

            "Though it sounds like it ought to have more in the way of exploitation and gore, Romero shoots it straight, hoping his social commentary will carry it. It works superbly.",
            "Edited at a sprint, the movie is often shocking, occasionally gory, and never boring.",

            "Though the film was a box-office dud in the US, Brooks delivers an amusing and consistenly engaging relationship piece that is a cut above the standard romantic comedy. ",

            "It's not enough to merely swoon over Witherspoon. The movie's entirely too long and leaden to get by on that alone. ",

            "Even Nicholson's usually scene-stealing bluster can't get this disappointing addition to the Brooks filmography going.",
            "Every scene is as achingly long and laboured as the film's instantly forgettable title.",
            "More creative energy has gone into furnishing these characters' apartments than devising credible emotional situations to put them in; the result is wholly undemanding, and best saved for a long-haul flight.",

            "Seemingly well-intentioned and inoffensive - but there are so many other films that do this sort of thing faster, better and with more jokes, including a couple from writer-director James L Brook's own back catalogue."

            "Wright delights in setting up the tale with a mix of comedy, great production design and Fight Club style visual gags. On the downside, Cera's standard goofy geek stereotype has become slightly wearing.",
            "A defiantly youthful, but nevertheless mature film that is not quite like anything you will have seen before. ",
            "Does it seem pandering? Are they sick of the bleating, narrow-shouldered Michael Cera type-casting? Do they dislike having their sense of leading epic lives pointed out for laughs, especially in the grandiose form that is cinema?",

            "Scott Pilgrim is not what you expect. It's not what the marketing made you expect. It's better than that. Funnier, sweeter, with eye-popping visuals and characters who feel so flawed and real they could be your own brother, sister, or friend."

            "An accessible and enjoyable watch.",

            "The crumbs of happiness the filmmakers find to soothe us with are that learning Sarah's story helps Julia come to terms with her own problems, a neat resolution that trivializes the story the filmmakers mean to illuminate.",

            "Sarah's Key is elevated by luminous performances by two actresses -- veteran Kristin Scott Thomas and 10-year old Melusine Mayance. Fortunately their talent often is able to transcend the contrivances that mar the plot."

            "Although it's replete with solid supporting players and even stronger goodwill, Just Wright buckles under the burden of its pure intentions. Too many auxiliary, moralizing plot points and characters are picked up, only to be suddenly dropped.",

            "Utterly predictable, unbearably trite.",
            "Easy-going and sweet-natured, this \"romantic sports comedy\" finally dissolves into a gooey mess of over-cooked comfort food.",

            "Technically speaking, this is a romantic sports comedy. We don't get many films in which these elements work well as a team.",
            "In a Queen Latifah film, and most assuredly in this Queen Latifah film, love is always possible and even the people who disappointment you the most are ultimately redeemed.",
            "Latifah and Common have great chemistry and it's another romance where we like both of them and want to see them happy.",
            "tries to do too many things",
            "All of this predictability and retreading of the same old formula just makes for one long, stretched-out film that leaves the audience waiting for the inevitable to happen.",
            "The audience, much like Latifah, is surprised and utterly won over by Common's disarming, nice guy affability beneath the intimidating aura.",
            "You've seen it before -- it lifts from Pretty Woman and The Truth About Cats & Dogs, to name a couple -- but you won't hate seeing it again.",
            "Just Wright's heart is in the right place. It just doesn't know what to do with it.",
            "Flips the over-expressed male fantasy of the socially awkward guy who somehow ends up with the hottest girl.",
            "A bland Cinderella story that never steps out of its comfort zone.",
            "It might not be the blandest rom-com youve ever seen, but its sure within striking distance.",
            "It's rescued by the warmth of the two central performances. It also makes a pleasant change to see a woman of generous proportions land a handsome guy.",
            "Take a pro basketball player with a career-threatening knee injury and an ugly-duckling nurse and you've got the blueprint for a steamroller of sopp that knows no shame.",
            "Likeable turns from Queen Latifah, Common and Pam Grier elevate the fairly rote material -- no big surprises here -- into a fun, basketball-based spin on the romantic-comedy.",
            "If film titles get any lazier than this, I'm flying to Hollywood and setting fire to the Writers' Guild HQ building.",
            "For the romatically inclined, it's just right.",
            "Stays watchable thanks to a charming, likeable performance from Queen Latifah, but it's also insipid, predictable, overlong and occasionally annoying.",
            "...a superior romantic comedy...",
            "A good formula movie and it goes down its structural checklist with a sense of \u00e9lan, a variation or two and a freshness in terms of the characters."

            "Confused, poorly executed, sporadic and incredibly messy, but despite its pitfalls, My Soul to Take is an enormously entertaining bad movie.",

            "It's talky, schlocky and stalk-y.",

            "There is little doubt that Another Year will be a film that will stay with you long after the closing credits.",

            "Another year, another 100 things to celebrate and mourn-and another film that makes me appreciate how good cinema can make me feel.",
            "Although caring, cheerful and kind individuals feature prominently, with much to laugh about, Another Year is really about the emotionally bruised amongst us, about regret, about envy, and the fact that life is often cruel.",
            "It is beautifully played, free of the usual tics and twitches and palsies that so often afflict Leigh characters, and Manville, in particular, gives everything she has, which turns out to be an awesome amount.",
            "With its slow movement and at times painful portrayal of human wretchedness, it would be hard to imagine a less fun time at the movies than Another Year, but it would also be hard to imagine a more worthwhile one.",
            "This turnaround isn't enough to completely salvage it, but it turns it from Leigh's worst film into an interesting, honorable failure.",
            "This movie is really about a departure.",
            "Mike Leigh doesn't do thrill rides or happily ever afters, and this character-driven drama marks no new territory for the director. But it may just be his best film yet.",
            "This movie makes me want to avoid my married friends.",
            "Another Year is an extremely accessible and gripping film with beautifully observed character moments and outstanding performances by a superb cast, especially Leslie Manville who shines as Mary. ",
            "It's not the most focused Leigh movie, but plot has never been his strong suit.",
            "Leigh sculpts Another Year in time like Edgar Degas painted a picture.",
            "Mike Leigh is often dumped in the dour, 'kitchen sink' genre of British filmmaking, but that is to overlook his wily sense of humor.",

            "...a light, rather cheerful movie that tells its story in an uncomplicated fashion while leaning heavily on '60s style and fashion - it's sort of a Mad Men meets Norma Rae meets Laverne & Shirley affair",

            "In short, Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life is a charmer.",

            "Great songs, beautiful girls, lovely costumes and an artist in a constant state of flux are emphasised in Joann Sfar's imaginative, beautiful and suitably bizarre musing on the life of Serge Gainsbourg.",
            "If there's one thing that Joann Sfar's Gainsbourg told me, it's that he smoked...a lot. And sometimes, he didn't shave for a few days... However, this was about all the insight provided by Sfar's competent effort.",
            "The self-consciousness of identity, in the form of that puppet, inevitably gets in the way of the storytelling.",
            "Sfar is helped no end by an astonishing performance from Eric Elmosnino, who also performs many of the songs on the soundtrack.",
            "In conjoining Jewish heritage and classic French chanson, Gainsbourg celebrates the hybridity of contemporary French culture, while its combination of realist narrative and poetic animation make it both a touching biopic and an inspired musical.",

            "A cartoonist who created a graphic novel about Gainsbourg's life and who has now adapted it to the screen. The result is a film that's as playful as its subject matter although not nearly as provocative or complex.",
            "Overall, the film makes a common mistake: it tells what happened to Gainsbourg, but not who he really was.",
            "Very nearly as inventive and fascinating as it is frustrating.",
            "Sfar, perhaps understandably, adores the legend of Serge Gainsbourg too much to make the whole nicotine-infused picture anything greater than what it is.",
            "Whatever its faults, it's better than Nine.",
            "Why was Gainsbourg a hero? The film leaves the question hanging. I am afraid it was only because, like Sinatra, he did it his way. Which no one can deny.",
            "Elmosnino gives a deft and moving performance as the insecure piano player who reinvents himself as Gainsbourg, pop poet and improbable ladies' man, impelled to break taboos not only out of anger, but also to affirm his own existence.",
            "A viewer who comes into \"Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life\" knowing nothing about Serge Gainsbourg will not come out the other side especially enlightened about the late French-Jewish singer-songwriter's life, least of all why it is heroic.",
            "As a musical mischief maker who exuded endless existential ennui, Serge's complexity is just too ungainly for any one biopic - but G:AHL is great starter kit. ",
            "Gainsbourg is a noble attempt and interesting enough to keep you watching, but it's bound to disappoint fans of the singer's and possibly will confuse any newcomer to the story.",
            "Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life accepts its subject on his own terms. And the compromise feels like capitulation before its hero's last record spins to a close."

            "[T]hough doubtlessly reactionary, Straw Dogs has the heat of personal commitment and the authority of deep (if bitter) contemplation.",
            "The script... relies on shock and violence to tide it over weakness in development, shallow characterization and lack of motivation.",
            "The most offensive thing about the movie is its hypocrisy; it is totally committed to the pornography of violence, but lays on the moral outrage with a shovel.",
            "Upon first viewing, it seems like a straightforward film, but the more one watches it, the more tension one sees in the relationship between the couple.",
            "Mr. Peckinpah has made some good films (Ride the High Country) and a couple of great films (The Wild Bunch, The Ballad of Cable Hogue) -- which may be why Straw Dogs is a special disappointment.",
            "Eyes Wide Shut -- and the cooked-up debates surrounding it -- are only about sex in the head. Peckinpah gives you sex as a kick in the groin, a jolt to the brain and a shot to the heart.",
            "The ending is breathtaking as an out-of-control, pulse-pounding revenge fantasy.",
            "I can think of no other film which screws violence up into so tight a knot of terror that one begins to feel that civilisation is crumbling before one's eyes.",
            "[Straw Dogs] seemed to me utterly bogus in its reversal of the invariable truth that an expatriate American intellectual is the hunter and the local population the prey.",
            "We see it. but we can't believe it. Nor can Hoffman.",
            "A declining industry has invested over a million dollars In a new form of pornography for which the public are demonstrating they have an Insatiable appetite. That is the problem.",
            "The questions it raises about sexual consent, masculinity, and humanity's penchant for violence are as urgent today as they were in 1971.",
            "One of the most ambiguous, neurotic, and disturbing of all American films receives a revelatory new restoration, with supplements that ably grapple with its chaos.",
            "A taut drama with great performances and a recipe for action and tension that modern-day thrillers could learn from.",
            "But what if the mask of your neighbor tilts for a second and you catch a glimpse of the riot going on behind his face? What if you accidentally see the monster feasting on his prey? Now what if you're looking in the mirror?",
            "It ends up hackneyed, unnecessary, and clich\u00e9d, improved only by the A-list acting talent and slickness of the production values.",
            "Ugliness that must be taken seriously",
            "Anchored by Dustin Hoffman's seminal performance, Peckinpah's second masterpiece (after The Wild Bunch) is still one of the most provocative, controversial, and ambiguous explorations of actual violence and our reaction to screen violence.",
            "Gory and shocking.",
            "Um assustador estudo sobre o animal interior do Homem que, mesmo moralista, conservador e mis\u00f3gino, impressiona por sua complexidade.",
            "One of Sam Peckinpah's finest films, a relentless study in violence and machismo that is shocking, not only for its explicit gore, but for the degree to which it manipulates 'civilized' audiences.",
            "Peckinpah's treatise on violence and masculinity is disturbing on a fundamental level... and equally difficult to forget.",
            "A meaty uncompromising movie from the masterful Sam Peckinpah."

            "Get Low is an unexceptional film, but Duvall's presence elevates it beyond all expectation",
            "That the finale ends up being trite is a shame, but the long, gentle jaunt to arrive there is a pleasurable one.",
            "The creaky foreshadowing is a big problem, and the movie runs in place for most of its second half, though Duvall manages to pull it back on track with his climactic soliloquy, which sobers and silences the carnivalesque funeral party.",
            "Duvall's irascible, shotgun-wielding Felix Bush is matched by a brilliant supporting cast...",
            "If you take the Southern kitsch with a grain of salt, Get Low is otherwise a largely amiable, enjoyable film.",

            "Highly unusual drama - with black comedy elements - which allows Duvall to showcase his refined skills.",
            "The ponderous route of the film is livened up by the presence of the deadpan Bill Murray",
            "The mighty Robert Duvall delivers an astounding turn as a man whose soul is burdened by the weight of regret in Get Low.",
            "Basically, it's Hollywood slush dressed up as American Gothic.",
            "It's Duvall's film, and he brings a gravity and poetry to Bush that sets him apart from the script's more prosaic moments. ",
            "As if it even needs to be said, Robert Duvall really is great as Felix Bush; he reveals himself so slowly and steadily, as to unveil facets of his character and personality only when he sees fit. It's a performance that deserves a better screenplay.",
            "Duvall shines in engaging tale of guilt and redemption",
            "A performance film with soul and heart and a terrific sense of the place and time, with music to match, this is a film for the movie connoisseur",
            "Here's a film that grabs you from the outset and keeps you intrigued throughout its story about life, love and redemption",
            "Robert Duvall is 79 now and still hits it out of the park every time.",
            " Duvall's work here has little in way of grand emotional declarations or Oscar-reel moments, but it is a calmly anguished, fiercely committed turn.",
            "Robert Duvall, Sissy Spacek and Bill Murray lend their mega-watt talents to a undemanding movie. Beautifully shot but let down by an underwhelming final act.",
            "Featuring some enthralling performances from Murray, Spacek and last but by no means least the great Duvall, you might find yourself whimpering unexpectedly in this looming yet comical adaptation of a Tennessee fable."

            "It's stripped of narration, talking heads, and anything else that might threaten to slow it down.",
            "You don't have to know a lick about racing to become completely engrossed by 'Senna.'",
            "As you might imagine, these first-person images of key races are some of the film's most pulse-quickening, awe-inspiring moments. ",
            "Kapadia's remarkably clear direction traces Senna's personal development from fresh-faced idealist fighting the Formula 1 bosses, to successful superstar to cynical competitor. ",
            "Senna is one of those documentaries that's clearly deeply meaningful to fans, but it also happens to be viscerally engaging for those with no prior interest in the subject.",
            "This is not just a good film - it's a great film: fascinating, exciting, nerve-wracking and profoundly moving.",
            "Kapadia's film isn't just a moving resurrection of the driver and his phenomenal career; it's a timely nod to our increasingly competitive times, as we attempt to restart from a long stall of selfishness, and reconstruct the engine of meaning in the pits.",
            "An engrossing, nerve-wracking and beautifully crafted examination of a sporting hero, Kapadia's documentary is a must-see.",
            "[Director Asif Kapadia] allows his documentary gaze to fall upon the sport of motor-racing in this thrilling exploration into the life of a man who aimed to do as much for those less fortunate as he than he did for the sport.",

            "...a surprisingly deft examination of the power of faith...",

            "If we define a classic documentary by its ability to transcend niche subject matter and engage all audiences, then the exhilarating and unbelievable Senna is one of cinema's recent best.",

            "\"Senna\" is a streamlined piece of filmmaking, completely immersing the viewer in Senna's world and never losing momentum as it moves from one breakneck race to another. ",

            "Bran Nue Dae is a kooky, deliriously happy mix of happenstance and broadly-drawn characters who are apt to break into song at any given moment. It's not quite enough for me to recommend, but I'm not unhappy to have seen it.",
            "A difficult sit for anyone unable to tune into the film's dedication to bootleg turns of plot and characterization, with the whole endeavor starting to feel like a dental drill after the first act. ",
            "It's a bit corny and reminiscent of Baz Luhrmann or Julie Taymor's pop fantasies, but we can forgive her.",
            "Doesn't hit on all cylinders but features some great original ideas and a bunch of catchy song and dance numbers sure to delight audiences of all ages. ",
            "Delightful musical trip of a teenage Aborigine through 1960's Australian outback with wonderful rocking mix of song genres, let alone hippies, to feel like Hair.",
            "The songs aren't exactly the catchiest, its message of tolerance far from new, but it sure is lively while it lasts.",
            "Trite, silly, and grating are all apt words to describe the cinematic buffoonery of Rachel Perkin's Bran Nue Dae, a flimsy excuse for a nostalgic musical that shoots for playful satire but ultimately proves staggeringly impotent. "

            "The journey is aided immeasurably by the casting of Keir Gilchrist as young Craig. He has dark, sensitive eyes and a probity about him that wins you to his side.",
            "Features an exceptional cast, a sensible blend of dark humor with dramatic overtones, and the inclusion of several creative fantasy sequences.",
            "In truth, it's probably the kind of material better handled in a three-minute emo song than an entire film where its navel-gazing sensitivity is inflated to ridiculously enormous proportions.",

            "Galifianakis [is] able to turn on a dime; balancing his disarming humour with moments of anguished outbreaks. His is one of the best supporting performances of recent memory; equally funny and heartbreaking. If only I could say the same of the movie.",

            "I'm sure some will disagree with the points that Davis Guggenheim is making. That's to be expected but it will help generate a badly needed debate on this subject matter.",

            "While there are gaps left uncanvassed, this remains an absorbing exploration of a crucial issue which not only exposes problems, but offers answers.",
            "Just as he passionately got stuck into Al Gore's global warming theories in An Inconvenient Truth, Davis Guggenheim explores the US school system in an expose of its appalling inadequacies... an excellent and sobering documentary",

            "Far from the usual slapstick laced with smarts comedy, Greenberg is Ben Stiller's Punch Drunk Love. ",
            "As a study of stasis and of people conscious of not living the lives they had imagined for themselves, the picture offers a bracing undertow of seriousness beneath the deceptively casual, dramatically offhand surface.",
            "Like the director's Kicking and Screaming and Margot at the Wedding, it works as an almost perfect example of a certain kind of American neurosis.",
            "Baumbach is capable of brilliant dialogue, and certain scenes have a tidy truthfulness that recall Woody Allen at his pinnacle.",
            "Gerwig has an unaffected screen presence that is oddly compelling: a kind of luminous ordinariness",
            "Lurching between comedy and agony, Noah Baumbach's new film appears to be the simple tale of a man recovering from a nervous breakdown. Yet Greenberg resonates for days afterwards, like a hangover after a peculiar and fascinating party.",
            " Stiller manages to somehow turn Greenberg, the man, into a sympathetic man-child.",
            "It is a painful, funny, truthful read on our own times and a peculiar and distressing moment that often happens at 30 or 40 or 50.",
            "Although the film sometimes drags (especially for one with a 90 minute run time), Baumbach and Stiller both score a mutual coup with Greenberg.",
            "On balance, I found my feelings for Greenberg running hot and cold, as if I was being been infected by the protagonist's jagged mood swings. A good sign, I guess. But that's the thing about a misanthropic movie...",
            "The indignities of modern life that Greenberg can't bear are peculiarly American. And so is this thoughtful and hilarious film, though some might feel its arty moments and lack of action seem more European.",
            "Greenberg is a fantastically complex part to play, but Stiller's performance is superbly nuanced, convincing and brave.",
            "This is a sunny, prosperous movie, full of bright light and swimming pools, casual hospitality and people going out to dinner; but its problems are not external villains. It's the internal demons which menace.",
            "Thanks to writer-director Noah Baumbach's sharply witty dialogue and poignant performances from Stiller and Gerwig, you can't help but root for these lost souls to find their happy ending.",
            "Greenberg is a great spectacle of toxic emotional stasis.",
            "It's not as substantial as it believes itself to be, but Greenberg is a good movie, and contrary to a lot of critical practice, good does not equal mediocre.",
            "Greenberg is self-indulgent, boring and very cynical (and not in a good way). The anticlimactic ending doesn't sum up the movie but rather leaves you further frustrated at Greenberg for being a miserable, unlikeable person for no apparent reason.",
            "His sharpest observations are reserved for preternaturally intelligent, hyper-self-conscious outsiders whose existential crises are the failure of the world-and, to some extent, themselves-to live up to their own high expectations.",
            "Stiller succeeds in a dramatic role but the script underwhelms with a meandering story and an unlikable lead character. ",
            "Not the feel-good film of the year, but Greenberg is a powerful account of how a few lost souls can find meaning and direction in life.",
            "Obviously there's running commentary from director Noah Baumbach -- his characters are never free of context -- but they don't have epiphanies, they don't learn and they don't apologize. It's kind of refreshing.",
            "Baumbach's writing and direction of these characters display more of a novelistic touch...but the approach produces a deeply felt view of flawed individuals.",
            "Greenberg is not an enjoyable movie, but it's a unique experience that will mostly appeal to cinephiles with insatiable appetites for character-driven small films. "

            "\"Burke and Hare\" is a waste of a good cast and a better story, as well as a hollow reminder of how John Landis seemingly has lost his touch.",
            "A droll take on one of the most notorious mass-murder cases of the 19th century.",
            "It's just scene after scene of two obnoxious people killing various other obnoxious people.",
            "All of the actors are enjoying themselves, and the movie is stuffed with history, atmosphere and vivid characters. What's in short supply, though, is laughter.",
            "To call it a black comedy is probably misleading: It's grey at best, and apart from a few scattered chuckles, it dies as quickly and gracelessly as Burke and Hare's victims.",
            "\"Burke and Hare\" is funny and dark, and full of the quick, clever humor that you'd expect from two alums of \"Spaced\".",
            "Burke and Hare is timid and dithering and blandly bad, and the new Ealing Studios seems unworthy of its inheritance, and it's all just a damn shame.",
            "Burke and Hare fails at every turn. It's a romantic comedy without jokes or romance. It's a horror film without the horror.",
            "Burke And Hare is a damning return for Ealing. It's self conscious and off putting cameos ruin the film. Full of misjudged humour, mixing immature humour with overly mature gore makes this one not funny in the slightest.",
            "Landis is too out of practice. I'm not sure 1981 Landis would have nailed it, but I know 2011 Landis doesn't.",
            "A misfire to be sure, Burke & Hare's comedic timing feels one step off, resulting in a film with solid performances and an amusing story, but not many laughs and not much replay value.",
            "Not a first-ranked film, but for fans of horror or even just comedy, BURKE AND HARE is will worth seeing.",
            "'Burke & Hare', it's all a bit Monty Python without enough Monty or Python.",
            "Landis, the master comic talent behind Animal House and An American Werewolf in London, falters with this rusty comeback, his first feature since 1998.",
            "...simply too mild - it's neither very scary nor very funny. It's not great.",
            "Expectations can be a bad thing for movies, and Burke And Hare is a good example of this.",
            "A mildly funny dark comedy with iconic British wit and tongue-in-cheek humor. ",
            "John Landis returns with a macabre spoof of Enlightenment Scotland, starring Simon Pegg and Andy Serkis as entrepreneurial serial killers furthering the cause of science...and the arts.",
            "The actors give the whole thing a sense of genial goodwill, but that's not exactly what you want out of a movie about two craven murderers.",
            "Burke & Hare offers many pleasures, chief among them the return of the Landis of old.",
            "The film doesn't come within spitting distance of vintage Landis, e.g., Animal House or An American Werewolf in London. But at least it's not The Stupids.",
            "Flat-footed, tone-deaf and finally cynical, Burke & Hare won't be sending viewers out on a comic high so much as on a wearisome low.",
            "Landis renders his Burke and Hare sociopolitically toothless and bizarrely insensitive."

            "Grim and gripping in equal parts, this unapologetically dour Norwegian drama depicts a notorious sequence of events on the icy prison island of Bastoy in 1915.",
            "An uncomfortably haunting journey to the breaking point of the human spirit, which, despite its few missteps along the will stay with you long after you leave the cinema.",

            "Touching: that's what makes Holofcener's films so lovely. They are beady-eyed satires, sure, but they're also fundamentally kind-hearted.",

            "Doesn't have much plot, just characters interacting and developing, and its lack of a need for drama is refreshing.",
            "Its conclusions are thoughtful and non-judgmental; satisfying even if it pulls a few punches.",
            "Holofcener takes pretty much everything you're not supposed to talk about at a dinner party and spins it into a ruefully awkward, bone-dry comedy.",
            "The film is more emotionally incisive than it initially appears to be, but equally it ties together a little too neatly when it already has such a concise running time.",
            "Keener never lets us lose sight of something possibly redeemable about Kate, a move which ultimately saves her performance from lapsing into an easy social caricature.",
            "Please Give isn't laugh-out-loud funny, it is witty and clever-a pleasing tale where not much happens, but spending time with the film's characters is enough. ",
            "The main problem with the film, though, is that it seems to assume that self-obsessed and charmless people are automatically interesting - just for being people. There's definitely a flaw in that logic.",
            "It's involving and often gripping with wonderful performances by a top cast, although the sum of its parts is less than the story as a whole",

            "This should be a potent combination, but it turns out to be a fizzer.",
            "The tone is lightly comic, the dialogue flirty and amusing but the performances are unengaged. There's no floor of reality, as there always was in a Hitchcock film, even his light confections. ",

            "What's not to enjoy?",
            "In a year of craptaculars, The Tourist deserves burial at the bottom of the 2010 dung heap.",
            "The chemistry is nonexistent, the supporting roles don't come any more generic, and too many laughable occasions arise from the characters laboring dramatically to be intense.",

            "[The Tourist] is very entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable from the very start and doesn't let up until the screen goes black, which is something that very few films are able to pull off nowadays.",
            "Overall an interesting and at times very gripping film, but one that perhaps could have done with taking a few more risks",
            "It's a self-conscious attempt at a Hollywood caper with the mix of comedy, romance and conspiracy watered down to the point where you can see straight through it.",
            "Depp and Jolie together create a chemical black hole. They couldn't produce sparks with dry hair and a comb.",
            "The Tourist certainly looks fabulous - as befits the setting, the stars and the gorgeous costumes . The trouble is that Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's movie is far too elegant to break into a sweat ... The viewer's pulse doesn't quicken.",
            "Something has gone really, really wrong here.",
            "I'm afraid the stars' vacation videos are probably more interesting than this poorly handled mistaken-identity caper, which isn't funny enough to be a comedy or dramatic enough to be a thriller. ",

            "An incredibly dull low-key thriller barely driven by its two A-list leads.",
            "On paper, The Tourist sounds like a dream film -- two of the hottest actors alive, in a charmingly frothy romantic crime caper set in one of the most beautiful cities on earth. So why didn't it come alive on screen?"

            "By showing how people fail to live together - in a film you could call Israel's City of God, with its sectarian-feuding story lent power and immediacy by improvisation and non-professional casting - Ajami shows how they might or should live together.",

            "The whole sad enterprise is watchable because of Kekilli.",
            "Unfortunately, Aladag was not as nuanced in her approach as her star.",
            "There are some intense, moving sequences, but too much emotional badgering and a general shortage of finesse.",
            "Aside from its conclusion, \"When We Leave'' is credible and well-observed.",
            "The movie is suffocated by its own grim determinism.",
            "...an old-fashioned melodrama with all the heightened emotions and focus on the struggles of an almost saintly heroine that you would expect from a work in that genre.",

            "It's grueling, but Kekilli is fantastic.",

            "Script problems aside, the fact that newcomer Feo Aladag has created such a strong-hearted drama, getting our attention and making us care, opening our eyes to such a senseless crime, is no small feat.",
            "Until the final scene, Feo Aladag's When We Leave is an effective melodrama.",
            "The clunky denouement reveals that When We Leave is far less than its socio-political relevance would suggest.",
            "An intense and soul-stirring German film about misogyny, tradition, reconciliation, and one Turkish woman's quest for independence.",
            "There are times when the tension lags badly and the story loses its way as Umay spins between her worlds. Still, it's a worthy start, and Aladag's distinctive voice helps the film survive any dismay.",
            "Kekilli delivers a perfectly tuned performance. Too bad the script is often clunky and melodramatic, as the first-time director, Vienna-born Feo Aladag, tries to manipulate viewers' emotions.",
            "It is frequently gripping and sincere in its intentions, but never quite as revelatory, or as devastating, as it should be.",
            "stinks of manipulation and easy resolution ",
            "Without hand-wringing, 'When We Leave' can move one to head-shaking sorrow, but also to admiration. ",
            "Aladag isn't a particularly expressive filmmaker, and she hits a few bum notes toward the end that feel more like movie payoffs than real-life drama, but she tackles this story with surprising nuance and depth."

            "As is to be expected, Weerasethakul frequently abandons the story for trancelike contemplations of nature, but never before in his work has the device felt more purposeful.",
            "While the result is pretty much the definition of a film that should be experienced, not explained, there's no sense here that Weerasethakul is being difficult for difficult's sake, or even attempting to conceal his mysteries.",
            "It playfully invokes both the lifestyle and animistic beliefs of the Northeast country folk, and the primitive magic of early Thai cinema, relating both of these to his musings on reincarnation.",
            "If you are open, even in fancy, to the idea of ghosts who visit the living, this film is likely to be a curious but rather bemusing experience.",
            "There is a singular quality to Weerasethakul's work that cannot be mistaken. He is a man with a vision, a true auteur, each film bearing his indelible stamp, a kind of hushed beauty that seems transfixed in time.",
            "Weerasethakul's intelligently-placed injections of humor prove the perfect foil to some of his the film's more melancholic scenes, successfully lifting Uncle Boonmee from the realms of despair and anguish towards hope and rebirth.",
            "No one else is making films this exciting and challenging.",
            "Leaving his traditionally bifurcated structures behind, Apitchatpong Weerasethakul plunges even further into the realm of tropical surrealism, tapping into parallel realities and past lives with a delicate restraint that is all his own. ",
            "Uncle Boonmee is art that embraces, rather than reorders, life's chaos.",
            "\"Uncle Boonmee\" is a pleasant enough experience, but it doesn't say anything and is instead content to merely project the sort of neo-Orientalism of which festival programmers and art-house patrons are so enamored.",
            "Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives is boring and completely fails to engage on any level. Simply put, it's much too strange for its own good.",
            "A film about recurrent visions and round-trip journeys: a movie not just about previous incarnations but about the possibilities of multiple and diverging paths into the future and out of the past",
            "Weerasethakul's sixth feature is a typically slowburning experience of art cinema that doesn't feature a single spoken word until eight minutes in and is as equally enchanting as it is infuriating.",
            "Uncle Boonmee is about ... the moments when our worlds expand; when our outlines turn out to be more porous than we thought.",
            "Uncle Boonmee is a film to be experienced for its immediacy and thought upon for its ineffability.",
            "Fits neatly into Weerasethakul's cinema-shaking oeuvre of beautiful experimentation. [Blu-ray]",
            "One to absorb, to wonder at, and, perhaps most significantly, to give exposure to lines of thinking that one might not be familiar with.",

            "As a first exposure to the history of The Doors I'd still recommend Oliver Stone's movie over this.",
            "The portrait of social change in Sixties America is sketchy but the film effectively states the case for Morrison as a charismatic, complex figure who lived fast, died young and left a lasting legacy.",

            "The Disappearance of Alice Creed begins with a van being stolen and ends with a different stolen vehicle being driven away. In between comes a tight, efficient thriller with just three actors and at least two whopper switcheroos.",
            "The neatness of the movie, however, hems it in. It is plotted almost to a fault.",
            "It's refreshing to see someone putting the needs of the part over her image, and this is far from a halfhearted performance. It's gritty and gutsy.",
            "There are one or two implausibilities towards the end of it all but Blakeson overcomes those with his climax. There's not a special effect in sight and no stunts either but he never lets go of the suspense. It's a rare skill.",
            "And unlike many filmmakers who make movies to take pictures, Blakeson is interested in his players. His three principals deliver convincingly messy, ambiguous performances.",
            "Like all top-notch best thrillers, The Disappearance of Alice Creed is a suspense-filled caper flick with enough twists and turns to leave the audience gasping and guessing until its final moments.",
            "Minimal, but a tense, effective suspense thriller.",
            "After meticulously rigging a combination of claustrophobic suspense drama and icy procedural, director J Blakeson allows his movie to fall apart.",
            "The cynicism of the undertaking is a little numbing, but even so it's hard not to admire the efficiency of the mechanism.",
            "While some plot developments are more plausible than others, the conclusion features one of the most nail-biting moments of the year so far.",
            "It's got the kind of writing you'd expect to find in a Hitchcock movie, with performances that measure up on every level.",
            "A kidnapping story told in simple but effective way.",

            "Tense, terse and beautifully crafted, it plays out with all the dread of a deadbolt hammering, inevitably, home.",
            "The performances are nervy and vulnerable, lifting the material when Blakeson gets caught up in a few staring contests to pad out the film. At least in the first act, there's a real sense of threat. ",
            "Sure, it's a parlour trick movie, with no great idea at its core, but props should go to Blakeson -- he's packed a remarkable amount of thrills into a one-bedroom flat location.",
            "J Blakeson's feature debut is as spectacularly suspenseful as it is deceptively simple",
            "Though The Disappearance of Alice Creed doesn't quite play out to the end, it is still a fine thriller and an exciting calling-card film for J Blakeson. ",
            "By the time the feelbad finale is in full stride, Blakeson's writing makes no sense whatsoever. However, his direction of this throttling three-handed thriller does leave a lasting impact.",
            "If you like a good twist, then this is the next film you must see. Your eyes will be glued to the screen, wondering what unexpected plot developments lay ahead.",
            "For a first time filmmaker, Blakeson shows a formidable sense of control, restraint and stylish flair reminiscent of a more established helmer and despite the odd misstep, takes the time to ratchet up the tension and intrigue.",
            "The mental games that the characters play are underdeveloped, and the look of the film isn't worth leaving home for."

            "The one and only problem I had with HOLY ROLLERS was the pacing. I found myself getting slightly bored and at times, looking at my watch. I'm sure it's not easy to mesh Orthodox Judaism and Ecstasy, but Asch did a pretty good job.",

            "This is powerful and confident filmmaking, a kind of cinematic poem that stares deep into the human soul and emerges with a quietly moving and deeply meaningful experience.",
            "The director emphasizes the fragile and invisible, the small specks of matter that make up the whole. ",
            "It's both an embrace of the comfort of ritual and certainly and acknowledgement of the magic of the unexpected and the accidental bringing change to routine. ",
            "Whose images of everyday life in the sticks makes for hypnotic viewing.",
            "Such descriptors as contemplative, deliberate, and meditative fall short of the mark in conveying exactly what's at work here.",
            "A quiet, meditative, and spiritual Italian film about the transmigration of the soul.",
            "Le Quattro Volte is cinematic slow food. It takes its time, is meticulous in its presentation, carefully considers the experience it provides, and then serves up a satisfying and nourishing feast.",
            "Yes, at times, this quiet, meditative film is lovely. At other times, it's just plain tiresome. There's an actual shot of dust particles.",
            "An intriguing, somewhat maddening intellectual puzzle film and then a hypnotic illustration of an ambiguous, unsettling thesis.",
            "Frammartino's seductive little film is poised halfway between doctored doc and artfully spare narrative.",
            "It's an odd little film, to be sure, but it does a nice job of exploring the ways in which all life is eventually connected.",
            "If you succumb to these charms, I guarantee walking out of the theatre into the noisy city will be a jarring sensory overload experience.",
            "It's a lovely piece of cinema with a striking visual sensibility, a sly sense of humour and a terrific cast of human and animal actors.",
            "Frammartino's idyll of mystic metempsychosis batters down the boundary fence between tradition and modernity, pagan and Christian, documentary and fiction.",
            "If you can separate yourself from the buzz of higher-pitch cinema, the film's beauty, wit and charm come as a breath of fresh air.",
            "It is an essay, a cinematic poem, a spiritual exploration of time and space, and it's designed to make us think and feel about the world around us and our place in it.",
            "Just watch, and wonder.",
            "Beautifully shot and featuring some highly impressive animal wrangling, Le Quattro Volte is a bizarre arthouse film that's thought-provoking, surprisingly moving and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny."

            "It successfully shows love and relationships on the opposite ends of the spectrum.",
            "It's tonally uncomfortable, which was probably Hoffman's intent, and though it's not a home run, there's great acting on display-another common theme in films adapted from plays.",
            "Can't shake off its stagey roots and lacks any emotional punch.",
            "Jack Goes Boating is an impressive display of Hoffman's work. As an actor, and director, Hoffman always recognized the power of restraint to create a memorable impression - albeit, in this case, not one that leaves behind an indelible trace.",
            "An exceptional directorial debut by Philip Seymour Hoffman, JACK GOES BOATING is a touching story about how of love is awkward, funny, and important.",
            "These characters are all writerly quirks, never once behaving remotely like recognizable human beings.",
            "Refreshingly optimistic without idealization, Jack Goes Boating gives us a fantastic cast and manages to be charming and witty without sacrificing integrity.",
            "JACK GOES BOATING is a poignant story about how love can be (often at the same time) awkward, funny, and important.",
            "A low-energy/moments of heat romance that rewards the patient filmgoer and bores the impatient one. ",
            "We do see New York from some interestingly different angles and Jack goes on a voyage which might inspire others like him.",
            "Hoffman has an intimate feel for the drama, yet he strives to open it out for the big screen with too many lyrical montages, and this occasionally blunts the more intense exchanges.",
            "The characters feel a little too condescendingly conceived as \"ordinary people\" to make this meaningful.",
            "The movie is a quirky updating of the 1955 Oscar-winner Marty, but less hard-edged.",
            "Seymour Hoffman's 'Fisher King' is far more edgy and risqu\u00e9 than fantastical, with some clumsy sexual explorative scenes ... It also has the wonderful one-on-one bromance moments ...",

            "The plot verges on incoherence, but The Sorcerer's Apprentice is entertaining enough if you can forgive the presence of Cage, whose brand of glum camp hasn't grown any fresher with the years.",
            "Cage and Baruchel fail to generate a connection and, apart from Molina's Oscar Wilde impersonation, there isn't much to laugh at -- or thrill to, for that matter, since the action has been choreographed with the nerveless competence of an arcade game.",
            "The non-stop action almost drowns out what might have been a decent screenplay...",
            "It's an enjoyable action-fantasy adventure with a sparky script; there's even a playful pastiche of the broomsticks-coming-alive scene from the original legend, using the famous Paul Dukas music.",
            "For my next trick, I will make the sequel disappear!",
            "Casts a superficial and short-lived spell.",
            "Nicolas Cage's performances have become infinitely more entertaining the more ludicrous the characters and the sillier the stories.",
            "Has virtually everything you've come to know and love from an escapist Nicolas Cage action flick.",
            "Perhaps the biggest problem with \"Apprentice\" lies in the script -- which is basically on autopilot from the opening scene.",
            "A formulaic, coincidental, not-at-all-hilarious schlock-fest that can't even be saved by some obviously spendy special effects. I'd say skip this one, unless you're curious about whether or not Cage's incredible hair weave will win some kind of award.",
            "It's a whole load of silly but there's enough fun to make this a decent slice of forgettable escapism.",
            "The Sorcerer's Apprentice wasn't bad so much as it was terribly dumb. ",
            "In a post-Potter world where fantasy flicks are ten a-penny, there is simply nothing here to make [The Sorcerer's] Apprentice stand out from the crowd. ",
            "It's strange to have a film have so much magic within and yet ultimately not have enough of the right kind of magic to make it work.",
            "drawing a line of lack-of-inspiration true and dire directly to Renny Harlin's already-completely-forgotten The Covenant.",
            "As an object to look at and be zoomed along in like an amusement park ride -- which is all it's meant to be -- this movie is pretty much more of the summery same.",
            "It also looks quite nice with some well-designed adventure moments and clean camera work that's flashy but usually elegant. But that's a few islands of interest on a sea of interchangeable marketing parts that's all sizzle and no substance.",
            "Whether intentional or not, The Sorcerer's Apprentice plays like Disney's stalled attempt to launch a stripped down Harry Potter-like franchise.",
            "The Sorcerer's Apprentice is one of those films that feels very close to being good.",
            "Frankly, it's completely dorky. And yet it slips by because of its wise decision to fully embrace that dorkiness.",
            "Light on logic, and not always polished, the film plays like a gonzo big-budget Roger Corman B-movie. It's filled with wonderfully imaginative visuals, interesting characters and spectacle galore.",
            "This PG-rated Jerry Bruckheimer production is slick as an oiled weasel: larded with fancy special effects, canned romance, corny humor and a general lack of sophistication. [Blu-ray]",
            "...a disappointingly repetitive and flat-out dull piece of work...",
            "The Sorcerer's Apprentice is a great family film that packs PG-13 excitement into a PG-rated film."

            "This conversion of garbage into humanitarian aid is just the beginning. Practical charity gives way to life-changing intimacy.",
            "The breadth of gratitude these catadores feel towards Muniz and the life-experience they undertake makes for an intelligent, emotional movie. ",
            "Waste Land is a real treasure, the sort of heartwarming and life affirming study of people, lacking in both sentimentality and cynicism, that uplifts the audience and elevates the art form",
            "Waste Land fuses the design concepts behind two of the most high-profile animations of recent years, Rio and the Oscar-winning Wall-E, into an essay about how hard some people are prepared to work.",
            "The result is a film that works on multiple levels, casting light on a worldwide problem while delivering a big jolt of human hope.",
            "It's inspiring, humbling and beautifully made.",

            "Well made and impressively structured, this is a heartwarming, genuinely inspirational and ultimately deeply moving film that has deservedly picked up an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary.",
            "Walker finds inspiration and strange beauty in the squalor.",
            "As in her memorable Blindsight, in which sightless climbers took on Everest, Walker celebrates the indomitability of the human spirit.",
            "A remarkable testament to working class lives and the unifying power of art, Waste Land is a rare thing - a film that makes you proud to be human.",
            "Compelling and vivid, it's another fine piece of work from an up-and-coming talent.",
            "A reminder of humanity's ability to transcend its surroundings through art or just plain optimism.",
            "Walker's documentary is moving, life-affirming and challenges what you think you might know about these people who pick through the rubbish.",
            "I do not mean to make their lives seem easy or pleasant. It is miserable work, even after they grow accustomed to the smell. But it is useful work, and I have been thinking much about the happiness to be found by work that is honest and valuable."

            "Galifianakis keeps the laughs coming in the hilarious, banter-filled first half, but as Due Date descends into explosions, car-chases and awkwardly inserted moments of poignancy, it loses its wit and pacing in favor of predictable stunts.",

            "Affably voiced by Christopher Plummer, Ackerley is at once enormously affectionate and beadily observan, while the clever graphic style marks the switch between straightforward narration and surreal doggy reverie.",

            "Is My Dog Tulip the best film ever about a dog? Is it Citizen Canine? My answer, yes.",
            "This is no typical \"boy and his dog\" movie, this is a joyous and warmhearted work of art.",
            "Like the book, the film is fiercely intelligent, funny, tender, and delightfully scatological. It is so thoroughly and naturally a film for adults that it makes live-action movies seem almost childish in comparison.",
            "A tender and exquisite animation about one man and his dog which gets as close to what it is to love dogs as I've ever encountered.",
            " A wonderful animated movie for anyone who's ever experienced dog ownership at its most glorious, and most embarrassing.",
            "On and on the indefatigable Plummer talks, to the point that instead of his words endearing you to the film it begins to feel more like the cinema speakers are picking up interference from Radio 4.",
            "We are treated to far too much detail about trying to house train Tulip and exactly when, where and how she relieves herself.",
            "Here's a rare beast: an animated film about a dog that resists the urge to sentimentalise or anthropomorphise its canine protagonist, yet understands the human urge to do just that.",
            "Poignant and just the right side of whimsy, it's the movie Marley & Me should have been.",
            "Unlike most celluloid tales about man's best friend, this study in dedication, defecation and reproduction sometimes feels like an intrusion into a very private affair.",
            "More Harold And Maude than Marley & Me; amusing, insightful and a little perverse.",
            "Manages to say more about man's relationship with dogs in a single, lush frame than 'Marley and Me' would if it were to run on a loop until the end of time.",
            "A delightful animation for adults, its lack of sentiment makes it an anti-Marley.",
            "A classic book, a film to cherish.",
            "As embraceable as it is, Tulip often feels as if it would have been a better animated short than a feature. ",
            "It's an oddity, this film: a wry, wobbly cartoon made expressly for grown-ups, featuring quirky hand-drawn animation and very little dialogue outside the central voiceover.",
            "Many films have been written about the bonds between man and beast but few are as wise, as witty, or as unflinchingly founded in observation as My Dog Tulip.",
            "The scratchy animation, reminiscent of Jules Feiffer's beatnik-era doodles, is a homey complement to Plummer's autumnal narration.",
            "A beautifully illustrated love letter to dogs and the people who own them..."

            "A slow burner, but the final payoff is extraordinary, leaving the characters before grappling with their inner turmoils before embarking on a very tough road. ",
            "\"Tuesday, After Christmas\" simply doesn't add anything new to the stale tale of infidelity.",

            "It might seem that Muntean is doing less work here, or avoiding choices, but he is very definitely making deliberate choices. Indeed, his choices seem to cut closer to the bone.",
            "Not every picture from a burgeoning film scene needs to be a classic, and this formerly-Communist country is proving to be fertile ground for quality cinema. Tuesday, After Christmas is a minor selection from a major movement.",
            "Emotionally complex.",
            "superb",
            "Deliberately paced drama of adultery depends on nuance and subtext, the latter holding far more meaning than the subtitles.",
            "It is faint praise to note that Tuesday, After Christmas is the most approachable of recent Romanian releases. Still, it's neither revealing nor compelling.",
            "Muntean's fourth feature is unrelentingly mundane, as if made with the sole purpose of draining the topic of adultery of any prurient interest, the kisses accompanied by smacking sounds to smother any erotic response.",
            "The strength of \"Tuesday, After Christmas,\" Mr. Muntean's fourth feature, lies in its rigorous, artful and humane fidelity to quotidian circumstance.",
            "Muntean's obsessive gaze might border on the emotionally exploitative were it not accompanied by deep empathy for the plights of all involved.",
            "The dissected minutiae of this adultery drama unfortunately doesn't add up to a very original or moving whole.",
            "Long takes with an often still camera call as little attention to Tudor Lucaciu's masterful lensing as possible, stripping down cinematic elements to their most basic and maintaining an observational stance without becoming fetishistic.",
            "There's neither glamour nor its absence, neither cinematic references nor a repudiation of them, just a soap-opera story, told with a conventionally arty craft that has neither resonance nor significance.",
            "The film's intense intimacy and acute observation work in its favor but quite enough to sustain us through the longeurs.",

            "One of the funniest, most perceptive, humane and culturally relevant documentaries in ages.",

            "A surprisingly poignant and enduring film.",
            "Steinbauer doesn't shy away from the moral queasiness of that arrangement, and that's what gives Winnebago Man a lot of its appeal -- that tension between the considerable laughter it provokes and the questions raised about that laughter.",
            "A shrewd, entertaining, fascinating and surprisingly touching documentary.",
            "It isn't perfect, but hell, neither was the Winnebago.",

            "Sex, death, and an absurdist style come together in Greek film",

            "It's a black comedy with a few exceptional scenes, but never gels together convincingly, making the artistic swing for the fences more of a quiet disappointment than a captivating leap of faith.",
            "By the time it was over a part of me couldn't help but wonder why I stuck around until the very end.",
            "It's minor, but I enjoyed it, largely because of the people on-screen, but also for the sneaky sincerity of writer-director Hue Rhodes' chronicle of one compulsive gambler's slouch toward redemption.",
            "This movie is all elbows. Nothing fits. It doesn't add up. It has some terrific free-standing scenes, but they need more to lean on."

            "Wake up this weekend and be the guest of Don Hahn, Peter Schneider and Disney at WAKING SLEEPING BEAUTY.",
            "Waking Sleeping Beauty was clearly a cathartic project for its creators, but the level of anecdotal detail (\"Then we went out for margaritas!\") comes off as self-indulgent at first and eventually just dull. ",
            "An intriguing yet uneven documentary...",
            "Carries the mystique of Walt Disney, whose animated features can be regarded as a genetic line with ups and downs as compellingly dramatic as the history of royal families.",
            "Combining honest commentary with archival footage, Waking Sleeping Beauty offers a refreshing look at a side large companies often steer clear of.",
            "[Director Don Hahn's] interviews are used as voice-over to a lively mix of Disney film clips, behind-the-scenes footage and rare home movies taken by Disney staffers.",
            "Featuring interviews with such luminaries as Tim Burton, John Lasseter, Don Bluth, Michael Eisner, the late Howard Ashman, the irascible Roy Disney and others, the film is a self-congratulatory dud.",

            "It's not one of those documentaries whose appeal stretches beyond people who are already interested in the subject, but animation buffs will eat it up.",
            "[It] may not be thrilling, riveting viewing for some, but for animation fans, and for aficionados of Disney, the movie is must-see.",
            "Instead, it's a fascinating look at how a group of talented, flawed individuals managed to pull together for a while and make some beautiful and lasting films. There's something kind of magical about that, too.",
            "Waking Sleeping Beauty will matter only to those who grew up on Walt Disney's animated films. In other words, all of us.",
            "Feature animation had an explosively great year in 2009, so it's startling to be reminded in Waking Sleeping Beauty that it was all but dead 20 years ago.",
            "It's a must-see for any Disney purist, but is also an emotive, stunningly valuable documentary in its own right.",
            "The entire story is worked into a perfect success story package, concluding right before the studios more controversial period begins, which just goes to show, you can always have a happy ending, if you know where to stop the story.",
            "Just extraordinary enough to make you really long for all the stuff that it's too-short running time and too-tight focus had to leave out."

            "A decent way to get to know a small group of New York-based musicians who have been performing together since the early 1990s.",
            "A laconic, noodling documentary, Strange Powers: Stephen Merritt and the Magnetic Fields pecks gently at that shell but makes little effort to get underneath.",
            "Strange Powers should be a cautionary cultural prognosis. Instead, it's a promotional film.",
            "I'm not sure it would be possible, or desirable, for a documentary to reveal any more about Stephin Merritt than this one does. But I would have loved to see one that revealed more about his music."

            "Uncertain which approach to use, the filmmakers try a little of everything: sit-down interviews, in-the-moment footage, sentimental close-ups. A patient, on-the-ground approach would mostly have sufficed. But the movie is fascinating anyway.",
            "For those who despair of ever seeing peace in the Middle East, Budrus offers both sobering and cheering evidence that progress is possible.",
            "What's most gratifying about Budrus is that the film enables us to feel some of the same emotions the participants experienced.",

            "Using straight-to-camera interviews and circa-2003 footage of the confrontations between villagers and Israeli soldiers, Columbia University-educated, Brazilian filmmaker Julia Bacha has made a film that will stick in the craw of hardliners.",
            "Bacha's film has a naive charm that fits well with the simple goals of the people, who were just asking that they be allowed to continue raising their kids and making a living in the place where they grew up.",
            "Simply shot and straightforward in its argument, this film from Brazilian documentarian Julia Bacha is an agitprop rallying cry for Palestinians living in the West Bank's Occupied Territories.",
            "A superlative introduction to the realities of Palestinian suffering and resistance.",
            "Budrus is passionately, more-than-competently made, but it's a civics lesson that doesn't quite shake you to your core.",
            "Closely follows remarkable story, from many viewpoints, of [a] community . . . creat[ing] an unusual paradigm for nonviolent protest . . .where most think that's impossible. ",

            "A brave and illuminating documentary about a landmark 2003 nonviolent protest movement in a small Palestinian town against Israel's Separation Barrier. ",

            "The expressive elegance of Antonioni's camera movements -- the way he glides around a scene, composing and recomposing the human figures within it to suggest psychological patterns and unacknowledged erotic connections -- still has the power to amaze.",
            "Long before the he put Monica Vitti through the existentialist-ennui wringer, Michelangelo Antonioni gave the world this muted melodrama about urban females dealing with boorish men, banal modern life and the occasional suicide attempt.",
            "An unexpected treasure.",
            "Though seldom seen now, Antonioni's fourth feature is one of his greatest films, in which diverse plot strands, character psychology, and a masterful control of the camera are perfectly fused.",

            "Lovers of the great Italian filmmaker Michelangelo Antonioni have cause to rejoice with this new-print revival of his best pre-L'avventura feature.",
            "plays like the haunting island-search centerpiece in L'Avventura in gestation",

            "Reveals a fascinating subculture that is unknown to most moviegoers, where tweens with a need for speed can spend up to 48 weekends a year behind the wheel...",
            "Even if you consider NASCAR itself a bore, you'll find this snapshot of what's often called its version of Little League compulsively watchable.",
            "Marvelously shaped and sharpened by Curry, and teeming with concentrated racetrack suspense, Racing Dreams is a splendid picture that sincerely digs into the various forces that drag this specialized four-wheeled ambition along.",
            "A fast-paced documentary with a straight away formula one storyline. From start to finish, you watch three talented kids putting pedal to metal on the track and in their lives. They're all winners! So's the film!",
            "For casual race fans, Racing Dreams is a real eye-opener. And it's a darned entertaining way to get a handle on a sport that can seem like a bunch of cars doing circles for a crowd that seems most interested in seeing that next epic wreck.",
            "Racing Dreams makes these kids into our unofficial little brothers and sister for 96 minutes, without much to note beyond their devotion to the sport. It can get a bit redundant but always remains interesting, as young lives take shape on an asphalt oval."

            "It's been five years since Gore warned us that we only have 10 years to fix global warming -- hey, Al, my apartment is near the Hudson River. Wanna bet it's still above water in 2015?",
            "Some of it sounds, quite frankly, nuts. And a few of Lomborg's enemies have said as much. But throwing tons of money at the problem with little result? That also sounds kind of crazy.",
            "By bringing in a diverse group of big thinkers to take part in a very animated, sometimes agitated, discussion, the filmmaker has succeeded in bringing what could have been a very dry mountain of data, theories and experimental research to vibrant life.",
            " Lomborg presents himself well and his intriguing material deserves a forum for further discussion.",
            "One of the talking heads that Cool It drops on the unsuspecting viewer notes with the slightly condescending chuckle of the large-brained that Gore's film, An Inconvenient Truth, was a \"great piece of propaganda.\" No doubt it was. So is this. ",

            "That this documentary is solution-oriented rather than fear-oriented as so many recent ones...have been is itself a reason for touting it.",

            "Although it contributes some intriguing ideas to the ongoing global warming discussion, this potentially controversial documentary remains too vague on several key issues."

            "After Life In A Metro, you would have thought [Anurag] Basu's considerable story-telling skills could have only have ratcheted up. But both for him, and for [Hrithik] Roshan, who comes out after three years, Kites is a good-looking disappointment.",

            "By the third act, you find the characters and story growing on you and the romance, despite the histrionics, moving.",
            "The result is a lovers-on-the-lam blast of pure pulp escapism, so devoted to diversion that you probably won't even notice the corn.",
            "Kites is, essentially, a love story. With exploding cars.",
            "Director Basu also has a tendency to backlight scenes, giving them epic, otherworldly glows that become all the more distracting with their increasing predictability.",
            "A weird fusion of romantic excess, overwrought violence and crudely-staged action, all played to the rafters, filmed in garish colors and accompanied by a bombastic background score.",

            "As a record of a time and a place in the history of New York, it's essential. As a depiction of men at the bottom of their lives, it has the same sorrowful, accusatory force as a great Depression-era photograph by Dorothea Lange or Walker Evans.",

            "Fascinating for urban and film historians, but also a moving tribute to film's timeless power to illuminate social issues. See with new The Perfect Team:The Making of.",
            "Revival of a startling 1956 film reminds us the \"good old days\" weren't so good for everyone.",
            "A vivid portrait of a New York that's long since vanished.",
            "Rogosin's famous, if underseen, landmark wades into the notorious human ruin as no other film ever did.",
            "The Bowery's reign as ground zero for drinkers and drifters may be history, but more than a half century later, the film still hits you in the gut like a shot of two-bit hooch.",

            "Equally nostalgic and fresh-faced, Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench is a bohemian musical that owes as much to Cassavetes Shadows as it does the French musicals of the '30s.",
            "Part 1940s musical, part New Wave, part cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench is a modern hybrid in the contemporary mumblecore movement.",

            "Chazelle demonstrates a stunning natural fluency in this outdated filmic grammar. It's as if he's spontaneously started writing gorgeous poetry in a long-dormant language.",
            "Shot in black and white on 16mm in a spontaneous, stripped down style, it manages to be both low key, downtown cool and exuberant at the same time.",
            "A magical amalgam of Jean-Luc Godard, Miles Davis, Morris Engel and The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.",
            "The movie is at once fresh and retro, a casual three-mumblechord affair glamorized by its exuberant nostalgia for pop bop of the late '50s and the then-new wave excitement of Shadows and Breathless.",
            "The film's visual splendor is undercut by the nagging realization that it's in the service of a tepid snapshot of happy-go-ditzy ciphers.",
            "One of the most underproduced musicals of this or any other year."

            "The Exploding Girl is a character study of one young woman - and of an entire generation struggling to maintain external maturity despite internal regression.",
            "Sometimes a carefully placed pinprick can stay with you longer than a heavier, clumsier blow, and so it is with Bradley Rust Gray's delicately done but indelible The Exploding Girl.",
            "A Zen-like experience of watchful compassion in deliberately challenging circumstances: trying to see and hear, without leaping to conclusions, the gathering troubles of a young woman living in hectic circles and with increasing self-absorption.",
            "Viewers willing to slow down their cinematic metabolism enough to watch The Exploding Girl at its own pace will find their patience rewarded by moments of great beauty...",
            "Gray has an artful, understated way of conveying what's going &#8232;on inside, often simply by focusing his camera on Kazan. And the actress has a unique capacity for projecting the complexity of feminine stillness.",
            "Builds on character emotions and the atmosphere of the city, be it in the sound of a flock of birds at sunset or just the sounds of passing cars, to create something disarmingly beautiful.",
            "In her first starring role, Kazan as Ivy vacillates wonderfully between insecurity and insouciance.",
            "Gray has successfully captured a moment in time for a young woman who is growing up and figuring out who she is, but it's not a moment for those looking to be absorbed or stirred.",
            "...a mildly watchable showcase for Kazan's undeniably impressive performance.",
            "Bradley Rust Gray's film of a young college student (Zoe Kazan) home for the summer is a portrait in interlude.",
            "Kazan has a power of her own that is as strong as or stronger than the film's style, and she can carry a scene all by herself, even if the camera is merely watching her walk down the street.",
            "Kazan has a gift for letting you see her think, even when she's perfectly still; the film's title refers to the ferocious trauma happening between Ivy's ears and her silent struggle to keep it in check.",
            "Restless audiences may itch for more plot, for the kind of fiery dramatics that typify young love in the movies, but hold the explosives: There's tender drama, too, in the possibilities of a hand-hold.",
            "\"The Exploding Girl\" can be grouped with those dreaded \"mumblecore\" movies in which young people talk endlessly about their romantic entanglements and attend terrible parties.",
            "At least director Bradley Rust Grey contains all this diverting dithering in 80 minutes -- even without an explosion, there's intrigue in watching a short fuse burn.",
            "This is a mature story about the lives of two young people (and one voice) that kept my attention from start to finish.",
            "...a lovely, languorous film that does much with little and leaves you feeling like you've witnessed some minor miracle.",
            "Gray's limpid compositions draw plangent stillness from urban darkness, counterpointing but not unbalancing his actors' understated naturalism.",
            "The Exploding Girl isn't a particularly plot driven film, but it has momentum, an undercurrent that tugs you along.",
            "Sit with it a while %u2014 which isn't hard when you're watching Kazan. The cumulative effect is powerful. You begin to feel for her even though you haven't even met.",
            "Indie down to its core , this dreary film fails to engage on many levels. The camera work is nice though, particularly when it's focused on pigeons.",
            "As a feature, it's slight; as a mood sustained by Kazan and Gray, it's impressive and occasionally spellbinding."

            "[Fresh is] made with a subtle precision that suggests a Vermeer landscape of the ninth circle of hell.",
            "This is kept alive largely through its first-rate performances, beginning with Sean Nelson's as the boy; Giancarlo Esposito is also a standout.",
            "Screenwriter Boaz Yakin makes a stunning directorial debut with \"Fresh,\" the gripping, finely acted tale of a 12- year-old's life on the mean streets of New York.",

            "It's rigorous and quite depressing fare.",
            "The strength of the piece is that it realises which aspects of its genre have been seen too many times, always coming back to Nelson's blank but expressive stare as he watches terrible things the director doesn't need to shove in our faces.",
            "The absence of moralising and macho posturing gives authenticity and poignancy to the film.",
            "A hugely underrated crime drama, Fresh is worth discovering both for its air of authenticity and Sean Nelson's remarkable performance.",
            "Fresh appeals to the head as well as the heart.",
            "Sean Nelson, who turned 13 just before the film was shot, gives a fine, self-assured performance in the title role.",
            "An unpredictable and harrowing story that works on the surface as an unconventional thriller (an intricate plot) and underneath as a powerful story of love, sacrifice, willpower and the dehumanizing cost of violence and revenge.",
            "You may not believe a minute of it, though you won't forget Nelson's face.",
            "Yakin has put some powerful drama up on the screen, and he has been assisted by no one more significantly than young Nelson, who plays Fresh.",
            "Though its morality may be controversial, the film, an impressive debut from Boaz Yakin, deserves credit for introducing a new type of protagonist, a ghetto teenager willing to do everything and anything to escape his lot.",
            "A stylish, affecting, ingeniously plotted first feature.",
            "Unlike John Singleton's by-the-numbers Boyz n the Hood, Boaz Yakin's Fresh doesn't rely on skeletal portrayals of life in the ghetto, or moralistic messages."

            "The late Spalding Gray is the subject of this conceptual documentary, which cleverly uses the actor-performer's own biographical monologues to tell his life story. It's so well-assembled that we really feel like we get to know him in the process. ",

            "As anthropological study, as a short-storylike glimpse into a character better observed from afar -- or through the lens of a jumpy digital video camera -- Douchebag is undeniably fascinating.",
            "The most provocative thing about the DIY trifle Douchebag is its title, and even that doesn't amount to much.",
            "It's a minimalist Sideways, not so much mumblecore as talkycore.",
            "The title may be mildly provocative in its vulgarity, but the most striking feature of this movie is its dullness. ",
            "The slo-mo speed bumps and hiccups indicate too much thought and emotion rather than not enough.",
            "If watching men dressed and acting like eight-year-old boys appeals to you then \"Douchebag\" might be your bag. At least the filmmakers titled it properly.",
            "A focused and mostly compelling drama with interesting characters and very natural, raw performances, but its lazy, rushed third act sinks it into mediocrity and blandness. ",
            "A Sundance favorite that falls somewhere between the mature polish of Sideways and the mumblecore scruffiness of Mark and Jay Duplass' slyly insightful The Puffy Chair.",
            "Intended to amuse younger viewers and send older ones to Urban Dictionary, Douchebag's title is, unfortunately, its most noteworthy aspect",
            " A fresh and funny exploration of the close encounter of two brothers who have been estranged from each other for two years. ",
            "An unusually eventful mumblecore road flick, the no-budget slacker odyssey Douchebag belies its abrasive title with a soft touch for two wobbly souls.",
            "Douchebag feels both rushed and way too slack, but the bigger problem is that the kind of characters and humor this movie traffics in can be found in a more compact, amusing package on the average FX show.",
            "The title certainly gets your attention.",
            "In its rushed, implausible moment of reckoning, Douchebag ends up validating the frat-boy credo: Bros before hos.",
            "It definitely packs a punch and creeps into those personal places you might not want it to explore.",
            "Dickler's acting debut is memorably repellent, even if the movie he's in -- a fitfully engaging story about two estranged brothers on a road trip -- often feels forced and unconvincing.",
            "Leave it to Sundance to program a film like this and have it not live up to its title.",
            "A clever DIY comedy that could be this year's Humpday for art house audiences in search of characters they recognize from their own lives.",
            "Director Drake Doremus' Douchebag -- a black comedy lacking somewhat in both blackness and comedy-isn't a bad film, exactly, but it is undistinguished, in the sense that its ideas and emotional payloads are both safe and small."

            "Its riveting nine hours are perhaps the most important piece of historical cinema we possess.",
            "With his 9 1/2-hour Shoah, Claude Lanzmann has accomplished the seemingly impossible: He has brought such beauty to his recounting of the horror of the Holocaust that he has made it accessible and comprehensible.",
            "By straightforwardly presenting interviews with people who lived through the Holocaust, Lanzmann makes it real again. Even more impressively, he helps us to see how the horror could have happened.",
            "Shoah is the greatest use of film in motion picture history, taking movies to their highest moral value. For what director/interviewer Lanzmann has done on film is nothing less than revive history, a history so ugly that many would prefer to forget.",
            "[It] has transcended the cinema to become a primary record of the extermination of European Jews during the Second World War.",
            "Why revisit \"Shoah'' 25 years after it was first released? Because it matters more a quarter century on, just as it will matter even more in a hundred years, and 200, and - if it and we survive - a thousand.",
            "Words can not do justice to the elegance, the importance, nor the tragedy that Lanzmann's nine hour opus encompasses. Though an overwhelming undertaking, Shoah is absolutely essential viewing.",
            "If one can stomach 9 hours of hell, Shoah is a masterpiece.",
            "When we identify with victims, we believe we see ourselves, but perhaps we are simply looking away.",
            "No other film that I have seen about the subject has haunted me as Shoah does: images and voices returning, un-asked and, so to speak, unwanted, when I wake in the night or as I play in the park with my baby son.",
            "Lanzmann`s monumental film bears significant witness to the Holocaust. Those who see it will never forget it.",
            "Putting a face on inhuman misery, this remarkable achievement demonstrates film's unique power and its underperformed duty.",
            "a magnificently disquieting experience--a harrowing descent into the depths of humanity's potential for unmitigated brutality, cruelty, and evil.",
            "It's brilliantly conceived; it's intolerable. It is the indispensable film of any year when it appears.",
            "the film's achievement is to show there are stories worth hearing, and ravaged, resilient faces that reward our scrutiny. The horror, the gallows humor, the shame and the heroism, the lessons of this holocaust -- and all others--have not been exhausted.",
            "To see these places and events described by the voices and faces of those who lived through them is immensely important.",
            "At a time when the few remaining witnesses to the Holocaust are passing away, Shoah more than ever stands as a necessary experience.",
            "takes to task largely accepted concepts of what is known, what can be imagined, and how people relate to Hitler's mass extermination with an unrivaled formal insight. ",
            "Lanzmann slowly, cumulatively colors in a vast canvas on mass murder.",
            "Viewing \"Shoah\" today proves that the Holocaust is not a discrete event, but rather an ongoing public narrative in which the movie continues to play a crucial part.",
            "'Shoah' is difficult to watch, but few other films match its consideration of unspeakable evil and indifference.",
            "The chief success of the film...is to remove the Holocaust from its comfortably horrifying place in history, and restore a human face to the atrocities.",
            "In his seminal Holocaust documentary, which runs over 9 hours, Lanzmann doesn't use archival footage, only interviews with survivors and Nazi officers. He does something fascinating, placing his aggressive presence center-stage, not to be ignored.",
            "The effect is relentless and cumulative."

            "Its rambling structure, peppered with lyrical, magical-realist asides, may not be to all tastes, but there's a sense that Gondry wants this to be more than an eccentric personal portrait...",
            "Brimming with affection and beautifully shot, but it builds a flimsy case for why it matters.",
            "This is an extraordinary film.",
            "As Mr. Gondry unfolds the story of her life, and of her inability to connect with the son she sees as weak, you can understand why it would consume a family\u00e2(TM)s interest, but you\u00e2(TM)re not sure why he thought it would pique ours.",
            "The Thorn in the Heart is interesting but never involving. It's a home movie in the truest sense - something for Michel Gondry to watch in his living room, not to play in public.",
            "This is an interesting vignette. Even if nostalgia and flights of fancy cause Gondry to lose focus.",
            "Captures the complexities at the heart of any family, with great generosity of spirit.",
            "A touching insight into a family's inner workings.",
            "We can recognize the portrait for its intimacy and appreciation of the challenges of a life lived, but it doesn't have any other real pull.",
            "(Gondry's) playfulness keeps the film buoyant even as it delves into the thickets of emotional complications of family lives.",
            "Gondry's masterful technique and subtle genre-tweaking almost make one forget that there isn't much drama to the story...",
            "Anyone can make a crappy home movie, but it takes an especially self-important one to think anyone other than their own family wants to watch it.",
            "Thorn is Gondry's most personal film, so personal as to be indulgent. But what emerges is his sincere affection for his aunt and a moving emotional experience.",
            "Stylishly filmed, [but] too slight, lazy and not nearly as moving or insightful as it could have been with more piercing and provocative interviews.",
            "Like a guest invited to a family reunion, you feel a bit uncomfortable, question why you're there and wonder how long the event will last.",
            "The movie rarely flags, but it is hard to get past the notion that what is onscreen is nothing more than an artfully made home movie and that the Gondry family saga is no more interesting than that of the average loving, if somewhat dysfunctional family.",
            "So-so documentary about filmmaker Michel Gondry's gregarious elderly aunt and her reminiscences of family and long years teaching kids in rural France. Clearly a joy for nephew Gondry and his aunt, but maybe this should have been kept en famille.",
            "The film is well-constructed, as one would expect from Gondry, but it offers little reason for anyone outside the family circle to care about dear old Tante Suzette.",
            "The film's opening -- a family dinner where favorite dishes are discussed -- suggests a liveliness that the film never fully realizes",
            "The Thorn In The Heart's home-movie-style images are frequently lovely and the film has flashes of poignancy, but Gondry never fully gets across why the specifics of this family history should interest anyone outside his circle.",
            "You can see that he meant it to be a toasty slice of nostalgia - and for Gondry, it surely is. For us, The Thorn in the Heart is more like a home movie of a family reunion we weren't invited to.",
            "Watching Thorn is like being helplessly locked out of an inside joke."

            "A unique story of love and regret...Exquisitely acted by an exceptional cast.",
            "Gay audiences -- and probably straight ones -- will see the twists coming from a mile away, but a cast this strong makes the trip worth taking anyway.",
            "While it jumps the rails at a couple of different points dramatically, Handsome Harry keeps winning you back because of Jamey Sheridan's performance. ",
            "The story quietly builds to a rueful and fraught climax in which Campbell Scott does his usual exceptional work, while Harry absorbs some hard lessons.",
            "Gordon's way with actors and with screen storytelling is as impeccable as ever.",
            "In Gordon's films, eros' capacity to disturb and disrupt is celebrated as its greatest quality.",

            "Stone has created a thrilling and timely drama, encompassing subjects from the Global Recession to the remnants of 1980's Reaganism within modern America. However, it is the film's outstanding cast that truly steals the limelight.",
            "This film misses its own story. It's a middle-brow male weepy, and no more. Money never sleeps, but you might. I can't say I didn't enjoy a little doze myself.",
            "Because the overly ambitious storyline lacks clarity, the film lacks the pulse-pounding energy of the original. What heart there is comes from the family drama among Jake, Winnie, and Gordon. ",
            "It's a perfectly fine movie that could have been above-average good but was wrecked by too much story clutter and messy editing.",
            "Often, the film feels more like a lecture than a narrative-minus the one thing that makes a lecture useful: actual information.",
            "Money Never Sleeps shows the black ice that our prosperity as a nation travels on. It's a warning straight out of Dickens but without a happy ending for the poor and comeuppance for the perpetrators.",
            "Lazy directing on the behalf of Oliver Stone, the miscasting of Shia LaBeouf and an often incomprehensible plot turn this film into a total mess.",
            "The bottom line on \"Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps\" is that it is sprinkled with inspired scenes, but is never able to fully engage the viewer because of its meandering and unfocused storylines."

            "This mind-meld of sci-fi thriller, morality play and passionate romance is worth seeing, mostly for the palpable chemistry between the lead actors.",

            "Damon and Blunt give such terrific performances you might almost forgive the movie's dopey ending.",

            "The Adjustment Bureau is that rare thing, an intelligent romance.",

            "There are plot holes within plot holes within plot holes, and although acres of raw exposition are provided, nothing ever makes proper sense. ",

            "If this is what old-fashioned means, then bring it on.",
            "Rapunzel gets a very ordinary updating in this Disney picture, raiding duller moments from the Shrek movies for ideas, and sporting a laboured selection of Broadway-style showtunes.",
            "While it lasts, the magic works.",
            "Disney has a good hair day as the revamped story of Rapunzel leaps from the screen, and not just because it's made in 3-D.",
            "At its finest moments, this production emanates the nostalgic feel of classic 2-D animated Disney films.",
            "Disney comes closer to nailing the mix of entertainment and emotional resonance that has become a trademark of the Pixar films.",
            "What the adaptation by Dan Fogelman offers is an updated rosary of the best that Disney had valued in past times. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "The highest compliment I can give the animators is at times I forgot I was watching a computer animated 3D movie.",

            "It's not classic Disney... but it is still good enough to appease families looking for a night out at the movies.",
            "For me it is a quick top 10 favorite.",
            "Tangled is a delightful rendition of a well-known fantasy that can be enjoyed by Disney animation and fairytale fans of all ages. ",
            "A welcome reminder of some of Disney's best works. The animation is exquisite, the script fantastic, and the leads all perform well. ",
            "Disney found the right combination of heart, laughs, and fairy dust to make a princess movie with the appeal of its classics and that's also right in 2010.",
            "A heroine who finds love and freedom after she loses acres of blond Barbie hair -- these days, that's a radical fable.",
            "A tight little package that sings and dances, Tangled is a well-conditioned and rather shiny little piece of entertainment.",
            "Tangled isn't perfect but having grown up with Disney cartoons, there's something quite heartwarming about seeing the studio approach past brilliance in the face of intense competition from Pixar and DreamWorks.",
            "Basically, it's the old Disney formula done with a lot more elan.",
            "The 3-D animation is ace, the blend of humour and adventure, spiced with smart songs, is great entertainment for everyone from eight to 80.",
            "The action that follows her escape is more frenetic than inventive, but the character of Rapunzel is a Disney masterpiece unto herself.",
            "It's a princess story that will enthrall the girls, an adventure tale to entertain the boys, all with enough good humor to make anybody laugh.",
            "These are timeless themes -- domineering parent, sheltered child, dangerous boyfriend -- all woven together nicely by a crew of filmmakers from the Disney-Pixar trenches."

            "Zachary Gordon, as the wimpy kid of the title, seems to be aiming for a Ferris Buehler-esque omniscience and superiority and, while he doesn't quite pull it off all the way, I was down for his struggle.",
            "A very forgettable and easily missed comedy...",
            "The characters (through no fault of the young performers) have all the personality of hand puppets.",
            " Performances from the young cast are arguably a little too slick and knowing for the naive characters they are playing, but that is often par for the course in American films these days.",
            "In an early self-referential monologue, Greg says, \"Who wants to see a movie about a kid who's stuck in middle school with a bunch of morons?\" Who indeed?",
            "All right all you 8 - 12 year olds, get in line for some fun at Greg Heffley's expense. ",
            "While the blackness of many situations resonates and despite some amusing moments, the film's tone is so ardent and realistic, it often works against it. Nonetheless, this coming of age film for the under 12 set has merit and charm",
            "The film's wry wit and understanding of childhood anxieties will remind older viewers of the television series The Wonder Years which is no small compliment.",

            "Stone is a delight, Stanley Tucci is scene-stealing as her wise-cracking father, and there are some fantastic one-liners. But the overall plot is a mess of tired clich\u00e9s, stupid characters and confused messages about sexuality and acceptance.",

            "What we get is a surprisingly funny film that has some charm to it, which is not something you hear applied to comedies all that often.",

            "A few good scenes, and a decent performance by Fabian, but standard hokum for the most part.",
            "Stamm effectively crafts a dozen or so marvellously creepy moments. Audience faith in the existence of decent horror films is reaffirmed.",
            "Ultimately comes across as a bizarre coupling of This is Spinal Tap and Rosemary's Baby.",
            "The latest entry in the pseudo-documentary horror film sweepstakes, The Last Exorcism has its terrifying moments and its silly ones.",
            "A delightful blend of intelligence and suspense.",
            "It's a mix of two horror subgenres that just works. [Full review in Spanish].",
            "The best post-Exorcist exorcism movie has arrived.",
            "The movie has sympathy for its characters, exactly the right number of twists (not too many!), a terrific final image, and-maybe most importantly-a sense that life is baffling and desperate, but not meaningless.",
            "The film is worth a look just for the buildup. The payoff may not be what most are hoping for, but it is still good enough to satisfy fans of the genre.",
            "It may seem churlish in this day and age to fault a film for being unoriginal and derivative, but unfortunately the many, many nods to The Exorcist overpowered the original, admirable elements of The Last Exorcism.",
            "I cannot emphasize enough how well-acted and gripping this film is. It may be marketed as a horror film, but it has the pacing and emotional intensity of a thriller.",
            "The film is at its most chilling, though, when considering the possibility for cruelty that is created when powerful emotions (grief, guilt) are coupled with devout belief.",
            "It all makes for interesting, and even terrifying, viewing at times. But it's not very smart and far too predictable.",
            "A bad 12 minutes before the credits is all it takes to undo the goodwill generated by a generally sturdy 74 minutes preceding.",
            "The Last Exorcism is completely boring, devoid of any scares, tension or unease and has one of the worst endings ever. Avoid at all costs.",
            "It's disappointing--if not exactly surprising--when at the halfway point the film turns into THE LINDA BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.",
            "A fairly absorbing pseudo-documentary demonic-possession flick with all the bodily contortions and jittery camerawork you'd expect.",
            "Even if you take \"The Last Exorcism\" on its own terms, you're going to be in for quite an uneventful movie.",
            "Its mature focus on characterization really sets the film apart.",
            "The seams are obvious in this faux documentary, but the thrills are fairly genuine.",
            "If you make a film about exorcism, you better be ready to be compared to one of the best films ever made. Surprisingly, the film holds its own in that regard.",
            "Does a great job of sustaining tension by distracting you with (get this) interesting characters and a novel approach."

            "This is a western wrapped up in an Abruzzo tourism brochure, but that's OK. I now know it's my favourite kind of cowboy film.",
            "The American is in fact a double-stunner - a retro-ish Euro-espionage thriller that's written, acted and directed as if it were still 1974.",
            "A lethargic work that breaks out intermittently into action and suspense, an American movie for people who don't like American movies.",
            "A lush canvas of verdant riverbanks and dim, foreboding streets at night. The anxious stillness gets under your skin.",
            "Outstanding cinematography and score and excellent acting make for a remarkable movie. The American is a must-see.",
            "That the film through these slow, poetic paces remains engrossing, engaging, and ultimately oddly affecting is a testament to Clooney's terrific performance.",
            "George Clooney delivers a strong but subdued performance in this slow-paced character study.",
            "The filmmakers seem to have forgotten that it takes more than a brooding assassin to engage the audience for the full runtime of the film. Moreover, if that character isn't involved in an interesting narrative, they'll have even less reason to care.",
            "It may not be the fast-paced assassin thriller you might expect, but it benefits more from that than anything else.",
            "When the story is threadbare and the picture lacks dynamism, all that's left is the character study but Corbijn's technique frustrates any attempt to truly get under Jack's skin. Consequently The American is often as non-descript as its title.",

            "Good fun for the last 90 minutes. Take a sandwich for the first 40.",
            "Paul Haggis handles the suspense well, supplying plenty of tense cat-and-mouse chases and harrowing encounters with denizens of the underworld and officers of the law alike.",
            "Crowe fans, perhaps more than anyone, are the most likely to be satisfied.",
            "Crowe is consistently watchable, Banks adroitly handles Lara's charm, fragility and mercurial anger and Lennie James is engaging as the beleaguered law enforcer in charge of trying to figure out what the hell is happening here.",
            "Although The Next Three Days holds a tantalising premise at its heart, the film takes an extremely long time to get to the point. ",

            "It would have been far more compelling with a stronger actress but, truth be told, the ending started off anti-climactic then concluded very predictable.",
            "This is Crowe's movie to carry and he does it with an earthy realism that reminds of the actor he is beneath the persona.",
            "The Next Three Days is kind of a throwback to the classic action movies Hollywood put out in the mid-nineties - the 'one man versus the world' era of thrillers, in which lantern-jawed heroes fight to save their family against improbable odds",
            "It's the kind of edge of your seat thriller that leaves you in constant suspense of how the situation will resolve.",
            "Managing to overcome the contrivances and implausibilities of the storyline, The Next Three Days succeeds through the sheer verisimilitude of the performances and direction.",
            "...The most effective scenes employ the Hitchcockian maxim that you can show a couple kissing for as long as you like provided there's a bomb under the bed. Haggis has plenty of bombs and plenty of beds to put them under.",
            "If it didn't feel like the movie took three days to get through, this could have been a pretty good thriller.",
