            "Borrowing liberally from War of the Worlds, 2001, Close Encounters and every other sci-fi outing this side of Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, it somehow manages to recycle these reference points and come up with something that works on its own terms.",
            "It may not be what you would call a great film, but that doesn't stop it from being the fun spectacle it was always meant to be.",
            "One quarter of a very decent albeit cliche alien invasion film, and three quarters an unwatchable adventure film.",

            "One Stiller movie I actually enjoyed.",
            "If Russell is erratic with plot and the slightest bit smug in attitude, he makes up for these flaws by drawing fun, inspired performances from his ace cast.",

            "Zesty chases and Van Damme's always exciting fights scenes fit well within a story that carries more intrigue than the average kick-and-crash extravaganzas.",
            "The plot moves along so that a mandatory fight scene is sure to pop up every fifteen minutes to make sure the audience isn't snoozing, but Lam manages to botch at least half of these scenes with shaky camerawork and scrappy editing.",
            "From start to finish, Maximum Risk presents spectacular stunts choreographed and coordinated by Charles Picerni and some hair-raising, stomach-churning automotive chases attributed to Remy Julienne, the French master of the art."

            "If Minghella's debut feature Truly, Madly, Deeply was overrated -- a Ghost for the NW3 set -- this movie is a quantum leap towards cinema's potential for magic.",
            "You can take your brain to The English Patient and you will not be insulted. Your eyes will not be offended either. This scarcely makes Minghella's film the best in the world; it just makes it loom large.",
            "Its wit, sophistication and artistry never are at odds with the fundamental pull of a powerful love story that out-Zhivagos Doctor Zhivago because it respects love's mysteries, admits it doesn't know the heart's boundaries.",
            "Relentlessly beautiful, but not quite stupifyingly so",
            "It took a filmmaker with Anthony Minghella's vision to even attempt an adaptation of Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient. And it took a filmmaker with Minghella's talent to pull it off.",
            "Could this possibly be the Casablanca of the late 20th century?",
            "Epically romantic stuff, with a welcome dose of modernism mixed up in an intriguing mystery.",
            "Minghella doesn't so much adapt the novel as he translates it wondrously to a different medium, with its mysteries and passions intact. ",
            "...a deliberate, lengthy but always fascinating film...",
            "Whenever the movie's design seems too elaborate, too remote, it's the rare detail of these performances that redeems it.",
            "Its performances are finely crafted with loving care.",
            "This is a radical adaptation which transposes, re-assembles and deletes key elements of the novel to achieve a pure cinematic reinvent ion that is admirably adroit - and as distinctive a work of art as the book remains in its own right.",
            "...a beautiful film. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "Probably untranslatable to the screen. The English Patient is a noble try. But still a bore.",
            "It is, after all, quite a lot of movie, two hours and 42 minutes' worth, and the more movie you have, the greater the chances that not all of it will work equally well.",
            "Anthony Minghella believes in ghosts -- and, at his best, makes believers out of viewers, too.",
            "It's the sort of solemn production that is often mentioned as an Academy Award contender.This says less about the quality of the film than it does about its self-consciously lofty tone and its sense of self-importance.",
            "It's a tragically lovely story about the cruel devastation of selfish and ungoverned love. It's also one of the best movies in a long, long time.",
            "It's an ambitious film and director Anthony Minghella's skill lies equally in his screenplay, which delivers explanation only in fragments but keeps us involved for what is an epic running time.",
            "As a love story and an adventure story, The English Patient is the fastest, most powerful two hours and 40 minutes this year. It's terrific.",
            "The English Patient is a modern movie that breathes vivid new life into the cliches of old-fashioned motion pictures, recalling a time when movies were graceful, complex and leisurely.",
            "The English Patient's considerable pleasures are chiefly aesthetic, not emotional.",
            "This World War II romantic drama has the epic feel of classic cinema.",
            "The film doesn't gather the emotional momentum that would make it compelling as well as impressive."

            "There are pain and honor in [Neeson's] performance, and they constantly rise up to redeem a film that is less probing, less thoughtful than its director's claims and aspirations for it.",
            "Intelligent, enormously accomplished and seriously problematic, Neil Jordan's ambitious account of the activities of arguably the central figure in Ireland's painful, bloody fight for independence from the British Empire has a great deal to offer...",
            "This is Jordan's most ambitious and satisfying movie -- a thriller with a real sense of scale, pace, menace and moral import.",
            "Played with great magnetism and triumphant bluster by Liam Neeson, the film's Michael Collins easily lives up to his nickname.",
            "Michael Collins really is Irish history told on a bold, sweeping, comprehensible scale; in a sense, it's almost Irish history Hollywoodised.",
            "Bad history perhaps, but Neeson's performance borders on the brilliant.",
            "While the film is unflinching in its depiction of the brutality of both the English and the Irish, Jordan pointedly dissociates his hero from any actual ugliness.",
            "Neil Jordan uses very broad and movie-ish strokes to paint his portrait of the busy, eponymous hero.",
            "Be sure to watch \"The Wind That Shakes The Barley\" if you watch \"Michael Collins\"",
            "A bold and rousing historical epic.",
            "An intellectually well thought out work that presents the events of those turbulent days in Irish history with clear, vivid reality, from costumes to sets to location.",
            "Neeson's a force of nature in Neil Jordan's near-excellent historical epic.",
            "Instead of being a slow, dull historical drama, it is actually an exciting action drama.",
            "A way to relate pivotal events to an audience who probably knows little about the Irish republic's creation.",
            "Michael Collins is more-or-less accurate, but being accurate and giving a complete picture of the Irish Troubles are two different things."

            "This isn't the supreme masterpiece it might have been, but Nichols's direction is very polished and some of the lines and details are awfully funny.",
            "If The Birdcage isn't exactly the Mike Nichols-Elaine May movie of our dreams, it does manage to transform what was formerly a campy bit of French fluff into one of the loopiest, most hysterical family-values movies ever made.",
            "The Birdcage is a scream.",
            "It doesn't so much champion diversity as celebrate conformity.",
            "The dialogue is sensational, the cast is perfect, the directing is sharp (by celebrated filmmaker Mike Nichols), the music is snazzy, and the film concludes quite cleverly.",
            "While the film occasionally drifts into stereotypes, they are typically rather harmless and Williams and Lane play off of each other perfectly. ",
            "If you haven't seen Birdcage, check it out on video, or better yet, get gussied up and see it in a theater. Either way, realize and appreciate the very symbolic general public acceptance of the transgender phenomenon (and YOU) this film represents. ",
            "The Birdcage grossed nearly $200 million worldwide in 1996, and that is significant. Box Office Mojo says it's the highest grossing queer film of all time, though they're not counting Frozen and 300, and they probably should. ",
            "Campy, comedic romp with lots of profanity.",
            "Robin Williams plays off of a flaming Nathan Lane with delicious understatement and anchors a farce that moves along at a brisk pace-with or without heels.",
            "At its core, it is about human relationships. They're extreme relationships, and they're cross-wired to get an electric reaction, but they're real characters nonetheless.",
            "What might be a surprise, given the talents involved, is how relentlessly unfunny it is.",
            "Colourful, camp, beautifully acted and brimming with gags, Mike Nichols The Birdcage sits comfortably in Hollywood's canon of unchallenging, 'It's OK to be gay' films.",
            "Shows no reason why it had to be made again.",
            "If you like to laugh and laugh hard, don't miss this one. It's a genuine hoot.",
            "Broadly funny, with solid performances all around.",
            "Birdcage does a remarkably good job of delivering a movie that puts its own decided spin on the tale.",
            "[Not] nearly as funny as it has been made out to be."

            "These escapist showdown movies are only as good as their villains and heroes. The heavies here are more of those ubiquitous gung-ho military types who are due to be dishonorably discharged from further cinematic duty.",
            "Here's a surprise tucked into the languishing days of summer movies. Arriving with hardly any attention is a satisfying, even fun, action picture about a futuristic soldier named Solo.",
            "Since the hero and the villains are equally mechanical, the big, loud battles are as exciting and suspenseful as watching people play Mortal Kombat for 90 minutes.",
            "Solo is at least instructive as a miscellany of action movie cliches in one neat and depressing package.",
            "The best one can say for Norberto Barba is that he directs a slick piece of goods. But no amount of fast cutting or tempo can disguise the material's simplistic, thoughtless nature.",
            "It doesn't disappoint when it comes to blowing things up, discharging firearms, and giving Solo an opportunity to dish out payback to his brutal squadron of superior officers.",
            "An altogether nonsensical bit of action/sci-fi garbage that marries a dreadful script with hilariously chintzy action.",
            "He's The Terminator's distant cousin. He's Solo, and he's jerrybuilt from parts of so many other movies that it's hard to recognize a single original element in this android-warrior saga with Mario Van Peebles in the thankless title role.",
            "There are too many moments of unintentional comedy caused by the ropey macho dialogue and the hammy performances of bad guys William Sadler and Barry Corbin.",
            "Solo contains the usual shoot-'em-ups, an undistinguished performance from Van Peebles, plus lots of crummy dialogue.",
            "Mindless entertainment for the end of the summer, with emphasis on the mindless.",
            "It simply plods along to it's inevitable, uninvolving and pretty uninteresting end.",
            "Silly action yarn furthering the demise of van Peebles.",
            "It's not a great film, but it is a little above average.",
            "The film ends up having more laughs than a comedy."

            "In the end, \"The First Wives Club\" even betrays its own bylaws. Revenge is a dish not served. Did Thelma and Louise make their sacrifice for nothing?",

            "It's not much more than a variation on Nine to Five, with the object of revenge switched from a single boss to multiple husbands.",
            "Although the movie presents itself as a ''hear me roar'' feminist statement, its view of humanity - both male and female - is so sour and artificial that the women characters come off almost as badly as the men do.",
            "Yet the real genius of this saga of sisterhood ascendant is its, um, marriage of revenge fantasy and exuberant spirit.",
            "These three powerhouse comediennes toss up a fairly delightful mess.",
            "First Wives Club is something Hollywood hasn't produced since 9 to 5 some 16 years ago: a film exhilaratingly woman-positive and funny.",
            "For better or worse - more better than worse, though -The First Wives Club is peak 1990s feminist cinema.",
            "Smart and sassy, \"The First Wives Club\" is funny enough to amuse even the second wives.",
            "The dialogue is often silly but Bette Midler, Diane Keaton, and Goldie Hawn deliver it with enough crackerjack energy to keep audiences laughing.",
            "Ultimately First Wives Club fails as a piece of feminist film-making just as miserably as it does as Hollywood entertainment. ",
            "Those in seach of a classic adult comedy -- a latter-day version of \"The Women\" -- are urged to join the \"Club.\"",
            "[I]f you're expecting any savour of fin de siecle feminism more bracing than that peddled in, say, Nine to Five (which has much the same fundamental revenge premise), you'd be better off perusing the writings of Gloria Steinem.",
            "Starting over the top and wildly working its way upwards, The First Wives' Club eschews subtlety at all costs and is dogged by a number of out of place syrupy songs on the soundtrack.",
            "But despite the clever jabs, and even with cameo support from Ivana Trump and Gloria Steinern, the film's three stars still seem trapped by Hollywood formula-choked by the heavy-handed direction of Hugh Wilson, and a smarmy script by Robert Harling,",
            "The awful thing about this movie is that its stars, three of the best comic actresses in Hollywood, are reduced to bimbos too.",
            "Terrific stuff.",
            "While the movie frequently gets things right, the big intricate revenge set-up in the second half is mishandled and muddled.",
            "And as just this, a simple vehicle for feminist rage, \"The First Wives Club\" is effective. The trouble is that the opportunity was here to say so much more.",
            "It pretends to sympathize with dumped women and displaced homemakers everywhere, but given these gals' level of obvious affluence, membership in ``The First Wives Club'' is quite exclusive.",
            "Sisters are doing it for themselves. But what they're doing is obsessing about men, which greatly undermines this purported comedy of female empowerment.",
            "There are enough good laughs to make even the frantic second half palpable.",
            "The First Wives Club is one of the few films made for a female audience in which its characters find fulfillment not by shacking up with a man, but by moving on from partners that don't deserve them.",
            "The First Wives Club has all the conviction a comedy of female vengeance needs. But as soon as the dumb plot takes over, the wit leaks out of the movie like helium from a balloon."

            "It's a broad historical saga of great warmth, but it would have been more convincing if it didn't have \"feminist agenda\" stamped all over it.",
            "Antonia is a work of rare lyricism. It glows with the light of a Flemish painting and the spirit of magic realism.",
            "Antonia's Line is enjoyable because it is never preachy. It depicts, with a painterly eye, a pagan world that has not changed since Breughel.",
            "The performances are modest and appealing. In the title role, Van Ammelrooy projects a remarkable combination of optimism, strength and resignation.",
            "It glides so easily over a multitude of events and characters that we're never jarred; Antonia and Bas make a winning alternative-community grandma and grandpa.",
            "I didn't much take to this humorless, Oscar-winning 1995 feminist fable.",
            "The most energizing, uplifting, woman-positive film I've ever seen.",
            "[Antonia's Line] ultimately evolves into a familial epic covering three generations of independent women. It is fine storytelling.",
            "There are a few moments of grating sentimentality, but these are balanced with a quirky humour and a mildly daring unpredictability.",
            "The movie is so pastorally lovely to look at, its characters so likable and its lulling rhythms so soothing that it's easy to forget that it's a lot of pleasant, plotless hooey.",
            "A hamfisted feminist parable.",
            "Antonia's Line perfectly fits the Oscar mold: set in the past, studiously PC, sentimental, multigenerational, and loaded with hollow ruminations on the nature of life, death, and the passage of time.",
            "The movie has the feel and flow of magic realism, and brilliant performances by Willeke van Ammelooy as the Earth Mother Antonia and Els Dottermans as her lesbian daughter are extremely vivid.",
            "Morbid and overwrought.",
            "Poignant and pertinent, perhaps, but ultimately somewhat self-satisfied.",
            "Beautiful, tender, hearty and poetic.",
            "Antonia's Line is a Dutch treat that unfolds like a generous novel, surrounding you with its indelible sense of time, place and character.",
            "In the title role, Van Ammelrooy provides a strong center to the rambling story, both feminine and authoritative.",
            "Antonia's Line is a masterpiece. I say that even though I found the first 10 minutes ho-hum. By the time the movie was half over, I was hoping it would never end.",
            "Harsh and gentle, sensual and intellectual, wise-ass and heartfelt -- it's a full package.",
            "A vibrant saga, from the firebrand writer/director of A Question of Silence, combining feminist rigour with an involving dynastic narrative.",
            "An amateurish, self-conscious film with a ham-fisted message.",
            "Can women live happily without men? This is the question posed by the Dutch director Marleen Gorris in her idealized feminist fairytale about one independently minded woman and her family.",
            "This is a world we rarely see on film, and Gorris brings it vividly to life. Where she goes wrong, however, is in romanticizing the cock-eyed feminist Utopia that the farm becomes."

            "I don't mean to dismiss Dead Man as worthless, or meaningless. Jarmusch just happens to express himself in a deadpan manner that just happens to have no appeal for me whatsoever. Of course, I only say this because he is an \"artist.\"",

            "In this movie, Jarmusch displays an uncanny knack of having absolutely nothing happening on the screen for long periods of time, fading to black, and then coming back with still more nothing.",
            "When Dead Man is imagining the Wild West as an infernal landscape of death, it is furiously alive. When it tries to reflect on those images, it begins to nod out.",
            "I liked the film at its original length, and I think the shortened version is Jarmusch's best movie. ",
            "Blake and Nobody meander through a wilderness as shrubby and nondescript as a '50s B horror movie, all to the accompaniment of an echoey Neil Young guitar score that sounds like something Wayne Campbell made up in his basement. ",
            "Dead Man is surprisingly bland. And it becomes more dull -- and more grotesque -- as it moves along.",
            "Dead Man is a strange, slow, unrewarding movie that provides us with more time to think about its meaning than with meaning. ",
            "Beautifully shot in high contrast black-and-white, Dead Man fails not because of any one particular flaw, but instead stumbles, caught in a quagmire of metaphysical constructs and Western lore.",
            "What was obvious in 1995-and the last quarter century has made increasingly clear-is that Dead Man, aside from merely being a quiet masterpiece, is one of the best American films of the late '90s.",

            "I won't pretend that Jarmusch's austere poetry will speak to everyone...No matter. This strange, mystical Western is his most daring work -- his best since Stranger Than Paradise."

            "For many, a little of this joking will go a long way; devoted fans, however, will wish for a double-bill. Count me closer to the latter group.",
            "There are still enough bad makeup jobs, pretentious lines, and coy sexual situations to give the chattering puppets plenty of fodder.",
            "If you're in the mood for some knuckleheaded comedy at the expense of -- in mad scientist Dr. Forrester's words -- \"a stinky cinematic suppository called This Island Earth,\" then get thee to some place playing MST3K.",
            "It's a fun enough way to pass the time. And fans of the TV version of MST3K certainly won't be disappointed. But it would be just as much -- if not more -- fun watching it in your own living room with a bunch of rowdy pals.",
            "[MSTies] can rest assured that the movie is about as funny as a typical episode of the show that is, pretty darn funny in a sly and satirical sort of way. For others, the movie can serve as a good introduction to the whole MST3K phenomenon.",
            "As the gags pile up remorselessly, and the viewer strains to keep up with the story line and the cutting subtext, a furious but benign apnea takes hold. You can't enjoy a good long laugh because you'll miss too much.",
            "Few films empathize quite so passionately with their audience.",
            "Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie is about a third as funny as it thinks it is. Still, that's pretty funny and about twice as funny as most American comedies these days.",
            "The show provides a prodigious number of giggles, and it's so short (well under 90 minutes) that you'll have plenty of time to rent the original This Island Earth and test out wisecracks of your own.",
            "The film is a vindication of bad taste, and of the principle that mocking well is the best revenge.",
            "Fans (O.K., MSTies) will find new and larger sets and slightly better special effects.",
            "The incorporated tale of large-craniumed alien scientists, bug-headed mutants and a heavily mascaraed heroine in a pointy-brassiered jumpsuit proves fine fodder for the MST3K writers and performers.",
            "This may only be a moderately funny example of the movie-spoofing series, but this MST3K feature is still the funniest movie to appear in theaters this year. ",
            "Mike and the droids are adept at poking fun at the bad movies they're forced to watch by evil scientist Dr Forrester (also played by Beaulieu), though This Island Earth is cut above the vast majority of films featured on the original TV show.",
            "You have to love Best Brains for doing their best to reward the fans. ",
            "This Island Earth is actually a GOOD movie ... For the first (and last) MST motion picture, the honor should have gone to a universally acknowledged turkey like Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster or Ed Wood's immortal Plan 9 from Outer Space.",
            "The good news for fans is that MST3K: The Movie, for all its flaws, at least works as an okay facsimile of the real thing.",
            "You still feel that every delirious allusion, every snidely on-the-mark observational quip, is tickling a different part of your cerebral cortex. Yet the movie lacks the manic highs of the show's best episodes.",
            "[The wisecracks], more often than not, don't go over. But those that do still add up to lotsa laughs, and the sheer weight of them eventually builds an atmosphere of mild lunacy that it's useless to resist.",
            "The TV show might be funnier but this is pretty solid introduction to the MST3K phenomenon.",
            "In the theater, whenever Mike, Crow or Tom Servo flub a punchline or resort to a fart joke, you almost want to lean forward and shush them.",
            "The translation is a little bumpy, but this is Mystery Science Theater we're talking about here: even a less concentrated effort is guaranteed to be a pants-wetting night of endless laughs and infectious bad movie grimacing.",
            "As we were saying to Andy Rooney the other day, don't you just hate it when you go to see some old movie and find the front two rows filled with college students who think they're extremely clever and don't care who knows it?",
            "So, how does movie differ from TV show? The answer is, thankfully, not a lot."

            "Wong made Chungking in just 23 days, and the film's mad-dash energy is nicely reflected in his quartet of stars. Wong, himself a star of cinema's future, has already shown that he possesses a uniquely '90s voice, eye and spirit.",
            "Wong's singular frenetic visual style and his special feeling for lonely romantics may remind you of certain French New Wave directors, but this movie isn't a trip down memory lane; it's a vibrant commentary on young love today, packed with punch.",
            "Wong's dreamlike tone and Doyle's stunning cinematography make this strange love story a joy to watch.",

            "Neither of the movie's two stories makes complete sense, but that hardly matters. This is like being inside a pinball machine with a toddler at the controls.",
            "Quentin Tarantino and Xavier Dolan are just two of the directors who've worshipped at the altar of Wong Kar-wai. Chungking Express remains the best reason why.",

            "Despite the liveliness of Chungking Express's first half, it's this second story that catapults it into the company of Wong's best films."

            "A confident, eccentric debut about a trio of shambling and guileless friends who become the Candides of crime, Rocket feels particularly refreshing because it never compromises on its delicate deadpan sensibility.",
            "[Bottle Rocket] meanders pleasantly, like a road movie, with a seventies-style, anything-goes offhandedness that whisks the audience through the rough spots.",
            "Bottle Rocket was conceived as a low-budget family affair -- it has more Wilsons than the Beach Boys -- and outside of a few cult-intensive pockets of fandom, that's where it's likely to end up.",
            "This is a movie about friendship, about foolhardy endeavors that get your adrenaline going and make you feel life buzzing in your toes. Written with wit and concision and remarkable confidence, Bottle Rocket is a joyride worth taking.",
            "Bottle Rocket is a beguiling surprise, a terrific little movie comedy about a slightly addled gang of young criminal wannabes.",
            "It's only in the finale of Bottle Rocket, brimming over with poignant male self-delusion, that the flair and sizzle of Anderson's future promise returns.",
            "This deliciously offbeat comedy gets much of its oomph from a loopy screenplay and lead performances that can only be called hilariously bland, or is it blandly hilarious?",
            "Like the cheap pyrotechnic of the title, Bottle Rocket neither goes very far nor ends with a bang, and that's part of its charm, originality and delight.",
            "Bottle Rocket may not be profound work, but it shows off some genuine talent both behind and in front of the camera.",
            "This is a small movie of raffish charm, similar in feel and tone to last year's independent hit The Brothers McMullen.",
            "Anderson's debut film is a small-scale delight.",
            "With a wild-card character like Dignan, he could be either the most original character in many a moon -- or never convincing. Wilson, with his cockeyed grin and rapid-fire delivery, comes off as a young Dennis Hopper.",
            "Wes Anderson's 1996 first feature (before Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums) is fresh, character driven, often funny, and unfashionably upbeat (as well as offbeat).",
            "The title refers to cheap fireworks that fizz before they flame out quietly, and that's what three Southwestern slackers do in this amiable heist movie-cum-road flick.",
            "Even as you laugh at these guys, you feel an overwhelming sympathy for them. Sensing that they love each other, you want their dumb, dysfunctional lives to work out.",
            "Caan does a funny cameo as the local crimelord but the film belongs to Anderson's co-conspirator Wilson, whose wired performance leaps off the screen.",
            "[An] agreeably eccentric comedy crime drama.",
            "A lot of the script has the ring of authenticity if only because all the private jokes and references that pass by are plainly embedded in the real lives of the creators.",
            "This is Anderson still finding his feet, but the steps and swagger are confident.",
            "It's a little chaotic but director Wes Anderson and his young stars Owen C. Wilson (who co-wrote with Anderson), Luke Wilson and Bob Musgrave have a gift for the human comedy.",
            "The first Anderson/Wilson offbeat, talky comedy.",
            "Full of surprising warmth and charm, unexpected plot turns and droll characters that bounce off each other in refreshing ways, this genre-defying Columbia pickup may struggle to overcome its lack of an obvious marketing handle.",
            "If Bottle Rocket is to be remembered for anything in Anderson's body of work, it should be as the film that gave the director the power and name recognition to continue making the films he wanted to make."

            "A layered conundrum that builds to a stunning crescendo, Mathieu Kassovitz's Hate is an extremely intelligent take on an idiotic reality: the mutual mistrust, contempt and hatred between the police and France's disenfranchised young citizens.",
            "One of the most blisteringly effective pieces of urban cinema ever made",
            "It cuts deeper and shows us the foolishness of its characters as it mourns their inevitable tragedy.",
            "Writer-director Mathieu Kassovitz mines so much tension and pointed dialogue from a low budget and deceptively simple premise that you wonder why so much of current Hollywood's own social realism ends up shooting $50 million blanks.",
            "Starkly funny, politically poignant, and extremely honest in its social portrayal, it endures as one of the greatest films of the 90s. ",
            "One of the most important films of post-war French cinema.",
            "The young men may be cut from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds (Jewish, Black and Arab) but are united in their impoverished station and palpable frustration.",
            "It was a seminal film then, it's a seminal film now.",
            "A really charged, pulsating film shot in gorgeous black and white, and it still really holds up.",
            "Mathieu Kassovitz's account of police brutality is as ferocious a punch in the stomach as it was twenty-five years ago, and retains every spark of an explosive deconstruction of France's treatment of minorities and widening social inequality.",
            "Unlike most films of the '90s, Matthieu Kassovitz's La Haine remains a timeless snapshot of a transitory decade that forever transformed world history.",
            "Well the setup may be a little plot-convenient... but sophomore director Mathieu Kassovitz (Cafe au Lait) has turned out a film that manages to be documentary-like and stylish at the same time and is certainly one to watch.",
            "La Haine chucks a Molotov cocktail through the sedate window-front of modern French cinema. Kassovitz has scoured away the layers of nuance and the portraits of a privileged past -- and daubed over them slogans of despair that are raw and contemporary.",
            "Mathieu Kassovitz's gritty, documentary-like second film is a powerful comment on class and racial disparity.",
            "La Haine does not provide an easy answer. So you have to struggle intellectually for yourself.",
            "The conveniently manufactured ending is a let-down, but the display of raw emotion and kinetic energy lingers with the viewer long after the film is over.",
            "An inspired achievement from Mathieu Kassovitz.",
            "to get an inside view of the situation, there simply is no better source than Kassovitz's disturbing urban study",
            "One would expect, from the initial look and feel, that this is a skin-head flic. It is so much more complex, though, covering a gammut of social strata within strata.",

            "Doesn't go much past its gimmick, but it marks Salwen as a talent worth watching.",

            "Anyone who thinks that Josh Hartnett isn't a true movie star should see his riveting, high-wire performance in August, a shrewdly dramatized look back at the bursting of the dot-com bubble.",
            "Smartly scripted, convincingly atmospheric morality fable in which Hartnett, usually insubstantial as a good guy, plays a convincingly flawed character galloping toward the precipice.",
            "Only an amusing cameo by David Bowie enlivens things, but he's onscreen for just about two minutes at the end.",
            "There's not much to it, but Austin Chick's hyper-focused indie does serve as a nicely assured showcase for lead Josh Hartnett.",
            "Has a dark desperation that\u00e2(TM)s morbidly compelling. But the movie\u00e2(TM)s amoral momentum is fatally slowed by an acronym-heavy script and flimsy characterizations that offer fine actors...little to play.",
            "August is a brooding, boring indie drama about the death of the culture-wide hallucination that was the dot-com bubble, and the moment when countless dot-com millionaires on paper became real-life paupers.",
            "This one has nothing extraordinary about it to compensate for seven years' staleness.",
            "A movie that makes a good initial public offering.",
            "If you want to see ignorant self destruction, see Troy Duffy in \"Overnight\" and forget this film---the worst mistake Josh Hartnett has made in his career.",
            "While this modest indie offers high-tension plotting, it's real substance is the contrast between Hartnett's charismatic, hard-charging business persona and his intimacy-challenged real-life relationships.",
            "...the picture ... provides Josh Hartnett with one of his most interesting roles, and it elicits one of his sharpest performances.",
            "This stylish, well acted drama chronicles one once-successful dot-com's efforts to stay afloat in the wake of the Internet boom's bust.",
            "all gloss and pizzazz but mostly pizz and no azz.",
            "Merely serves to watch a company's ashes fall without really considering what started the fire.",
            "August seems to be missing something essential -- a prologue? Or maybe it's not what's missing that's the problem, but what's here.",
            "Rodman's potentially intriguing idea about the 2001 crash of the dot-com biz just months before 9/11 is poorly executed by helmer Chick (XX/XY), who doesn't take full advantage of his star cast, headed by Josh Hartnett, Naomie Harris and David Bowie.",
            "A procession of anger mismanagement protagonist episodes of rude behavior with assorted unbelievably receptive babes, and a glutton-for-punishment old flame (Naomie Harris) whom he manages to re-con into bed, before she wises up all over again.",
            "Hartnett does windbag cockiness well, yet the overriding conception of his character and the Dot Com phenom in general is so straightforward and unrevealing that his effort goes for naught.",
            "The direction by somebody called Austin Chick gives the appearance of being phoned in from an Internet bar in another town.",
            "The actors are not well supported by Howard A. Rodman's self-satisfied script, which would rather tell than show, relying at several points on long, smug speeches that bring the narrative to a grinding halt.",
            "This middling drama has no glaring faults, but simply lacks the intended urgency. There's scant sense of surprise in a narrative trajectory that feels preordained.",
            "The worthwhile attempts at creating realistic character dynamics and situations within a very specific era in New York is notable for sure.",
            "August doesn't make a lot of sense nor does it seem to have a message or point."

            "I don't know if the lawyers are currently scanning the contracts for Striptease in order to find out what went wrong in the small print, but someone got badly conned; and that someone is mostly the audience.",
            "Yet another case of the star's salary being much more interesting, and exuberantly vulgar, than anything the screen reveals.",
            "The Striptease script... is at a loss for any kind of drama between Moore's dances. Not for a second do we care about her as a mother, wife or working woman. ",
            "The film's premise is thinner than the heroine's G-string.",
            "Bergman, who made The Freshman and Honeymoon in Vegas, provides quotable one-liners for everyone (especially Rhames), and a bevy of strippers lend colorful albeit stereotypically ditzy support.",
            "Men will doubtless be lured to Striptease by Moore's beautifully sculpted body. But it's the heart she puts into Erin that gives this more erratic than erotic picture the centering presence it needs.",
            "Slack stuff.",
            "Striptease is not a disaster like that other expensive ecdysiast extravaganza, Showgirls, though if it were, it might at least have some redeeming camp awfulness to enliven its otherwise dull mediocrity.",
            "For all its matter-of-fact nudity and wealth of silicon-heavy exotic dancers, the film lacks any palpable sense of eroticism.",
            "Although the movie is a bit too long, oddball humor and a likable cast keep it entertaining.",
            "Striptease is an amiable comedy with ambitions to be a satire, but its thriller plot keeps getting in the way of the yucks.",
            "Andrew Bergman's direction makes it watchable, but his screenplay pulls its punches on the sleaze, and tear-jerking sentimentality and inadequate humour don't combine well with the drama.",
            "If you get stuck at Striptease, my advice is to relax and try to enjoy its occasional pleasures.",
            "Writer-director Andrew Bergman presents [Moore] as a rather abstract object of desire. He wants us to know that his mind, at least, is not in the gutter--can't afford to waste time there, given the amount of busy work he has to.",
            "The result is a perversely odd concoction: a comedy that has fun with everything but stripping -- which, post-Showgirls, would seem to wear the biggest bull's-eye.",
            "Striptease stinks. Yes, that's a crude, perhaps even rude, assessment. But crude and rude are the two terms that sum up this alleged comedy.",
            "This may sound like a suspense movie, but it's not. There's no mystery (we know who the bad guys are) and the damsel-in-distress angle generates zero tension.",
            "The Fort Lauderdale setting imparts little flavor or atmosphere, and the same goes for the flagrantly unerotic dances.",
            "Kinda made me homesick for Showgirls.",
            "Moore, the most overrated star since Comet Kohoutek, is dreadful, dreadful in this thoroughly disappointing film version of Carl Hiaasen's hilarious novel.",
            "Moore doesn't realize that she's supposed to be making a dark comedy; instead, she seems to be auditioning for the role of Mrs. Cleaver.",

            "The \"set\" pieces of this film come off like clockwork, but there's no connective tissue -- no story line, no solid characterization, etc. In the end, De Palma's work seems full of sound and visual fury without signifying much of anything.",
            "De Palma has a choppy, episodic sense of story, and he crafts individual scenes rather than telling a single unified story.",
            "The most dour, sexless piece of escapism in memory.",
            "Unlike most action films, Mission: Impossible's distinct appeal operates not so much on suspense but on improbability.",
            "Despite the snags, De Palma remains a virtuoso puppet-master, pulling the strings taut in a nail-biting robbery sequence, switching from micro to macro with Hitchcockian panache, and finally letting rip with a hell-for-leather climax.",
            "Humorless, charmless and flat.",
            "A production designed to entertain and to do it in such a way that the viewer remains glued to the seat with De Palma's visual and narrative inventiveness. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "There are some standout action sequences, and that's what really makes it worth a look back.",
            "If we're going by a comparison to James Bond, while I love me a good Bond film, Mission: Impossible is miles ahead of that entire franchise in its treatment of female characters.",
            "It's all very ambitious and very creative and very wonderful to watch...the first Mission: Impossible remains the closest to perfect that any Mission: Impossible movie has ever been.",
            "De Palma's film has some stunning sequences... But the movie so betrayed the spirit of the original TV series, by betraying the spirit and integrity of a formerly unimpeachable character, that the entire project smelled of cynicism.",
            "The film tries to push against its genre, and the auteurist flourishes are unmistakable.",
            "Still holds up as a fun, unique entry in the action spy genre and launched Tom Cruise's second career arc as an action megastar.",
            "What used to be an IMF team effort turned into another star vehicle for Tom Cruise.",
            "Sensational, implausible, irresistible to teens.",
            "It's a mission De Palma shouldn't have chosen to accept.",
            "Nimble, expertly contrived summer entertainment that doesn't insult the intelligence.",
            "Mission: Impossible helps remind us why the 1990s was such a powerhouse decade for great movies.",
            "It's silly, but expertly rendered and ridiculously exhilarating, which is exactly what De Palma does best.",
            "...succeeds in offering up several exciting and suspenseful sequences, though one can't help but wish that the dialogue-based moments packed the same sort of punch.",
            "Each scene in and of itself plays very interestingly, even if they don't always logically lead one into the next scene.",
            "An incredibly boring and confusing espionage thriller...So inept on so many levels that it could easily be called The Bonfire of the Secret Agents.",
            "Unfortunately, two scenes and a screwed up script, plus a big plot disappointment, do not a recommendation make."

            "The Cable Guy is a gutsy move on Carrey's part, suggesting a willingness to grow just where commercial good sense would say to stand pat.",
            "It barely matters that The Cable Guy fails [to satirize TV], because it is crammed with other pleasures, not least Carrey, who lets us glimpse the human being behind the sociopath.",
            "Carrey's life-of-a-bad-party manner is a major hoot as he toys with Broderick over legal and illegal installations.",
            "Whether Carrey's fans will like it or not, the film is easily his best crafted piece of work to date.",
            "To watch Carrey leering with joy at the prospect of making respectable people guess dirty words, and Broderick trying to avoid the whole thing, is to enjoy their best comic synergy.",
            "[The Cable Guy] is so repellent as to be almost literally unwatchable. This comedy isn't dark, it's extinguished. It isn't entertainment, it's pathology. ",
            "The hook to this weirdly compelling film is its teasing nature as a comedy of terrors.",
            "Sure, in the title role [Carrey] plays another in-your-face, over-the-top, wild and crazy guy. But for once he is not a lovable goof. He is a rather unsavory psychotic. And the movie itself is not pure farce: it is satire, with a disturbing edge.",
            "While it makes a convincing case that too much television is ultimately brain-rotting, it does so with an unjustifiable smugness.",
            "This is a darker film for Carrey, but he's still Jim Carrey. His shenanigans keep even the blackest moments goofy.",
            "As a supposed summer blockbuster, this is a very eccentric film: The Cable Guy mocks its star as a pathetic jerk and comes close to telling its audience that we are, too.",
            "Those who like enjoy seeing performers open up their ids in the name of comedy might get a kick out of Carrey's spooky malevolence. Others, however, enter at their own risk.",
            "In the hands of a smart director like Stiller, Carrey pushes his acting career to a new level here. The question is whether the comic's less daring fans are willing to go there with him.",
            "Matthew Broderick is a perfect straight man for Carrey, bringing his quiet intelligence to what's basically a one-dimensional character.",
            "More than anything, The Cable Guy is simply uncomfortable. It's Ace Ventura as the evil bad guy.",
            "For those with an appetite for Carrey and an admiration for Stiller, their zany collaboration will prove both funny and provocative.",
            "Director Ben Stiller effectively lines up his targets and Carrey effortlessly hits them, and, though this suffers at times from dull patches, it's much better than you may have heard.",
            "That said, Carrey's wild-eyed performance as a lonely and disturbed cable TV installer occasionally verges on brilliance. But it's not acting, it's just inspired mugging.",
            "While not the truly incisive film it could have been, this cautionary tale proves that there's more to Carrey than stupidity with an inflated price tag.",
            "This insipid comedy has all the zip of a trip down a playground slide lined with tar and broken glass.",
            "In this uneasy and uneasy-making hybrid of comedy and psychological horror, Carrey is all aggression.",
            "The film's heavy-handed message about the negative effect television has had on the national psyche doesn't help matters.",
            "...a sporadically engaging yet often misguided thriller that passes the time well enough, admittedly, but accomplishes little else. ",
            "The director, Ben Stiller, works with craftsmanly precision, but too much control can dampen madness."

            "It's a destructo orgy without any phony-baloney sanctimony about the fellowship of man -- or spaceman.",
            "The science-fiction comedy Mars Attacks! is a contrived B-movie pastiche with some spicy ingredients alien to other Tim Burton films: attitude, cynicism, misanthropy.",
            "The cast is so large that most of the actors don't stick around very long, but each has his or her moment to shine.",
            "Both a tribute to schlock sci-fi and a deconstruction of it, this sleekly cheeseball $70 million production is all attitude. It's not Burton's best by a long shot, but I came out smiling.",
            "Director Tim Burton fashions a hilariously twisted form of the alien invasion movie by skewering every silly sci-fi flick that ever had a budget smaller than its brain.",
            "Mars Attacks! plays its loony action for intentional laughs.",
            "Mars is a fireball of failure, a B-movie crammed full of A-list actors, an exercise in tacky self-indulgence that will numb you with its labored eccentricities. What's more, it would take a greater detective than I to find a single funny line.",

            "Zestfully tacky and broadly comic -- but never quite as funny as it promises to be -- Mars Attacks!' is fanboy-filmmaker Tim Burton's artfully crafted sendup of '50s sci-fi paranoia",
            "The best thing about Mars Attacks! is that you'll come away believing you could have done the movie better.",
            "Attacks' only real virtue is its consistency: On every level, whether it's acting, humor, action or special effects, it is consistently disappointing.",
            "Among an amazing roster of stars, Pierce Brosnan is hilarious as a presidential adviser and Lisa Marie is weirdly creepy as a disguised alien temptress.",
            "Of course, nobody expects a movie called Mars Attacks! to be fraught with deeper meanings. Still, it's disappointingly frivolous.",
            "A giddy mixture of the gross and the trashily poetic, it's hopelessly undisciplined, and will plunder giggles wherever it can find them; at its best, it can make you yelp with laughter.",
            "...a sadistically silly spoof that uses a cheesy ray gun to blow away the tropes of science-fiction past.",
            "Yes, it's over-the-top, but there's a terrifying truth in how politicians would want to spin this or media would want to angle it.",
            "An over directed and poorly written farce...",
            "While this is by no means among Burton's best work, looking overedited and messy with too many characters for its flimsy script, it nevertheless has the potential for an entertaining night out.",
            "Mars Attacks! may be the first sci-fi disaster movie that's also an impish black-comedy prank.",
            "Tim Burton's tribute to the B sci-fi-alien genre of the 1950s is sharply uneven, but the top-notch cast, dark humor, and production values offer some pleasure. ",

            "The Coen Brothers are among the most able practitioners in America and this film is one of their best attempts to turn a familiar genre -- the True Crime drama -- into something miles away from the ordinary.",
            "[Frances] McDormand is excellent and has a lot of fun with her tenacious and competent character, who is dedicated to duty and her sweet, supportive husband.",
            "In effect, the Coens have written an action film that disregards the basic principle of the genre: that character is expressed in action.",
            "Not only did the Coens return from the brink, but they gave us one of the most memorable (if not the most memorable) characters in modern cinema.",
            "Two words. Marge Gunderson.",
            "The film is a work of brick-by-brick world-building in the service of characters whose ordinariness is just as carefully crafted.",
            "A riveting drama of death, dismemberment, small town criminality, and exaggerated accents.",
            "Fargo, as wonderful as it was, is a film I will never again need to revisit.",
            "A classic story of unique quirkiness, where the characters themselves are just as memorable as the events that unfold.",
            "One of the richest American films of the 1990s.",
            "This curiously overpraised yet solid effort by two of the foremost satirists of contemporary Americana again finds director Joel and writer-producer Ethan surveying the wreckage of our national innocence.",
            "Fargo is the best movie ever made in Minnesota. Also the meanest.",
            "Deceptive in its storytelling choices, economical with its plotting, and sly with its dialogue, this Oscar winner is truly incredible.",
            "Fargo, with its grotesque murders and cheery detectives, is a cold gem that takes us to the far north. Its seemingly pitiless light opens up the realms of darkness concealed beneath that world of white.",
            "A small, supremely satisfying film. Heck and you betcha, it is.",
            "A few scenes go around in circles, as if snow-blind, and the humor may be too inward and contorted for some tastes. But McDormand brings order to the weirdness and warms it up.",
            "It's another daring black comedy by one of the most consistently inventive moviemaking teams of the last decade, brothers Joel and Ethan Coen.",
            "Returning to the horror-comic vein that launched their careers, director Joel Coen and producer Ethan Coen pepper their new picture with so much humor that the occasional bursts of sheer mayhem seem more ridiculous than revolting.",
            "You have to grant the Coens their due as creators of suspense, mood and plotting, and for their ability to color the most monstrous crimes with an undeniably funny sense of the absurd.",
            "From the camera angles to the set design, everything is calculated to make the viewer feel superior to the cloddish, geeky characters on display.",
            "McDormand is brilliant, Macy terrific, Presnell perfect, Buscemi fabulous. And Stormare is fascinating as one of the deadliest and most horrid big-screen killers in recent memory. Fargo is a down-and-dirty doozy.",
            "The result is a modern masterpiece.",
            "Fargo stands out as the Coen brothers' warmest, most accessible offering to date -- despite its frosty Minnesota setting.",
            "In the fascinating Fargo, writer-director Joel and writer-producer Ethan have come up with a film that is either an oddly funny crime drama or an ultra-deadpan comedy, depending on how you look at it."

            "Sweet nothing, then, but what would you expect of a rock movie devoted to the drummer?",
            "Mr. Hanks's debut feature, written and directed with delightful good cheer, is rock-and-roll nostalgia presented as pure fizz.",

            "A movie as catchy and likable as the title song.",

            "An undeniably delightful film. It makes you smile and want to dance, and (for better or worse) it's titular theme song won't leave your head for days.",
            "A simple, rather sweet and uncomplicated, rock and roll fable.",
            "With its exuberant tempo and danceable Beatlesque theme song, That Thing You Do will win the hearts of a broad audience.",
            "Uma hist\u00f3ria simples, contada de maneira tamb\u00e9m simples, que acaba agradando por suas boas inten\u00e7\u00f5es.",
            "Hanks sacrificed character complexity, but at least some period details are right.",
            "An amusing directorial debut by Hanks",
            "Short on substance but long on charm, That Thing You Do! is a lively, entertaining fable about a makeshift rock 'n' roll band that enjoys a brief moment of fame in the summer of 1964.",
            "Tom Hanks' writing-directing debut is a sweet valentine to rock 'n' roll."

            "Sporadically funny, but never more than a sting of crude gags.",
            "As funny as Nielsen can be, like all comic actors he still needs the quick-thinking jokes and zingy one-liners to be genuinely funny.",
            "Spy Hard just comes off as a long commercial. And yes, that means most of the best moments you've seen in the movie's trailer.",
            "More of a cinematic joke book than a real movie, Spy Hard hits you with gags faster than Henny Youngman on speed. Even when individual bits misfire, the unrelenting barrage of silliness can break down your resistance.",
            "Spy Hard is a loose send-up of the Bond series and other overly expensive action flicks, but after Hot Shots! Part Deux and National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1 who needs another action parody?",
            "[A] haphazardly executed send-up.",
            "The result is 80 brief minutes of movie skits assembled in an order that sort of resembles a plot.",
            "The movie will be of interest only to Nielsen's most devoted fans and to those who wonder why Nicollette Sheridan never made more movies, or more swimsuit calendars.",
            "The blockbuster action thriller genre is ripe for sending up, but this lazy effort has to go down as a miss despite the presence of spoofmeister Leslie Nielsen.",
            "Yet another Leslie Nielson movie parody, targeted this time at James Bond pictures and their many spinoffs.",
            "Nielsen's schtick is getting pretty threadbare by now -- his movies used to wring laughs from assaults on his silver-haired dignity, but after years of screen buffoonery, he has no dignity left to assault.",
            "Never mind that the smutty, high-tech 007 capers already wink at the conventions of the bikini-clad, gizmo-strewn genre. If the martini is shaken, not stirred, why beat it to death with a swizzle stick?",
            "The picture that will test the durability of Leslie Nielsen's lowbrow franchise, Spy Hard sticks closely to the Naked Gun formula. Not only is the formula itself wearing thin, but the gags themselves feel recycled.",
            "Like Hot Shots! there's the same mistaken belief that simply tagging other films will be intrinsically funny...",
            "This one's a real disappointment -- it only registered a few snickers from me at best.",
            "A classic example of why David Zucker/Jim Abrahams/Jerry Zucker-style comedies should be left to ZAZ themselves."

            "The best teen flick since Clueless is The Craft.",
            "The great strength of The Craft is that it doesn't pass judgment on why the girls are doing what they do... The film's message of female empowerment felt cathartic, but so did its rage.",
            "I've never subscribed to this genre of movie...I found a lot of this stuff to just not be palatable. But for its time, it's an okay movie.",
            "The effects are obviously a bit rough around the edges, and the acting is very mixed.",
            "Despite the fact that none of the actresses were anywhere near teen age while making the film, they're all pretty convincing as tortured teens expressing their pubescent angst through magic.",
            "I really like Fairuza Balk as an actress and I really enjoyed her here.",
            "The early going is interesting, amusing and even clever, but such cinematic niceties give way to a disappointing second hour.",
            "We watched Rochelle take her own power and take her own revenge. It is one of the many reasons why The Craft was ahead of its time.",
            "At an over-long 100 minutes, it's not likely to cast a spell over anyone.",
            "[It] will perhaps inspire a few rebel kids to search out a black-magic emporium or to make the sort of fashion statements that make Balk so amusingly spooky. All others should balk at taking in this suspenseless, hollow, kitchily crafted Carrie.",
            "It's rare enough in these days of studio megahype to be pleasantly surprised by a relatively unheralded movie, but such is the case with the second film from the director Andrew Davies",
            "The Craft casts a relatively potent spell.",
            "The glossy style and neat visual effects combine with a few genuinely creepy moments to make this above-average genre fare, though the full-on sorcery showdown belongs in another movie.",

            "There are some funny lines in there. And certainly, you can see a frustrated generation responding to it quite avidly.",

            "Campy teen witch thriller more violent than fun.",

            "A film you may not embrace, but I guarantee you will not forget.",
            "Stretched over 141 minutes, and threaded with humor, it is remarkably spare and simple, a slow movie about a slow man-Forrest Gump Unplugged.",
            "Much of the audience appeal relies on the film's simplicity",
            "Marking Billy Bob Thornton's debut as a director and solo writer, Sling Blade is a powerful southern gothic parable about good and evil.",
            "Well acted, a multi-leveled story and a pure honesty make Sling Blade one of my favourite films of the 1990s.",
            "Thornton brings three key ingredients to the table: distinctive, rich, authentic Southern locations, patient and painterly atmosphere, and a precise and fresh character to study. [Blu-ray]",
            "Thornton offers a subtle, thoughtful script, generally sensitive direction, and an understated performance, uh-huh.",

            "Okay, so it's Midnight Run meets All The President's Men, but the Lemmon-Garner rapport is dynamite and the glittering support cast of Lauren Bacall, Dan Aykroyd and John Heard are given sparkling dialogue.",
            "My Fellow Americans certainly holds up after several presidential administrations but the film could definitely be better.",
            "The humor is clearly of the lowbrow variety, but Lemmon and Garner handle their lines with the conviction of Royal Shakespeare Company members tackling Macbeth.",

            "If only movies could be impeached.",
            "Mostly, My Fellow Americans is solidly written, offbeat entertainment well-served by the fine leads, clever casting of supporting roles and a script that holds together, even through a less-than-stellar finale.",
            "The surprise of this comedy... is how sharply written it is -- almost sharply enough to overcome the crude direction that grotesquely overemphasizes the picture's inevitable sentimental interludes.",
            "The movie suggests we get the government we deserve, but do we really deserve this movie?",
            "It takes a special actor's grace to survive a script as lame as My Fellow Americans, and James Garner has it. Without appearing to break a sweat, Garner makes each grotesquely desperate attempt at humor look smooth and assured.",
            "An appalling piece of junk.",
            "Peter Segal's comedy has a few witty moments surrounded by a lot of silliness.",
            "Garner and Jack Lemmon have enough charisma, and there are enough solid laughs, to mostly overcome My Fellow Americans' embarrassing moments and improbable ending.",

            "On the jock front, Gooding is so believable in his role as Jerry's selfish, pea-brained, wide receiver client that the Dallas Cowboys might consider signing him to complement Michael Irvin.",
            "Cruise brilliantly portrays a man on the brink of losing his marbles and his grip on reality as he knows it: he's hilarious, sad and desperate but still seems charming in this 1996 movie.",
            "Zellweger's rumpled, anti-star quality plays in perfect contrast to Preston's buff and polish. She redeems Jerry Maguire and Tom Cruise, too by making him human again.",
            "I like Crowe's movies; I mostly enjoyed this one.",
            "Cruise is very good in small moments with Dorothy's son, played charmingly by Jonathan Lipnicki, but in some of the bigger scenes his performance is so wrong-headed you can't imagine what he was thinking.",
            "Cruise gives perhaps his most appealing performance ever in what is arguably his best movie.",
            "The dialogue is superb, bringing these relatable characters and their grounded situations an extraordinary sense of authenticity and hilarity.",
            "Jerry Maguire offers the best of both worlds: romance and sports.",
            "It's an easy charmer that manages to avoid the paint-by-numbers traps most romantic comedies fall into. Cruise should make more movies like this and Cameron Crowe should make more movies, period.",
            "This comedy has everything going for it, not least of which is Cruise's most appealing performance since Risky Business.",
            "Cruise's relationship with Zellweger's character is fascinating, far deeper and more honest than the usual cookie-cutter romance.",
            "It's Cameron Crowe's finest hour.",
            "The halting romance between Maguire and Dorothy -- he fearing intimacy, she admiring his budding humanity -- is one of the film's surpassing pleasures. The excellent supporting cast is another.",
            "Unlike Mission Impossible, Jerry Maguire gives Cruise something to work with... He takes to it with zest.",
            "It's hard to believe that this frantic, self-congratulatory affair was written and directed by Mr. Crowe, the man who did Say Anything and Singles, two films notable for their modesty and tact.",
            "We've been down this path of self-discovery with Cruise before, but Crowe's movie is a lot less predictable than you'd expect.",
            "[It] may be referred to as \"the Tom Cruise sports agent movie,\" but really is an exciting romance and cautionary yuppie tale. And the actor who steals the movie is a name you have never heard of -- Renee Zellweger.",
            "Some amusing stuff about sports agentry drowns in the emotional shallows of Jerry Maguire.",
            "Brashly engaging.",
            "Cameron Crowe's romantic comedy is well acted by Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. (in an Oscar-winning turn), but as a tale of redemption, the movie is not too deep and goes out of its way to satisfy viewers' expectations of a happy ending.",
            "The megabucks actor may have made M:I because it was expected of him, but his mission here was to learn something about himself-through acting, no less-and along the way he picked up something we've never seen in him before: passion.",
            "competently made parallel plotted film whose buddy sports film elements outshine its rom-com aspects.",
            "Tom Cruise is in top form playing Jerry Maguire, a slick sports agent with a heart.",
            "Smartly written and boasting a sensational cast, Cameron Crowe's shrewdly observed third feature also gives Tom Cruise one of his very best roles..."

            "Bad fantasy comedy is dated and materialistic; bullying. ",
            "The movie looked lively and imaginative in the trailer that has been showing for months. Stretch it out to 92 minutes, though, and you realize that the entire thing was effectively and attractively squeezed into the preview.",
            "Ultimately this is a kids-only affair.",

            "Horrible kids movie. The kid is annoying and there's no clever humor.",

            "The visual trickery might delight children, but Kazaam will leave even them wishing for more of the genie's playful trickery to make up for lackluster comedy in the story.",
            "The movie's producers could use a genie of their own. Surely, if granted three wishes, they could have produced a better film."

            "Fan is a fascinating but flawed study of celebrity and the reverential relationship we have with our stars. The film is a hall of mirrors with Shah Rukh playing a thinly disguised version of himself as Aryan Khanna the superstar. ",
            "A little more restraint in maintaining the tonal consistency would have resulted in a much darker and satisfying cautionary tale about the perils of fame and blind love.",
            "[Director Sharma] pads out the songless film with well-executed but overlong action pieces that become even more frustrating when you consider the ways time could have been better spent exploring Aryan's fascinating backstory.",
            "SRK couldn't have found a better vehicle than Fan, both as an actor and as a celebration of the highs and the lows of his own stardom.",
            "Only trouble, after this terrific three-hander -- all deft elision, switcheroos and nods -- Shah Rukh Khan can never go back to lazily sending himself up again.",
            "I can guarantee that the next time you see a horde of screaming fans, you'll observe them more keenly. You might even wonder what their stories are.",
            "What a pleasure to watch Shah Rukh Khan shrug off every quirk his admirers have drooled over for 27 years and sink his teeth into a role.",
            "The makers just can't resist the urge of \"playing the game\" (and then mentioning it, literally) - oversmart disguises, over-shoulder strides, anonymous phone calls, ignorant foreigners...",
            "This is a mediocre film saved by the presence of its overpowered, overexposed, and overconfident star.",
            "[The] story could have benefitted from being a bit more restrained.",
            "An insightful rumination on the codependency between idols and their devotees, disguised as a psychological thriller.",
            "This is Shah Rukh's official entry into the modern evolutionary phase of Indian cinema, an attempt to break away from his mainstream romantic hero image.",
            "Sharma and Faisal borrow ideas from the Hollywood movie Fan and Khan's back catalogue to fashion an absorbing thriller about a twisted lookalike that perhaps unintentionally doubles up as a reflection on the actor's career graph.",
            "With Fan, SRK proves why he is considered one of the finest actors in business.",
            "Just for these rare moments inspired by Shah Rukh Khan's real life, you should go and watch Fan.",
            "Straight away, no-one does freaky with more flair than Shah Rukh Khan.",
            "It's engaging to watch a powerful actor and his seemingly powerless admirer indulge in a twisted battle of wills.",
            "Fan ends up as a disappointment for its unwillingness to explore the complicated, at times unfathomable relationship between an actor and his fans, and for reducing it to an average thriller.",
            "Fan is Shah Rukh Khan's best effort since Chak De! India.",
            " It's a total throwback to Shah Rukh Khan's '90s avatars, but he once again shows how good he still is in that genre.",
            "Fan works for the most part because it has the fabulous SRK act as a 'young' star-struck boy. His energetic performance is worth the price of the ticket -- if not more.",
            "Superb special makeup effects work by Greg Cannom enables Bollywood legend Shah Rukh Khan to play both a screen superstar and his youthful lookalike fan in this enjoyably twisty thriller.",
            "Despite the slapdash plotting, the film - taken from the point of view of the star - gives an uneasy insight into the celebrity's co-dependent relationship with the people who make him, and can destroy him.",
            "Outrageous and enjoyably absurd."
