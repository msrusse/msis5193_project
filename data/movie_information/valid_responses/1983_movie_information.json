            "It's everything it ought to be -- glorious, exhilarating, exciting, absorbing, technically wondrous. But there also is something bittersweet in the knowledge that, with Jedi, we are bidding a fond farewell to all of the characters we got to know so well.",
            "The characters and dialogue get lost somewhere between the bug-eyed monsters and the exploding spaceships, but it is all so much fun it probably really does not matter a whole lot.",
            "With this last of the central Star Wars cycle, there is the sense of the closing of a circle, of leaving behind real friends. It is accomplished with a weight and a new maturity that seem entirely fitting, yet the movie has lost none of its sense of fun.",
            "An enthralling resolution that brings the epic story of Darth Vader to a close.",
            "A premonition of what future Star Wars films would be like, good and bad, and why.",
            "While Star Wars: Episode 6 - Return of the Jedi isn't as great as its immediate predecessors, the film ends the trilogy on a bang.",
            "Exciting, intense and, once finished, leaves us wanting much more. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Return of the Jedi is a very satisfying end to the original trilogy.",
            "Definitely more good than bad, the opening and the big Luke-Vader-Emperor showdown are great, it just has some weaker elements that drag the overall experience down.",
            "Return of the Jedi is a fitting, if not quite spectacular, end to a classic trilogy",
            "It's not a total disappointment, but compared to its two predecessors, it's definitely a minor film. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "It's largely captivating at gigantic SFX and VFX spectacle; it's good at family movie and it's trivial at adult movie.",
            "'Jedi' takes a little longer to get going, but once it does, the Star Wars finale ends on a satisfying and rewarding note for fans who watch it for the first of 50th time.",
            "...a capper to a solid trilogy that's nevertheless not quite the flawless work its reputation would seem to indicate.",
            "The film has special effects so incredible that it will become the standard by which future efforts are measured, and it leaves the audience cheering and happy.",
            "Lucas has once again recycled the B movies of his youth: jungle movies, gangster movies, pirate movies, you name it. He culls bits from them that still have oomph and mounts them with a Sesame-Street zap.",
            "Highly entertaining.",
            "Though the 1983 film's effects seem almost quaint by today's awesome standards, Jedi has something the newer movies don't: characters we care about, not to mention a plot that involves both them and us.",
            "Unfortunately, it conveys the sense that the machinery has already started to wear down, and the inventiveness to wear thin.",

            "...when Luke and Darth Vader face off before the drooling Emperor, the franchise comes to its rightful fruition."

            "Never Say Never Again is the best acted Bond picture ever made, because it clearly surpasses any predecessors in the area of inventive and clever character delineation.",
            "In Never Say Never Again, the formula is broadened to accommodate an older, seasoned man of much greater stature, and Mr. Connery expertly fills the bill. ",
            "[Connery] does at least handle the whole charade, a retread of Thunderball, with a pleasing sense of irony as he reacquaints himself with old adversary Blofeld (Von Sydow) and thwarts SPECTRE's plans.",
            "Without absolute conviction, no action film can survive: if there's no belief, there's no danger.",
            "It is good to see Connery's grave stylishness in this role again. It makes Bond's cynicism and opportunism seem the product of genuine worldliness (and world weariness) as opposed to Roger Moore's mere twirpishness.",
            "After a 12-year hiatus, Sean Connery is back in action as James Bond. The new entry marks something of a retreat from the far-fetched technology of many of the later Bonds in favor of intrigue and romance.",
            "It may be Bond, but without the use of the gun barrel graphics, the booming theme music, and the opening title silhouettes of nude figures, it just doesn't feel the same.",
            "Adding together a marvellous array of sophistication, comedy and action. Never Say Never Again is superb entertainment.",
            "Overall I liked Never Say Never Again but it fell far short of the movie it could have been. The makers should have been more adventurous instead of simply trying to beat Broccoli at his own game.",
            "Everything is more implausible and entertaining, even though the structure is the same. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Superior to 'Octopussy', it shows that Connery is, for the moment, the actor who best treated the character, the only one who even took it seriously, possessed the necessary humor to make us laugh at him. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "Essentially, it's a remake of the less successful Thunderball, also with Connery. but Never Say Never Again, in the original Bond spirit, concentrates on the people rather than the gadgets -- at least for the first half.",
            "If you haven't seen 'Thunderball,' this is a lot more enjoyable, but matched up against one of the more exciting 007 films, 'Never Say Never' fails to do it better.",
            "It's not a rap against Roger Moore to say that this film seems to bring James Bond back to life. Sean Connery did, after all, define the character.",
            "Sean Connery is still up to par as James Bond in the latest adventure of Agent 007.",
            "The plot, which owes much to Thunderball, lurches badly at times, but the wild action set pieces, decked out in gals, gadgets and glib lines, are there to be cherished.",
            "A fitting farewell to 007's most enduring embodiment: as much a playful send-up as a loving final embrace.",
            "Can we just consider 1983 a lost year for James Bond? First, \"Octopussy,\" then Sean Connery's return in a depressing dilution of the 007 brand - one that ends with a fourth wall-breaking wink indicative less of arch fun, more of bored indifference.",
            "I know Bond fans were furious about this movie cause it wasn't an Eon production, and I think they're wrong. They should be furious at it because it's a horrendous film. ",
            "The slick production values impress and Barbara Carrera and Klaus Maria Brandauer are good value villains, but Irvin Kershner appears to have nodded off in the director's chair.",
            "An ugly, unwanted epilogue [to Connery's Bond], in which the character who was so iconic and perfect is reduced to a self-conscious joke.",
            "There is a special place in movie hell for Never Say Never Again. Not that it's particularly bad -- though it's hardly good -- but because it's such a cheeseball experience with a strange and horrible pedigree.",
            "Connery proved plenty fit for one more outing...a likeable but somewhat mediocre adventure handsomely mounted in the traditional Bond style...[Blu-ray]",
            "It's an aging and unenthusiastic Connery who returns to play Bond, who doesn't have the physicality to do justice any more to the demanding muscular role."

            "The facts it can lay its hands on do not support a politically alarming or dramatically compelling conclusion to the mysteries of this case. Nor do they lead to a very uplifting statement about the motives and character of its central figure.",
            "A very fine biographical drama.",
            "Silkwood's \"ordinariness\" protects her from being labelled a wild-eyed Trot, but that should not be allowed to obscure her courage or the whitewash ladled onto her story after her death.",
            "Silkwood is the story of an ordinary woman, hard-working and passionate, funny and screwed-up, who made those people mad simply because she told the truth as she saw it and did what she thought was right.",
            "For most of its running time it is so convincing -- and so sure of itself -- that it seems a particular waste when it goes dangerously wrong.",
            "It has nothing new to tell us. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Despite the recent headlines, there will be many people whose only source of Silkwood's story will be this film. They should receive more than the drama of one rash woman's death, no matter how artistically presented.",
            " A top notch cast, and a strong, Oscar nominated script by Nora Ephron and Alice Arlen, keep Silkwood  from sliding into cliche 'Lifetime movie of the week' territory.",
            "It's a thought-provoking film that asks questions about the safety of the nuclear power industry that are still pertinent.",
            "The film seems... unconvincing when it tries to argue the case of Silkwood's martyrdom, but it soars magnificently when it confines itself to the drama of one woman's courage in renouncing complacency for action.",
            "Seemingly better suited for a documentary.",
            "Gripping.",
            "One of Nichols' best films, Silkwood is effective as factual reportage and portrait of working class life (rare sight in Hollywood cinema), with terrific performances by Meryl Streep, as a new type of American heroine, and Cher, as her lesbian roommate",
            "Silkwood achieves impressive credentials as a drama of human character, not just as a screed against intolerable public practice.",
            "Extremely well-acted, powerful story.",
            "Meryl Streep gives the year's most astounding performance by an actress, adding vigor and complexity to almost every scene with her endlessly inventive portrayal of the eccentric heroine. The supporting players skillfully follow her lead.",
            "Nichols does a superb job of establishing the mood and atmosphere of this small town...",
            "Based on the real-life story of Karen Silkwood, this blistering expos\u00e9 of big business from director Mike Nichols features a brilliant performance by Meryl Streep.",
            "A tragic story, to be sure, but one that deserves better than the shabby treatment afforded it here. Streep is particularly grating."

            "It takes all of perhaps five minutes to fall in love with the leading characters in Terms of Endearment and from that point on, the audience is just putty in the extremely capable hands of writer-director James L. Brooks.",
            "Terms of Endearment is about three relationships and students of screenwriting would do well to study the way in which these three stories are told completely and effortlessly in a movie of average length.",
            "Its quirky rhythms and veering emotional tones are very much its own, and they owe less to movie tradition than they do to a sense of how the law of unintended consequences pushes us ceaselessly through the years, permitting no pause for perspective.",
            "With this attention to maintaining a certain earnestness, overflowing with small details and comic touches, the pacing lags - even when laughs or heartbreak are abundant.",

            "Dysfunctional adults, an unhappy marriage, too many kids, a cruel mom, an over-the-hill astronaut, and cancer are elements in this hardcore tear-jerker. Cry, cry, cry.",

            "As tragedy moves in on Terms of Endearment during the last half hour, theatres will be awash with tears. That tragedy is a contrivance and terribly manipulative. But the characters have become too achingly familiar to warrant an easy dismissal.",
            "It's bad enough when a movie uses terminal cancer as a premise; it's even worse when it uses terminal cancer as a payoff.",

            "In The Outsiders, the director's class is consistently present, but it may be a case of the wrong man for the job, since overall film plays unevenly, with a cliche and detached ambiance that robs the plotline of what passion it might've whipped up.",
            "One of the most overtly aesthetic, art-for-art's-sake films in Hollywood's history, a faux-na\u00eff Pre-Raphaelite mural in which angels with dirty faces but immaculately pure hearts burn with a hard, gemlike flame before being snuffed out in their prime.",
            "Because it falls in with the undulating rhythm of the life of its heroes, for whom a fatal fight and a quiet night have almost equal importance, the picture never manages to reach the peaks of satisfying Hollywood melodrama.",
            "Well acted and crafted but highly conventional.",
            "The film is unremitting in its morbid sentimentality, running its teenage characters through a masochistic gamut of beatings, killings, burnings, and suicides.",
            "Lightly likeable.",
            "Because of his sentimentality, Coppola misses the opportunity to reflect more vigorously on the life of these teenagers. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Watching it again recently I found all of Coppola's cornball flourishes to be rather endearing, even generous. ",
            "A satisfying example of the artist-as-talented-hack.",
            "Ultimately, \"The Outsiders\" feels like two movies awkwardly thrown together - one a tough-acting antiseptic to the sanitized-suburbia Spielberg fantasies that ruled the era's box office, the other a besotted valentine to widescreen epics of old.",
            "Francis Ford Coppola's cheesy, overblown adaptation of S.E. Hinton's wonderful novel captures none of the book's gritty magic.",
            "Coppola's take on S.E. Hinton's classic. Teens+.",
            "As a movie, it's mediocre. As a clue to Coppola's thinking, it shows he still has things to learn about the relation between technology and expression.",
            "A devouring CinemaScope fever dream: an homage to Robert Wise and Nicholas Ray that took its chief inspiration from the timeless backlit twilights of Gone with the Wind.",
            "Flawed though it might be, it's still an exciting piece of film made by an innovative director who was firing on all cylinders.",
            "The new cut of \"The Outsiders\" aptly entitled \"The Complete Novel\" expands what existed before to such a degree that the framework of the novel is restored...",
            "A deeply strange film that gives '60s hoodlums the personalities of Care Bears and places them under constant attack from preppies in pastel sweaters.",
            "[Coppola's] revisions to the film, which include a new, improved soundtrack, invest it with grandeur worthy of both its characters and his own ambitions.",
            "While his film lacks the emotional conviction and psychological insight of Nicholas Ray's classic work, his grandiose vision pays off in some stunning camerawork.",
            "Francis Coppola's revision of his 1983 film of S.E. Hinton's best seller The Outsiders is funny, touching and revelatory.",
            "The Outsiders was relatively cheap, and also brought Coppola back to a kind of human drama that his post-Godfather work had been lacking, the result enrapturing a good number of teens and pre-teens in the 1980s."

            "Philip Kaufman's 1983 film is an efficient and absorbing recapitulation of the main events of Tom Wolfe's book that still never succeeds in capturing the inner drives and ethics of the test pilots and astronauts - the \"right stuff\" never materializes.",
            "Rarely has a film made a historic accomplishment seem so vivid and personal... It makes you wonder, quite suddenly, why there aren't more movies like this.",
            "The Right Stuff is a spectacular celebration of those heroes of the skies -- those fly jocks who fought the demons of space to launch a new era in American air technology.",
            "Kaufman has combined the resources and ingenuity of movie making with the freewheeling, damn-the-conventions style of of the New Journalism and come up with a generous, high-spirited look at the bravery and lunacy that was that era.",
            "It means something to be a member of the brotherhood whose trials and accomplishments are celebrated so enjoyably in The Right Stuff.",
            "The Right Stuff is so clumsily shot and has such a simple structure that boredom can threaten to drown the viewer's patience. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "An epic symphony of triumph that portrays modern man as the ultimate being driven by power. So visually stunning it looks almost experimental. [Full review in Spanish].",
            "Masculinely romantic...",
            "The Right Stuff (1983), Philip Kaufman's adaptation of Tom Wolfe's acclaimed portrait of the original NASA astronauts, is *the* American epic of the last great frontier and a genuinely romantic take on the first generation of space cowboys.",
            "A great movie that unfortunately failed to attract audiences back in '83, this adaptation of Tom Wolfe's book about astronauts pays tribute to what we would like to believe represents the American spirit: hard work, perseverance, camaraderie and vision.",
            "History, melodrama, comedy and satire are skilfully combined in this consistently exciting adventure. Visually and dramatically it rarely sags, there's a vivid array of characters and though it's a film with issues, these never eclipse the human drama.",
            "Moviegoers seeking a grand yet edifying entertainment, right-stuffed with what Kaufman calls \"seriousness of subject matter and a wild humor that comes out of left field,\" now know where to look...",
            "One of the scattered handful of truly great American movies in the first half of the 1980s.",
            "Educational, exciting action, great acting.",
            "The Right Stuff is a humdinger. Full of beauty, intelligence and excitement, this big-scale look at the development of the US space program and its pioneering aviators provides a fresh, entertaining look back at the recent past.",
            "Though critically acclaimed, Philip Kaufman's superbly realized adventure about the early Space Age was a commercial flop, due to its satirical tone and unfortunately close association with the presidential candidacy of John Glenn.",
            "Historical drama as well as vastly entertaining adventure.",
            "Consistently compelling, capturing all the ambiguity and tension of the book.",
            "From the opening moments it is clear that we have the nearest modern equivalent to a Western: men of quiet virtue going skyward, leaving the tawdry world of log-rolling politicians behind.",
            "Along with Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America it's the last great American epic -- the kind of film that couldn't be made today.",
            "Kaufman's enormously entertaining history of America's Mercury astronauts fizzled on release, maybe because it was too smart and cool for its own good."

            "Like a man drawn to the edge of a cliff by the lure of the abyss below, we're secretly obsessed by the apocalypse. Moralists may claim that WarGames is more exploitation than warning, but it's still an exciting, giddily entertaining movie.",
            "The chase sequences with government agents are tame but the film builds to a tense (and witty) conclusion at the Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker in Colorado Springs.",
            "Classic humanist-didactic filmmaking, effectively presented as a thriller.",
            "To me, the most enjoyable aspect of WarGames is when David is at work on his computer system. There's something wonderfully nostalgic about watching a guy play with such antiquated machinery and recognize that it was [once] considered state-of-the-art.",
            "John Badham solders the pieces into a terrifically exciting story charged by an irresistible idea: an extra-smart kid can get the world into a whole lot of trouble that it also takes the same extra-smart kid to rescue it from.",
            "As tense and effective now as it was 25 years ago. The worry back then was more about Soviet missiles than about credit card identity theft, but good filmmaking techniques haven't changed.",
            "WarGames kicks off with an exciting sequence...",
            "The movie is a spectacle as well as a presumably pacifist proclamation. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "What keeps it remarkably fresh is an unpatronising approach to what is ostensibly a kids' thriller, and a set of ideas (remember when Hollywood used them?) that rightly consign all the cradle modems and dot-matrix printers to the margins.",
            "Slick and suspenseful, though a little heavy-handed.",
            "This inventive nail-biter is very much a product of its time -- blending the arms-race unease of the early 1980s with the beginning of the home-computer revolution -- but it still manages to both grip and entertain.",
            "Time might not have been kind to the look of WarGames, but with nuclear war still a very real threat, the picture's ability to manufacture suspense remains undimmed.",
            "It's far too simplistic for comfort -- and downright dangerous if it makes anyone think today's self-destructive forces will bow jovially out of sight as soon as we grown-ups loosen up a little.",
            "Memory makes the heart grow fonder, even when you're blowing up the world. ",
            "As a Cold War message movie and cinematic descendent of Fail-Safe, WarGames examines the inherent danger in favoring technology's cool logic and situational calculations.",
            "In many ways, John Badham's intriguing tale was prophetic.",
            "Suspenseful Cold War tale with teen gamer in control. ",
            "Although today it feels rather dated, especially with its technology, it is one of the better examples of the genre.",
            "In this sage satire, warfare is boiled down to the inanities of tic-tac-toe",
            "What works best about it works still: it's a paranoid film with an ambiguous ending.",
            "One of the early films to warn about the dangers of hackers and the possibilities of computers controlling our lives.",
            "The film hasn't nearly the despair of Dr. Strangelove, but it retains the same underlining moral questions in its portrayal of these unimaginable dilemmas.",
            "The only drawback is that the film's anti-nuke message seems a bit heavy-handed at times. It is hard, though, to imagine any message being more entertainingly delivered.",
            "The first half has a sardonic edge to it, but the more seriously the movie takes itself the sillier it gets."

            "A sublime comic parable about the quest for identity.",
            "A masterpiece: a brilliant, even passionate historical pastiche, a superbly pregnant meditation on American society and individuality, and an eerie fantasy that will live in your dreams.",
            "Lampooning documentary tradition by structuring the entire film as a meticulously crafted bogus docu, Woody Allen tackles some serious stuff en route",
            "The comedy tends to the smirk-inducing rather than the laugh-out-loud, and the second half wanders somewhat, but Zelig is a strong contender for Allen's most fascinating film.",
            "Zelig is small but it's one of those Allen comedies by which all his other films will be compared.",

            "Performances are all extremely effective, with Pacino leading the way.",
            "Still a must-see for Pacino's potent and influential performance.",
            "Scarface has become a touchstone of pop culture, one of the half dozen or so most frequently referenced films of our era.",
            "It will primarily be remembered as a machine-gun-soaked actioner of tough talk, cinematic betrayals and retribution, and mountains of cocaine.",
            "Day-Glo Miami is framed well by John A. Alonzo, and the pulsating music by Giorgio Moroder is worthy of a listen on its own.",
            "Pacino is a brilliant actor and his portrayal of a Cuban immigrant in Scarface is a perfect example of his work.",
            "De Palma directs it as a blood-drenched thug opera, a mix of the graceful and the garish with Pacino's guttural thug-in-a-suit spitting out dialogue like broken glass in a harsh Cuban accent. ",
            "The sharp, if expletive-ridden, dialogue in Oliver Stone's script and the vivid cinematography of John A Alonzo help make De Palma's urban shocker a modern-day classic.",
            "Characterization and plot go out the window. Arms are cut off with chain saws. By the third hour everything is out of control.",
            "[Brian DePalma] apparently considers ''money isn't everything'' an original and profound message.",
            "One fundamentally dishonest character choice launched a billion-dollar industry. But it hardly sours a film that became a garishly ghoulish, bleakly funny and compulsively watchable template for modern-criminal deconstructions of the American Dream.",
            "By ignoring its massive, toxic, nuclear-fallout shortcomings, it finds its way to the hallowed status of camp classic.",
            "one of Brian DePalma's best films",
            "...much, much longer than it generally needs to be...",
            "One of the best gangster dramas ever made, driven by Pacino's haunting performance and De Palma's lightning pace.",
            "It's a whole new spin on the immigrant story and the American Dream as an underworld nightmare and a fitting bookend to the two Godfather films.",
            "the very definition of excess, which is perhaps why it has persisted so long as a cultural totem: Its florid pleasures can never be exhausted",
            "Paciono gives a riveting performance in the lead in De Palma's over-the-top but engaging modern version of the classic gangster",
            "Extremely violent '80s crime classic with drugs, sex, etc.",
            "Pacino's bravura performance dominates, making no concessions to our sensibilities. And the final shootout is a tour de force of editing.",
            "This almost Jacobean tale of drug gangsters in 1980s Miami is rather too long for the points it makes, but is nevertheless riveting and still, after 26 years, remarkably fresh."

            "Filled with Forsyth's understated witticisms, from the b-roll footage of side characters, enacting their own moments of comic whimsy... It's the same puckish quality that also fuels the film's careful sense of longing. ",
            "An absolutely disarming comedy.",
            "Forsyth both inverts expectations and runs with them in this story about the sea, the sky, and a dreamily weird village of straight-talking locals.",
            "Without question, the most charming British film of the 1980s.",
            "Bill Forsyth directs the film with wry understatement and has gentle affection for all of his characters. ",
            "It's the feel-good flick of the decade.",
            "Here is a small film to treasure, a loving, funny, understated portrait of a small Scottish town and its encounter with a giant oil company.",
            "A heartwarming and whimsical comedy of manners.",
            "Charming, whimsical, and practically perfect.",
            "It demonstrates Mr. Forsyth's uncanny ability for making an audience sense that something magical is going on, even if that something isn't easily explained.",
            "Absolutely wonderful."
