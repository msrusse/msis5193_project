            "Armageddon is big and noisy and stupid and shameless and it's going to be huge at the box office.",

            "It's strictly a side issue whether mankind will survive colliding with an asteroid the size of Texas; the real question is whether Liv Tyler, who plays Bruce Willis's daughter, gets to keep her boyfriend.",
            "The special effects are the best that $150 million can buy and the script plays like a near-afterthought.",
            "The end of the world is going to be very noisy and filled with some of the worst dialogue ever.",
            "...more macho and jingoistic action...",
            "[Michael Bay's] hyper jaunty technique of cut, cut, cut leaves the audiences gasping for air, and never lets a scene's impact truly sink in. ",

            "Virtually nothing happens, and it happens at the most unrelenting speed.",
            "The special effects are spectacular, even if the acting and script are patchy, but at two and half hours long, it overstays its welcome.",
            "By the time Bay and Bruckheimer appropriate John F. Kennedy's image in their final small-town-America montage, it's clear their pomposity knows no limits.",
            "Armageddon peels your eyelids back and blows your eardrums out until rational analysis is moot.",
            "Producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay are slick Hollywood operators who know exactly what they're doing: Armageddon's heart beats strongly, but it's pumping adrenaline rather than blood.",
            "Just when you think you've had it with this movie, there comes a farcical, rock 'n' roll sort of comedy sequence, or a hilariously goofy line.",
            "Most of the time, Armageddon simply makes your head hurt.",
            "If you're going to blow up the world -- or advertise your intentions to do so -- you might as well have some laughs along the way.",
            "Affleck demonstrates a sexy Paul Newmanish charm and is clearly bound for stardom.",
            "It's such a thrill ride, in fact, that after its 2 1/2 hours of thrills, you're likely to feel more pummeled than entertained, which is just the point.",
            "Bay directs Armageddon in a way that seems more concerned with constantly assaulting the senses than anything else, hoping perhaps that the quick cuts and constant explosions will distract from his film's many flaws.",
            "So predictable it could have been written by a chimp who's watched too much TV, the huge movie is as dumb as it is loud, and it's way too loud. Watching it is like putting your head in a tin washbucket while weightlifters whack it with golf clubs.",
            "Bay has simply botched the job. His action sequences, especially those on the asteroid, are impenetrable and chaotic. And the narrative, larded with the usual military double-cross, is preposterous.",
            "[Bay's] movies are trailers for themselves. Every scene is all climax and no foreplay. When it's all over you can't remember if you've been watching a movie or just a jumbo-sized coming attraction.",

            "Schwartzman is cautious but stubbornly optimistic, while Murray is possessed by the mania of near-despair... They make the best and most disconcerting odd couple that American movies have produced in a long while.",
            "Rushmore is an almost indefinable genre of its own. A comedy with a menacing edge? An ironic romance? Hard to call. Anderson, the director and co-writer, and Wilson, co-writer, have a vision like no one else's.",
            "A quirky, sometimes hilarious and often touching comic fable.",
            "There's an unshakable confidence about this coming-of-age fable that matches that of its central character, Max Fischer.",
            "Rushmore offers more than simply a series of high-grade yuks; it's a finely-judged parable on the line between self-delusion and reality.",
            "If happiness is finding something you love to do and doing it forever, one of my somethings might just be watching this oddly uproarious little flick.",
            "Anderson fulfills the promise of his inventive Bottle Rocket with this quirky, often hilarious comedy, and Murray gives his most uproarious performance since the groundbreaking Groundhog Day.",
            "Despite cute moments, nothing about Rushmore begs to be liked, which makes this modest comedy all the more satisfying.",
            "A gloriously inventive little comedy about the scholastic and romantic woes of a 15-year-old student at a private academy.",
            "Just when you expect the film to do something normal, it takes off like Murray -- riffing on reality as only he, and filmmaker Anderson, can.",
            "It's somehow fitting that in this Maxcentric universe, Rushmore exists as a satirical comedy, full of dry wit and adolescent absurdities, and a bittersweet valentine to manipulative misfits who actually find the love they deserve. ",
            "Bill Murray -- playing a depressed millionaire -- steals every scene in this quirky, edgy and very funny tale of an outsider who just might end up leading all those who laugh at him.",
            "There's a danger of overselling Anderson's sweet-hearted, loony little fantasy, but everything -- from the soundtrack of '60s Brit bands with their jangly anthems of angsty love to Robert Yeoman's slightly hyper-real photography -- fits perfectly.",
            "An inspired second feature from director Wes Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson, the picture shares the offbeat rhythms and disarming humor of their overlooked debut, Bottle Rocket.",
            "The hint of genuine pathos [Murray] brings to Rushmore tempers Schwartzman's brash, sometimes off-putting antics, gracing an already great comedy with surprising depth and heart.",
            "Rushmore is accurate enough on the teen-angst front to make you wince, yet whimsical enough to make you want Max to win.",
            "One of the freshest, richest, most original films to come out of Hollywood in a very long time.",
            "Bill Murray projects a seriocomic intensity here comparable to Charlie Chaplin's classic Little Tramp. ",
            "Rushmore may have shades of J.D. Salinger's writing and Hal Ashby's movies, but Wes Anderson pulls humor from the trickiest of situations and always manages to surprise.",
            "Probably of more interest to adults than to teens.",
            "Besides being a terrific film in its own right, seen today, Rushmore almost seems like a trailer for the films that have followed it.",
            "The director treats eccentricity with compassionate respect: no winking, no nudges to even like the boy. The filmmaking, meanwhile, is beautifully disciplined.",
            "An observation on what happens when the world of children and adults collide, perfectly embodied in Schwartzman's performance."

            "The orthodox blood-drinking vampires...are about as frightening as snitty runway models, and are only there to threaten Bella's maidenly Type O so Edward can rescue her for the seven-hundredth time.",

            "Yes, it's strongly geared to the teen audience, but don't hold it against the filmmakers and go in with any preconceived notions and you'll find it a fun opening chapter of a new franchise.",
            "It's not the stunts and derring-do which excite the senses as much as the quiet chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson; that is guaranteed to get your blood up."

            "[A] masterfully executed cautionary tale... Yet there's something missing here: While Weir delivers both sharp wit and gentle poignancy, Truman's end catharsis needs greater emotional heft.",
            "One of the smartest, most inventive movies in memory, it manages to be as endearing as it is provocative.",
            "The premise of Peter Weir's The Truman Show is both reasonable and ludicrous, its execution sublime.",
            "Most movies are lucky to have one idea rattling around inside. The unusually resonant Truman positively vibrates with themes.",
            "The Truman Show finds a near-miraculous balance of humor and feeling in the keen intelligence of the script by Andrew Niccol and the prodigal inventiveness of Dead Poets Society director Peter Weir at his very best.",
            "To be sure, the movie has plenty of laughs, but like sunlight on the deceptively calm surface of the sea, its light humor dances fitfully over dark and dangerous undercurrents.",
            "The ahead-of-its-time film spoke volumes about everything from politics to the rampant rise of reality TV.",
            "My favorite role of Jim Carrey's career",
            "Ahead of its time, The Truman Show remains one of the best scripts ever. Clever and sweet, Peter Weir's execution is near perfect. Oh, and Jim Carrey is fantastic. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "The Truman Show is one of the most startlingly original American movies in years, enough to give one faith in the salutary and inspiring nearness of the new millennium. ",
            "As Truman, Jim Carrey turns his usually frenetic acting style down to a subtle level many would have thought beyond him. ",
            "You can't take your eyes off Jim Carry. He's the most likable clown since Charlie Chaplin, and his sunny smile lightens the serious subject matter. He's the perfect subject to make Reality TV a reality. ",
            "One of the greatest American films of the 1990s.",
            "A disturbing, spooky but eventually uplifting drama/satire/horror film starring Jim Carrey.",
            "Peter Weir's film is so cleverly conceived and brilliantly executed that it almost seems like a fresh thought. And even if it doesn't, it nevertheless forms the basis of a very witty exercise.",
            "Director Peter Weir has created a strikingly subversive piece of information-age paranoia as visionary as anything Hollywood might manufacture this summer, or this decade.",
            "The Truman Show will probably be the most thought-provoking \"big\" movie to come out this summer, and that says a whole lot more about other movies than it does about this one. You should, however, see it for Carrey's newly unveiled charms.",
            "In the end, Weir's movie is more a capitulation than a challenge to television, and a vulgar one at that. Truman turns out to be more Burbank than he is True-man.",
            "As inventive and creative as Weir's staging is, The Truman Show wouldn't work without credible Truman. And Carrey carries off the tricky role with a chipperness that belies a deep-seeded longing for more in life than surface perfection.",
            "Under a cheerfully sunny sky that only heightens the paranoia, it's brilliant in conception and execution, with dozens of bright touches -- verbal jokes, visual jokes, spooky looks.",
            "Weir's touch is light and effortless, the film's pleasures falling as gently as the Mozart music piped from Seahaven's sky.",
            "By trying too hard to be profound about the evils of television, this implausible sci-fi morality tale stretches this theme beyond the breaking point.",
            "Excellently cast, immaculately designed and imaginatively filmed, The Truman Show casts the hypnotic blue glow of the television screen in a whole new light.",
            "Tthis ingenious satirical comedy drama about media omnipotence is both dazzling and sophisticated from audacious start to poignant finale."

            "It's certainly distinctive, looking at times like Richard Lester put through a postmodernist blender.",

            "Pic serves up a sensory overload without any compensatory reflection on the outlandish and irresponsible behavior on view.",
            "A film of brilliant moments, but sadly less coherent - and, on senses, rather less personal - than most of Gilliam's work.",
            "All you will learn is that the irksome excesses of early 1970s living were left behind for a very good reason. They just weren't that much fun at all.",
            "Unless viewed through the prism of psychedelic habituates, it is unlikely audiences will find much to savour in Gilliam's picture. ",

            "The fear is comical; the loathing almost nonexistent. ",
            "Certainly uneven at times, but Terry Gilliam's surreal mood piece paints a vivid, splashy picture of gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson.",
            "A beautiful cinematic showcase for Thompson at the peak of his writing skills.",
            "It may start off as a lighthearted, excess-filled, party-road-trip movie, but Depp is reigned in a little towards the end as his character (a stand-in for Thompson) poetically bemoans the sad failure of the late-60s ideals and values.",
            "More headache than head trip.",
            "This is the best acid-inspired movie since Roger Corman's The Trip - and it is a darn sight more accurate in its depiction [of] the highs and the lows, the terrible confusion alternating with lucidity, the excitement that gives way to paranoia.",
            "...he first hour of the film is as successful as anything I've ever seen or read at conveying how the world looks to the drugged.",
            "Years from now, it will be reappraised as a misunderstood masterpiece. Well, this is one American critic who's not waiting until years from now.",
            "There is not enough of the drug dementia and too much philosophizing by Gilliam.",
            "Gilliam shows that there is something appealing about drug highs. It wouldn't be honest to say otherwise. And, yes, they'll destroy you. It's honest about that too."

            "The Spanish Prisoner shares with Glengarry Glen Ross a vision of life as a cosmic con game in which the victimizers feed the fantasies of the victims.",
            "David Mamet's most consistently enjoyable film to date is a cool, typically clever con-trick drama packed with deliciously inventive twists that get ever more convoluted and unnerving as the plot proceeds.",
            "There's something fresh, even restorative, in watching an American studio movie that doesn't treat the movie-going audience like a bunch of gullible marks.",
            "Mamet brings more than a decade's worth of filmmaking experience to his latest project, and his skill as a director has improved considerably.",
            "Mamet plays with our preconceived notions to keep us off-guard and unaware of the machinations unfolding beneath his fa\u00e7ade of already questionable activities.",
            "One exceedingly well-crafted piece of manipulation that keeps the audience strung along with every intricate turn of the plot.",
            "The result is rather frustrating -- the story works but feels oddly hollow, almost like a con game itself.",
            "This is probably Mamet's most purely enjoyable film since the gangster comedy Things Change.",
            "A reminder that even intelligent films can be exercises of style over substance.",
            "A substandard con flick that is surprisingly lightweight for a David Mamet film. In fact, it's so watered down that it feels more like a forgettable T.V. Movie-of-the-week.",
            "In David Mamet's world nothing is what it seems and nobody talks like a real person. The stylized dialogue is not a flaw--it's part of the entertainment. Mamet keeps you and star Campbell Scott guessing until the final moments.",
            "A very impressive movie, The Spanish Prisoner entertains mightily.",
            "An intriguing whodunit about murder and computer software, The Spanish Prisoner fails because for the most part, its actors aren't up to the task, and Mamet is unable to educate them properly.",
            "David Mamet's latest contraption has its satisfying moments, but the film is rarely more than just that: a contraption.",
            "By the end, the story does overrun the characters; but we only know them in a superficial way, so it seems natural for them to be secondary to the plot.",
            "Truly a great film, much smarter than most thrillers.",
            " It is a subtle and revealing drama about a confidence game filled with on-target insights into business, paranoia, deceit, pride, and entitlement. "

            "Woo disappoints on so many levels, lacking in wit and intelligence, characters with any sense of dimension and a coherent story line.",
            "A painfully graceless comedy that reworks After Midnight, Blind Date and Booty Call into something monstrous and untoward.",
            "The whole thing is rude and pathetic, more like a lengthy episode of a bad sitcom than a movie, chock full of the kind of sexual innuendoes that are guaranteed to please horny eighth-graders or people who laugh at those Playboy party jokes.",
            "This Manhattan-based romantic comedy might be fun if it didn't hit you over the head with a sledgehammer every few minutes.",
            "Pinkett Smith does just fine. She's sexy, funny and ironic and carries Woo as it ambles all over a Brooklyn night that's one long party.",
            "It would all be easier to take if the title character were presented with an ounce of charm. Woo is much too selfish, insensitive and narcissistic for audiences to want to buy her, and Smith is still much too self-conscious an actress to sell her.",
            "[A] truly awful disaster.",
            "Initially, Woo seems every bit the fun dating film that's guaranteed to give urban 20-somethings their six bucks of fulfillment. Unsurprisingly, it's no more than that, although at times its tenuous jokes add up to a bit less.",
            "A romantic comedy, it's such a sloppy mess that polishing it with all the Pledge in the world couldn't help brighten it up.",
            "Woo is proof that you can take a tired retread of a plot -- a blind date from hell -- and infuse it with just the right amount of freshness, style and vivacity to make it new again.",
            "As the film plods on, Woo's initial, slightly mysterious charm wilts from overexposure; the frantic antics fall flat and the whole contrived mess begins to feel increasingly obvious and boring.",
            "A graceless and gratingly unfunny comedy that brings out the worst in just about everybody involved.",
            "Equally unengaging are hero Tim (Davidson), the wimpish buppie who loves her, and his male buddies, who provide the requisite quota of chauvinism.",
            "Thank goodness Jada Pinkett Smith and Tommy Davidson are so much fun to watch. Without them, Woo would be another half-baked comedy bound for the oblivion bin.",
            "What characterization there is consists of weak, stupid men empowered by dominant, predatory women, encased in witless, tasteless commercial rubbish.",
            "Woo offers endless slapstick gags that are lame and obvious. Boxer shorts catch on fire, characters fall down at the most inopportune times, arguments are spawned by chaste hugs of friendship that are misunderstood by witnesses.",
            "Woo may be as skimpy as a sequined halter top, but it's undeniably appealing nonetheless.",
            "An incoherent romantic comedy whose sexy title character (played by Ms. Smith) is an unbearable, unfunny pain in the neck.",
            "The constant reliance upon unfunny, moronic humor sinks the project."

            "The contrast between Tucker's motormouth and Chan's man of few words should be funnier, but the plot -- which is cliched without quite becoming self-reflexive -- and the uneven pace dampen most of their moments.",

            "Rush Hour is a righteous title for an action comedy, and that's only the beginning.",
            "A vindication of what some of us have always known: that Jackie is a screen legend.",

            "Funny, well acted comedy from a new director whose career shuld be watched ",
            "Though hypocritical in the way it sensationalizes sexuality, this serious and funny 1998 movie about a 15-year-old coming to terms with her body and her family in 1976 is, refreshingly, never coy or ironic.",
            "A small film with plenty of incidental pleasures, writer/director Jenkins' debut feature puts a winning new spin on the adolescent comedy-drama.",
            "There's an alchemy that can transform personal experience into a great film, but it was nowhere nearby when Tamara Jenkins wrote and directed this lacklustre first feature.",
            "What lifts this brash comedy above the vulgar herd is Tamara Jenkins in a heartfelt feature debut as writer and director.",
            "Generally Jenkins shows few rookie jitters, and she got excellent performances from the rest of her cast.",
            "Tamara Jenkins' feature debut as a director and as a screenwriter [with certain autobiographical excerpts] is a dramatic comedy that is contagious to me. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Dark comedy about family dysfunction; sex, drugs, cursing. ",
            "...a slight movie but a brave one",
            "Uneven but filled with flashes of painful insight into the pitfalls awaiting adolescent girls.",

            "not as bad as the title makes it sound",
            "Not much humor here. The statement about white trash is lost in an incest subplot. Just a mess.",
            "A marvelous, fresh new coming-of-age comedy-drama, one that breathes fresh new life into the genre.",
            "Intelligent, humorous and thoroughly poignant, this can easily hold its own with the best comedies of the year.",
            "Terrific performances from Alan Arkin and Natasha Lyonne dominate this engrossing look at a financially strapped Jewish family trying to survive despite their penury.",
            "Lyonne is a natural, and clearly a young actress to watch.",

            "A flawed but powerful Shine-esque tale of love, music, and madness!",

            "Aronofsky, who has parlayed this movie's Sundance success into two Hollywood deals, is that rare indie filmmaker who doesn't want to make hip romantic sitcoms. He's a genuine experimenter with a spooky visual style.",
            "We share Max's feelings of imminent psychological disintegration as the film probes our own insecurity in the face of the eternal. Maths meets millennial doom in one of the decade's true originals.",
            "It's remarkable to what extent Aronofsky has rendered the cerebral kinetically intense. The film's imaginative, diverse images create a mind's-eye urban claustrophobia.",
            "Audacious and bursting with ideas.",
            "The movie's low-budget look neatly matches the claustrophobia of Max's life, but the filmmakers have also devised some special shooting methods for certain scenes. These sequences -- breathless and jangly chases, for the most part -- look terrific.",
            "Pi is a lesson to aspiring film makers everywhere: perfect your skills, be original, be bold. It's a pity young British directors aren't making films as unique and imaginative as this. Startlingly good cinema.",
            "...Aronofsky's taste for including horror in his films is evident from his very first feature...",
            "Restricted as an up-and-coming filmmaker, Aronofsky didn't conform to convention and instead delivered his art full throttle...",
            "A workout, no question, and not for everyone, but it has intellectual and spiritual fervor, and even when it stops dead for some mystical exposition, at least it assumes our intelligence (though also our patience).",
            "A tour-de-force of grainy, high-contrast black-and-white photography and inventive editing and sound design, &#960; at times ventures to the limits of cinematic legibility. ",
            "Pi accomplishes so much more with...its micro-budget than a Hollywood production could.",
            "a real treat",
            "Both story and style reveal the calculations of an artist so desperate to get noticed that he forgot to cover his id.",
            "Pi is certainly about the burden of genius, but it very well may also be about mythical powers and faulty dogma in Judaism.",
            "When the Torah is explained in mathematical terms, it's enough to make you want to take up second year trig - like the movie, a deeply flawed idea.",
            "Disturbing, exhilarating, and sure to send anyone of conservative temperament scuttling from the room.",
            "Clever and creepy as hell.",
            "...a frustrating and maddeningly confounding piece of work...",
            "Director Darren Aronofsky creates an eerie Eraserhead-like world that keeps the film compelling.",
            "An ambitious, stylish and intriguing first effort by Aronofsky and director of photography Matthew Libatique. If you're of a mind for an offbeat but fascinating film, give it a shot.",
            "Pi is an interesting film. Not a particularly good one, but interesting nonetheless.",
            "Embora Aronofsky cometa excessos visuais em alguns momentos (tend\u00eancia comprovada em seu trabalho seguinte, R\u00e9quiem para um Sonho), sua eficiente dire\u00e7\u00e3o, a \u00f3tima edi\u00e7\u00e3o e o inteligente roteiro transformam Pi em um filme singular.",
            "Shot in blotchy, grimy black-and-white and edited in a style almost reminiscent of the French New Wave, 'Pi' is as jarring to the eye as it is enticing to the mind."

            "Bittersweet, slow-moving period piece has sex, drugs.",

            "Quirky, acerbic, romantic comedy set in Manhattan during the early 1980s.",
            "Not only are the characters in The Last Days of Disco embarrassingly earnest about their love for spectacular nightclubs and thumping dance music, but they're also completely transparent about their desires, even when they think they're being clever.",
            "If it had been Stillman's swan song, a director could hardly hope to be prouder of such a strong exit. ",
            "Stillman skips the snark in favor of a sincere appreciation of his slightly lost characters.",
            "Stilillman pulls off a unique balancing act of conveying the specificities of the cultural milieu but also maintaining a sense of universality that keeps the film from being solely about its time and place",
            "The focus of The Last Days of Disco is a psychologically authentic and painfully parasitic female relationship.",

            "The intimate, idiosyncratic and very funny Buffalo '66 --directed by and starring Vincent Gallo, from a semi-autobiographical script co-authored with Alison Bagnall --feels like a projection of Gallo's very psyche.",
            "Vincent Gallo, gaunt and pop-eyed, with a gaze of sexy, hostile paranoia, has the look of a born sociopath or a born movie star (or both).",
            "Pic receives an incalculable boost from Ricci.",
            "Gallo's directorial debut is one of a kind, an eccentric, provocative comedy which laces a poignant love story with both a sombre, washed-out naturalism and surreal musical vignettes.",
            "There is a air of intriguing atavism about the textures and contours of Buffalo '66's visual style and tone.",
            "Performances are outstanding, particularly those of Gallo and Ricci. It`s so refreshing and invigorating to see a film like this.",
            "For a study in untrammeled lunacy, the movie is a highly constructed and tightly controlled work.",
            "Gallo's poor, poor pitiful me routine wears very thin, very fast, but Ricci is incandescent, a softly-glowing dumpling of a dream-girl in powder-blue fishnet tights and sparkly tap shoes.",
            "If Martin Scorsese, John Cassavetes, and Abel Ferrara took turns directing scenes of a film written by and starring Jerry Lewis, it might resemble Buffalo '66.",
            "Actor Vincent Gallo makes a feature directing debut with this bizarre, self-indulgent tale of a troubled guy, played by him in a narcissistic mode, who has never reconciled his unhappy childhood.",
            "It may not be the masterpiece that its narcissistic writer-director-star Vincent Gallo has claimed to be, but his filmmaking debut is a ceaselessly fascinating piece of work.",
            "Gallo transforma um personagem antip\u00e1tico e inst\u00e1vel em uma figura comovente, enquanto Ricci, em uma de suas atua\u00e7\u00f5es mais sensuais, quase rouba o filme.",
            "Funny and quirky, with a great performance by Ricci. Gallo quickly grows annoying, though.",
            "Gallo and Ricci? Can you possibly go wrong? Well, maybe if you tried to be conventional, but there's no danger of that here.",
            "Buffalo '66 left me confused and unsatisfied, yet it's not an easy movie to dismiss.",
            "Occasionally inventive but too willing to laze about in its own determined strangeness.",

            "It's a beautifully structured piece with a high quotient of neat, shocking twists. Director David Dobkin exercises welcome restraint; although the movie is full of macabre touches, it's witty rather than grotesque."

            "Embracing Hartley's motifs, such as the vicissitudes of fame and fate, the film is sharply uneven, meditative and touching in moments but also pretentious and overlong; it's the last decent movie Hartley has made.",
            "Has some good acting and ideas, but Hartley doesn't seem to know how to end the thing.",
            " The complexities and weirdness of popular culture provide the backdrop for this black comedy about creativity, politics, publishing, and mentors. ",
            "In better sync with its content, but its story, too, of an individual living in a dumpster world trying to share what he knows and make it sing, is undeniably moving.",

            "[Saving Private Ryan] accomplishes something I had been taught was most difficult -- making an action-filled anti-war film or, at least, one that doesn't in some way glorify or lie about combat.",
            "Steven Spielberg's film is not perfect: it plays its strongest card first, the middle section is slightly uneven, and there are sallies into sentimentality. But it is a modern war classic.",
            "Saving Private Ryan is a masterpiece. It cements Steven Spielberg's reputation as one of the seminal filmmakers of the era.",
            "The result, I am sorry to say, is that Saving Private Ryan seems almost banal in its achievement, a film that sacrifices humanity for technical wizardry.",
            "One of the most impactful, immersive war movies of all time, Steven Spielberg's cinematic achievement takes us as close to the front line as possible offering a human take on the chaos of war.",
            "The opening moments on Omaha Beach are surely the most memorable of the entire film.",
            "After a gut-wrenchingly graphic opening that re-stages the D-Day landing in a numbing fine detail - arguably the greatest war-movie scene of them all - it is impossible not to be caught up in this classic drama for the long haul.",
            "The story raises hard moral questions relating to the relative value of human lives and the overwhelming debt that may be felt by those who benefit when others sacrifice.",
            "Spielberg is at his absolute best here, with the true stroke of genius being the camera work and editing.",
            "A masterpiece in every sense of the word .",
            "Not simply a 1990s classic or among the better prestige films of my generation, Saving Private Ryan is a stone cold masterpiece ranking among the very best war films of all time.",
            "No audience can resist it. You may walk out of the theater rich with indignation at the shamelessness of it all, but you cannot get rid of the lump in your throat.",
            "Steven Spielberg's war film, Saving Private Ryan, not only redefined the genre for war movies but the film holds up on the 20th anniversary.",
            "After a generation of films revisiting Vietnam, Steven Spielberg steered Hollywood back to the pride and accomplishment of \"the greatest generation.\"",
            "One of Spielberg's most difficult \"problem\" films.",
            "The film is directed by Steven Spielberg, and breaks new ground in content and style. It merges some of the most realistically disturbing battle footage ever included in a feature film with a touching human story.",
            "This is Spielberg's way of showing that these warriors were ordinary men -- men who, if they survived, became the grandfathers and great-grandfathers who, these days, pass largely unnoticed through life.",
            "If Steven Spielberg's emotional intelligence matched his visual genius, his harrowing, passionately felt and honorably flawed new film might qualify for one of the greatest American movies ever made about World War II.",
            "Spielberg is telling his fellow Americans to appreciate the sacrifices their forebears have made and to act accordingly.",
            "Spielberg puts us through the hair-trigger terrors of combat in a way no other filmmaker has ever dared, and yet there's a gentleness to his enterprise. He's interested in the humaneness that comes through the horror.",
            "Spielberg's latest masterwork, pairing America's director with '90s Everyman Tom Hanks, makes a natural companion piece to his similarly disturbing Schindler's List.",
            "Spielberg's typically overindulgent sensibilities mute the impact of the film's more overtly captivating moments."

            "It is a most relaxed and enjoyable look at the neurotic comic, who appears to be no different in this documentary from the way he is in his films.",
            "[Kopple] might seem an unlikely choice for this material, but no doubt her track record gained Allen's trust."

            "It's a lovely daydream, made lovelier by the fiercely maternal performance of Sarandon as a lioness protecting her cubs, and Julia Roberts as a mass of insecurity trying to measure up to impossible standards.",
            "Well, if unearned pathos is your cup of tea, drink up.",
            "Under Chris Columbus' direction, they make a pretty but utterly misleading picture in which cheap sentiment is used to supply easy, false resolutions to agonizing issues.",
            "The result is a cartoonish two-hour-plus soap opera of little distinction, played by actors who deserve better and should have known better.",
            "A disjointed hybrid of domestic comedy and mortal illness that might have been written by a support group of lobotomy survivors.",
            "Chris Columbus directs as if he's handling a moral diagram: Stepmom is so full of understanding it made me want to throw up.",
            "If you're going to make children say such terrible things, you should at least back it up with a movie about divorce and death that is sincere and penetrating. In other words, the type of film that Chris Columbus wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole.",
            "Stepmom is a piece of formulaic Hollywood product that's barely redeemed by its three fine leads and top notch production values. It suffers in comparison to the similar, but far better, One True Thing.",
            "Were it not for the stellar acting of Sarandon (the most infectious weeper this side of Brenda Blethyn) and Julia Roberts (irresistible as ever) the whole predictable enterprise would be too mawkish for words.",
            "Stepmom is highly effective filmmaking, eliciting its fair share of laughter and sobs, even though the least gullible moviegoers will be able to see all the melodramatic machinery cranking and groaning behind the curtains.",
            "Though Stepmom has its ups and downs, it shows Columbus as a director who has graduated to adulthood after his two Home Alone hits without losing sight of the struggles of children.",
            "Roberts holds her own with a very attractive performance, admittedly given that hers is the character who is likeable, good-humoured and too good to be true.",
            "The critic feels cheated, but all around him the audience is happily weeping.",
            "Despite its unappealing title, this is an incredibly touching and sophisticated film about life after divorce that examines the tricky issue of bringing a new partner into the family set-up.",
            "It is hard to credit that it took five credited writers to assemble this slender, contrived and heavily padded concoction, directed with unremitting blandness by Chris Columbus.",
            "Much of Stepmom's success is due to its three appealing lead players, all of whom lend class and intelligence to the enterprise.",
            "It's a film about a woman who lives for other people and who wears the requisite hunted expression. If this woman wasn't Sarandon, then Stepmom would be altogether hopeless.",
            "[Stepmom] offers some useful insights into how feelings of jealousy and betrayal can limit the potential of family relationships. But these ideas are more or less undermined by the movie's maddeningly typical glamorizing of illness.",
            "Stepmom plays just this side of icky, pulling at the heartstrings as if hitched to a Mack truck.",
            "It's a hardened soul who can bear the last 10 minutes without reaching for the Kleenex.",
            "The movie is reasonably smart and touching when it deals with the plight of a family on the rocks, but it pushes too many emotional buttons.",
            "Many viewers will be brushing away tears by the final reel, but even those who remain dry-eyed will be won over by the powerful performances that bring the film's universal themes to life.",
            "Contrived yet effective family weepie."

            "Adler's screenplay is excellent; it isn't often that a film takes an insightful look at how people can become unraveled.",

            "The fondant-fancy colours make the film all the more escapist, yet some pop songs can pierce you to the core.",
            "The result is uncommonly pleasing or defiantly twee: take your choice.",
            "A luminous musical about dreams, romance and destiny which lovingly reworks the classic Hollywood 'putting on a show' template into an essay on the emotional rollercoaster ride that is movie-going.",
            "Reminiscent of a Shakespearean comedy and seems to tap into a romantic yearning that is hardwired into our DNA. Absolutely sublime.",
            "This follow-up to The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is the French at their least charming, being a nearly unbearably coy Gallic imitation of an MGM musical dating from the heyday of Gene Kelly.",
            "It must be allowed that [Jacques] Demy is an habitual offender on the count of sentimentality... yet he is capable of a tender, unsentimenial euphoria more intoxicating than any other film work in the field of sentimental farce.",
            "Life's regrets aren't often the basis of a movie musical, yet French director Jacques Demy is best known for his two films that fit that exact description. ",
            "They have very impressive dancing throughout and all the costumes and colors are so dazzling.",
            "From its opening jazzy dance on a ferry, which becomes a veritable magic carpet floating above a sparkling river before the scene is over, it's a delight.",
            "If Hollywood is the dream factory, Demy's The Young Girls of Rochefort is one heck of a factory knock-off. And being French, it has an oblique ending that also seems to have influenced [La La Land].",
            "Hit musical La La Land drew inspiration from The Young Girls of Rochefort and it deserves revisitation; it is one of the greatest films of the 1960s.",
            "The true pleasures of The Young Girls of Rochefort are its smaller touches.",
            "The results are a bit like eating too much ice cream sundae.",
            "A very welcome rerelease of Demy's delightful 1967 musical.",
            "An intriguing mix of French New Wave and Hollywood Musical, this still succeeds in sweeping you off your feet.",
            "A decidedly old-fashioned delight.",
            "There's something irresistibly swinging, even promiscuous, about the whole affair.",
            "What makes the film so lovable and still so gladsomely alive today is how closely it hews to Demy's distinctive, celebratory vision of life.",
            "It has charm, sustained human observation, mixed with catchy music, dances and songs to come up as a tuner with grace and dynamism.",
            "Life affirming dance routines, the wonderful music of Michel Legrand and effervescent presence of Catherine Deneuve, her real life sister Fran\u00e7oise Dorl\u00e9ac, George Chakiris and Gene Kelly; what more could you want?",
            "I like it better than the decidedly more grim The Umbrellas of Cherbourg."

            "Each change of angle and shift of light evokes an inner disturbance; the actors seem to push through the dense shadow as through water, revealing fast people in slow motion ...",
            "Direction by Jacques Tourneur pays close attention to mood development, achieving realistic flavor that is further emphasized by real life settings and topnotch lensing by Nicholas Musuraca.",
            "The most delicate and nuanced of film noirs, graced with a reflective lyricism that almost lifts it out of the genre.",
            "All these B movie poets were under contract to RKO in the winter of 1946, and produced the best movie of everyone involved -- once seen, never forgotten.",
            "An archetypal film noir featuring bright white lights, extra dark shadows, heavy rain, perpetually lit cigarettes, and a generous portion of flashback storytelling.",
            "[Jacques] Tourneur's pacing and tempo is flawless, and [Robert] Mitchum in a trench coat and full of taciturn machismo is on par with Bogie, who owned the trademark.",

            "Essential viewing for the noir fan and the kind of movie that could make a neutral third party into a noir fan in the first place.",
            "In a genre full of desperate characters scrambling and plotting to grab their slice of the American dream, Jacques Tourneur's Out of the Past (1947) is a hard-boiled tale of betrayal with an unusually haunting quality.",
            "Out Of The Past is undeniably a film noir, and rightly regarded as one of the genre's best. ",
            "'Maybe we thought the world would end,' Mitchum muses, during a short-lived spell of happiness in Mexico. 'Maybe we thought it was a dream.' A dream? In his trench coat and fedora, he's clearly not a man destined to die quietly in his bed.",
            "[VIDEO ESSAY] One of the best-loved '40s era contributions to the film noir genre, Director Jacques Tourneur's \"Out of the Past\" (1947) is a definitive model.",
            "Few films noir were better than this.",
            "Jacques Tourneuer's most accomplished film and a great sampler of film noir, sort of a textbook both visually and thematically.",
            "Out of the Past should be considered a prototypical example of how to do noir the right way--shadowy corners, double crossings aplenty, a luscious femme fatale, and, of course, murders.",
            "What makes \"Out of the Past\" stand out among the film noir classics is that it has better actors, a better screenplay and it doesn't look like it was made on the cheap.",
            "Beautiful thriller, with haunting direction.",
            "An irresistible blend of postwar fatalism, hard-boiled dialogue, dangerous sex and luscious black-and-whites ... the slouching, sleepy-eyed Mitchum is arguably the consummate noir hero.",
            "One of the greatest of all film noirs.",
            "The first starring role for Robert Mitchum (both John Garfield and Dick Powell turned down the part) is a beauty."

            "Finally, an Adam Sandler comedy that you can sit through without wanting to throw a mallet through the screen.",

            "At its best, it is a gentle, well-portrayed, feel good film.",
            "A sparkling romantic comedy, the kind of picture that glides by so gracefully and unpretentiously that it's only upon reflection that you realize how much skill, caring and good judgment had to have gone into its making.",
            "There's some cheap nostalgia at play here (okay, maybe a lot) but it's more than made up for with genuine laughs and a ton of heart. ",
            "Puppy charm, retro-hip and some good old-fashioned romantic chemistry lift a traditional comedy to the brighter realms of a pleasant, quirky and genuinely touching slice of matinee entertainment.",
            "The chemistry between Sandler and Barrymore is something special to see here, and I think 'The Wedding Singer' ends up being Sandler's best movie. ",
            "Not the most original comedy, but many will enjoy.",
            "The tone set by director Frank Coraci tends to the cartoonishly broad while making jokes at the expense of grotesques. [Blu-ray]",
            "Although the movie is remarkably schmaltzy, it's sweet and affecting, too, with Sandler's character as genuinely nice as he can be.",
            "Called on to replace some of his Happy Gilmore shtick with the emoting of a romantic lead, he does just that but in an unpersuasive on/off fashion.",
            "Yes, it's sappy. It's also silly, utterly unironic, a sketch stretched out to feature length, and, if you're in the right mood, pretty darned cute.",
            "Barrymore and Sandler are lovely together, and the movie, set in 1985, was also among the first to tap into 1980s nostalgia.",
            "The plotting is simplistic but cute and the gags are consistently funny, particularly for anyone who grew up in the 1980s.",
            "It's charmingly bad and an excellent date film.",
            "Uneven and silly? Yes. Enjoyable? Most definitely.",
            "An hour and a half of solid entertainment.",
            "Fairly typical comedy, in that moments of genuine humor are spread out too thinly over a schmaltzy (sorry, \"heartwarming\") script. But how can you give a failing grade to a movie that spotlights silly early Eighties music?",
            "Besides music that harks back to the days when MTV was worth watching (Martha Quinn Forever!), The Wedding Singer is also a sweet, beguiling romantic comedy.",

            "A moderately suspenseful thriller that seems somewhat conventional compared to De Palma's earlier envelope-pushing efforts. Intriguing, but the mystery villain is rather obvious from the start.",

            "Though director Andy Tennant was enthusiastic about putting this kind of spin on Cinderella, his touch turns out to be counterproductive.",
            "The best Cinderella movie ever.",

            "An affable film that helped affirm Drew Barrymore's place in the Hollywood firmament as something cosier than a one-trick wild child.",
            "Once upon a time there was a feisty young woman who didn't sit around twiddling her pretty thumbs and singing \"Someday My Prince Will Come.\"",
            "A delightful movie, full of feisty, three-dimensional characters romping through comedy, romance and otherwise gloriously colorful moments.",
            "Drew Barrymore is delightful as Danielle, straightforward yet provocative, beautiful even when her face is smeared with the ashes from the fireplace.",
            "You won't see a fairy godmother flitting from scene to scene. Nor will a pumpkin magically transform into a chariot.",
            "The real magic is found in Andrew Dunn's stunningly lovely photography, which makes every scene look like a vintage storybook illustration.",
            "One of the year's best films.",
            "The bottom line is: it's cute. And it's relatively inoffensive.",
            "There are a few nice moments when Barrymore's acting talent shines through, and the same can be said for Huston and Scott. But as a romantic comedy, this film is only slightly above average.",
            "A high-spirited Renaissance romance starring the thoroughly modern Drew Barrymore.",
            "Barrymore aces her 16th-century elocution, but her vampy magnetism -- always her dominant charm -- is snuffed in this goody-goody role.",
            "An enchanting rendition of the classic Cinderella tale set in sixteenth century France."

            "A richly acted - see especially Robert Duvall's dreamy-fox opposition lawyer - subtly suspenseful, blessedly unmoralizing morality play.",
            "Based on a true story, this is an intelligent legal thriller, very much in the mode of 1970s issue-oriented films, that may be too subtle and complex for the damands of today's market.",
            "Delivering the verdict two thirds into the movie is anti-climactic, while Schlichtmann's belated atonement feels beside the point.",
            "A fine script from director Steven Zaillian gives all involved plenty to chew.",
            "As proficient a job as writer-director Steve Zaillian and his team do, A Civil Action has unmistakably unraveled by its close.",
            "This is a case in which the material really is better served in book form.",
            "The movie becomes one more David-and-Goliath morality play.",
            "While Travolta is passable as Schlichtmann, it is the outstanding work from Duvall, Macy and briefly Tony Shalhoub that drive the story.",
            "I expected a harder hitting indictment against the uncaring power of corporate America. Instead, we get a middlin' courtroom drama that lacks the intensity of such films as the 1982 Sidney Lumet/Paul Newman film, The Verdict.",
            "the film is slightly overlong and the ending is anti-cathartic.",
            "... hints at the complex moral issues that vein the story.",
            "A legal drama that doesn't follow the usual Hollywood-John Grisham formula.",
            "neatly avoids slipping into melodrama, and despite plenty of niggling minor faults along the way the movie finally succeeds. With a more comfortably cast lead actor it could have been even more powerful.",
            "The film is so daring because it features a protagonist that we cannot and do not sympathize with.",
            "My only real problem is with the script.",
            "More complex, subtle, perplexing and memorable than the usual courtroom theatrics.",
            "It's not bad, but with everything else out there, I won't recommend it.",
            "Just when it seemed the courtroom drama was suffering a fatal case of John Grisham, A Civil Action\" rescues the genre.",
            "Though the plot plays largely by the numbers, Zaillian treats the material with a welcome level of maturity that manages to sustain interest even when the storyline doesn't."

            "The same year's Antz is the better film (at least for adults), though there's plenty to enjoy in what over the long term has been revealed as a relatively minor Pixar project.",
            "The writing all around is really good.",
            "An entirely beguiling little adventure that advancing technology and a vastly different marketplace haven't robbed of its merits.",
            "The colours are vivid, the detail incredible and the vocal performances, led by Foley, are fine. Happily, it works on both a child's and adult's level.",

            "The witty dialog and contemporary humor keep things interesting and entertaining for the adults out there. The kids, even younger ones, have plenty to keep them occupied for 96 minutes.",

            "Overall, this is a lovely film, ranking with the best of Disney's animated features while taking on rather serious issues of war, honor, gender roles and family pride.",
            "What's terrific about Mulan is its reaching for emotions that other movies run from: family love and duty, personal honor and group commitment, obedience and ingenuity.",
            "Goes about halfway toward setting new boundaries for Disney's, and the industry's, animated features, but doesn't go far enough.",
            "Using richly hued, angular animation, this vibrant, action-filled Disney offering is immensely entertaining.",
            "A disappointment for anyone hoping the studio would raise the standard of the animated feature to a new level.",
            "The film shines at capturing the watercolor delicacy of China's past.",
            "Mulan is a well-animated tale that can still inspire.",
            "...the show tunes and sidekicks are largely unnecessary.",
            "Even though Mulan is a brave, strong hero, her motivation for entering the army has nothing to do with her own ambitions and everything to do with serving patriarchy (represented by her father and her emperor).",
            "The backdrops are also beautifully drawn with a watercolor flair. There are a lot of little touches like that which help it feel rich and textured.",
            "Disney animation depends on captivating music, powerful villains, and effective comic relief, and Mulan has all three. ",
            "What is chiefly impressive is that the appropriation of Chinese iconography in a film that was plainly made by Western animators feels ultimately so natural and successful.",
            "From the first scene onwards, you know you're in good hands.",
            "Female heroes permeate most of Disney's animated movies, but this is the first time they've given her real strength.",
            "This is the best Disney animated feature, ever (involving extensive use of cross-dressing).",
            "Continues Disney's dominance of the animation field with its solid, assured story-telling, good main and supporting characters and superior craftsmanship.",
            "In the end, Mulan isn't bad - it's just mediocre, which is particularly disappointing given its Disney pedigree.",
            "remains squarely in the realm of family entertainment, but it's lush and effective as such (if a little more violent than usual)",
            "Neither fish nor fowl, though it certainly leans towards foul",
            "A fascinating and artistically animated movie that's worth seeing more than once.",
            "To its credit, Mulan does strive to present its characters as something more than potential Happy Meal toys.",
            "The animators have clearly done their research, but while the film's cultural specificity isn't distasteful per se, it's still pretty soulless.",
            "A great family film, suitable for almost any age."

            "Bulworth is an angry movie, but Beatty is savvy enough to recognize that people respond better to comedies than serious \"issue films,\" so he has camouflaged his message beneath the surface of this original, incisive satire.",
            "Bulworth plays like a cry of frustrated comic rage. It's about an archetypal character who increasingly seems to stand for our national mood: the guy who's fed up and isn't going to take it anymore.",
            "A shrewd political observer for decades, Beatty has fashioned a hilarious morality tale that delivers a surprisingly potent, angry message beneath the laughs.",
            "As writer, director and star, Beatty flails all over the screen, but he's also made the only recent political satire that draws blood.",
            "Beatty is to be congratulated on even attempting to prick America's conscience in these conservative times, but the real reason for seeing it is the panache with which it captures the irresistible flash and filigree of American politics.",

            "Beatty is a very shielded actor, but he shrewdly finds ways to work within his limitations, and Bulworth is a tour-de-force for him.",
            "Jaw-droppingly abysmal. Seldom has a major star embarrassed himself so badly.",
            "While the ending is predictable and unsatisfying, the political issues that the film raises (racism, et. al) are worthy of further discussion.",
            "one of the hardest-hitting and unblinkingly brave political satires to hit American screens since \"Dr. Strangelove.\"",
            "A middling funny film with a good, if silly, performance by Warren Beatty, and not much more.",
            "An effective satire that deserves recommendation.",
            "Beatty's contribution to the ranks of recent political satire is bold, merciless and frequently very funny, and his performance is just plain fearless.",

            "At the end of Mr. Lee's movie, all you feel is the distraction of Mr. Lee's stylistic exhibitionism, without which, I concede, he might not be regarded as a genius in some quarters.",
            "[Lee] gets a charming performance from Allen, who, in his acting debut, occupies his pedestal with grace and diffidence.",
            "As usual, Lee tries many kinds of stylistic effects and uses wall-to-wall music (by Aaron Copland and Public Enemy); what's different this time is how personally driven the story feels.",
            "Most scenes play too long, with a surplus of ideas, textures, tones and characters, and after 134 minutes it's clear Lee's problem with closure hasn't gone away.",
            "Spike Lee sports drama has strong language, violence, sex. ",
            "A long, boring, meandering, dog of a movie.",
            "Lee's attack on how big business is not only ruining the game he loves but also playing with people's lives is direct and brave, while his passion, insight and intelligence are evident and admirable.",
            "Though too long by a good half hour, Lee's latest film packs a genuine emotional punch.",
            "Lee paints intimate characters who are about more than the game. Themes of integrity, honesty, loyalty and familial love are woven through the film resulting in a complex, thought-provoking human drama.",
            "Shrewdly exposes the underbelly of college recruiting and the pressures exerted on talented high school basketball stars.",
            "Flawed but powerful.",
            "It is a wonderful thing to watch two artists work so well together. I am speaking, in this case, of Spike Lee and Denzel Washington.",
            "The hypocritical misogyny of He Got Game is a fundamental weakness that reviewers so far have been happy to downplay or even to dismiss.",
            "Lee should have drawn up a tighter game plan but just the same his hoops hoopla still has enough game (mostly in the form of Washington) to win over the audience.",
            "As brilliant and perplexing as the filmmaker himself.",
            "Only a director as good as Spike Lee could make a coherent movie out of this messy, jejune set-up ...",
            "Washington's Jake Shuttlesworth looks tough and hard, an odd but refreshing turn for an actor long associated with handsomely heroic roles.",
            "As much a technical achievement as a narrative one.",
            "A two-hour air ball.",
