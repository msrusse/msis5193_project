            "Lacking a firm center in Frodo's story, the film plays itself out as a bewildering parade of elves, dwarves, ores, trolls and talking trees.",
            "It looked terrible then and it still does: cartoon characters move differently from live actors, and the attempt to duplicate natural movement ends in stylistic incoherence.",
            "Quite simply, those who do not know the characters of Middle Earth going in will not know them coming out.",
            "Bakshi's version, using animation and live-action tracings, is uniformly excellent, sticking closely to the original text and visually echoing many of Tolkien's own drawings.",
            "The film is visually compelling even when murk overtakes the narrative.",
            "Falls far short of the charm and sweep of the original story.",
            "Ralph Bakshi achieves spectacular effects. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "A film that, despite its palpable narrative shortages, is not only fascinating regarding its visual commitment, but also because it laid a strong base for the material shot by Jackson a quarter of a century later. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "[W]e should be grateful that Bakshi has tried so hard to be faithful to the original that its spirit and inspiration often shine through to stir the blood.",
            "A genuine cult movie ",
            "Bakshi proves once again that he is a master of his chosen medium.",
            "Lord of the Rings never makes that wondrous leap to the land of the imagination.",
            "Ralph Bakshi's imagination was on the Fritz; his animated version of Tolkien's fable made Middle-earth look like Grand Central Station during the rush hour of the Ores.",
            "It seems less concerned with Tolkien than the West Coast drug culture of the mid-1970s and as a herald of New Ageism.",
            "Full of epic effects and breathtaking battles the film reflects Bakshi's ingenuity, with photographic imagery and light show effects expanding the limits of the palette used in previous animation features.",
            "It's a divisive film but I appreciate some of the choices that it made.",
            "Even the most magical fantasy falls to earth if it's not clear who's who and what's happening, as every maker of fables should know.",
            "Tolkien fans, who are familiar with novels, will find it enjoyble, while others may be confused by the action.",
            "Innovative and beautiful, cheesy and disjointed.",
            "What most people remember is the mix of the live-action tracing within the traditional animation and just how effectively creepy it managed to be, but for the time this did a pretty good job of adapting the dense novels.",
            "It's a reckless film, blitzing through some plot points and stalling out over others; the lack of a particular rhythm does not do it any favors, and it is certainly not a fast 133 minutes.",
            "A contemporary viewing of The Lord of the Rings is an exercise in outlandishness as well as nostalgia: dreamlike, peculiar.",
            "Animated adventure too dated and dark for younger kids.",
            "The live action version trumps it in every conceivable way; there simply is no comparison. And yet Middle Earth is still better off for its presence."

            "It's Gary Busey's galvanizing solo performance that gives meaning to an otherwise shapeless and bland feature-length film about the American rock-and-roll star who was killed in a plane crash in 1959.",

            "An extraordinary performance by Gary Busey as the early rock'n'roll star gives life to this otherwise ordinary film.",
            "Ultimately, the success of the film rests on Gary Busey's performance. Not since we saw the young Montgomery Clift and James Dean in their earliest roles has an actor emerged with so sharp and instantly empathetic a persona.",

            "Ethereal, gorgeous, and evocative.",
            "Unforgettable 1978 love triangle drama includes violence. ",
            "The refusal to privilege the 'big' over the 'small' is present in all of Malick's work, but it finds its first fully-realized expression here.",
            "The writing is witty, the story is told with a beguiling simplicity and the period is meticulously realised, not only in farming equipment and costume, but in attitudes and faces.",

            "One of the most visually impressive American films ever made, Days of Heaven fulfilled the promise that Terrence Malick had shown in Badlands",
            "It has a visual syntax so eloquent -- its fields of gold cause its quiet characters to stand out like mythic figures -- it would play powerfully as a silent film. ",
            "The images of workers in their landscape look like impressionist paintings that cinematographer Almendros creates on the screen with the natural light of his locations.",
            "A truly beautiful photographed film.",

            "...a strong first effort from a filmmaker who would go onto much bigger and better things.",

            "Beatty can carry off this sort of whimsy by playing it straight and keeping the ludicrous premise credible. But the film is dogged by the nagging vision of what might have been.",
            "This is a very sweet movie to watch, the pleasant cinematic equivalent of light summer reading.",
            "[The film] has everything going for it: big laughs, populist politics, billowy sequences set in heaven, a murder plot, a climactic Super Bowl game, a supporting cast of choice comic actors, and best of all, a touching (but PG) romance.",
            "Heaven Can Wait is an outstanding film.",
            "It's certainly likable enough and was a big hit when it came out, but one could hardly call it an auspicious artistic debut -- a crafty commercial entertainment with a certain amount of intelligence is more like it.",
            "The film drags its feet uncertainly from beginning to end.",
            "Along the way there is fun, football, romance and thoroughly satisfying unreality. Movies are supposed to be like this.",
            "What sounds excruciatingly whimsical has been woven into one of the funniest and gentlest movies since the '40s.",
            "A pleasant little puff piece that is sure to be just loved by most of those who see it.",
            "It's charming, witty, touching, and despite its previous incarnation, still fresh and original.",
            "Still-relevant '70s comic fantasy has some profanity.",
            "This updated version of the 1941 film Here Comes Mr Jordan is one of the few remakes that is almost as good as the original.",
            "Supremely produced, this whimsical romantic comedy served as star vehicle for Julie Christie and Warren Beatty, who made an impressive co-directing debut with Buck Henry; the film deservedly won the Oscar for Art Direction.",
            "There are a few laughs from Grodin and Cannon, but Beatty and Christie are like 400-pound gorillas chasing a milkweed seed.",
            "Frivolous and amusing in spots.",
            "A comedy classic.....if you've never seen it, you have to ask yourself...why?",
            "There's nothing worse than a pushy narrative.",
            "A really enjoyable high concept comedy; better than the 2000 remake!",

            "Mr. Reynolds has made a movie to please fans of all persuasions, and to please them a great deal.",
            "A lot of people and things are variously punched and smashed, and a good time is had by all.",
            "One of the least offensive Needham-and-Reynolds efforts, but that isn't saying much.",
            "A highly entertaining tribute to Hollywood stuntmen. The best of the Burt Reynolds-Hal Needham collaborations.",
            "Slight yet likable stuntman comedy.",
            "Guilty pleasure stunt-guy flick. Worth it for the final stunt of the film.",
            "Any film with Robert Klein as the villain can't be all bad",
            "Director Needham had graduated from being a stuntman to direct Smokey and the Bandit, but you would have to dig deep to find any great insight into the trade."

            "While it's fair to argue that The Deer Hunter contains moments of brilliance, the film as a whole is undone by its length.",
            "The movie won five Oscars and, if anything, improves with age.",
            "It has no more moral intelligence than the Clint Eastwood action pictures, yet it's an astonishing piece of work, an uneasy mixture of violent pulp and grandiosity, with an enraptured view of common life -- poetry of the commonplace.",
            "In trying to measure the devastating impact of Vietnam on the lives of three American soldiers, Cimino brings home the true horror of that senseless conflict in a way that the 6 O'Clock News never could.",
            "The film ultimately works because of the inherent dramatics of the script, the magnificent cinematography/editing and the performances of Walken, DeNiro and Streep. ",
            "A decidedly bitter, realistic, and harrowing anti-war epic.",
            "The depiction of Vietnam, and then the subsequent aftermath in the third act of the film, is more potent and visceral because we feel the impact of the war on an entire community, not just on the three men we follow there.",
            "Powerfully acted by all involved (especially Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep) and infused with numerous gut-wrenching scenes.",
            "...certainly a bit long and could use some trimming.",
            "Totally unforgettable.",
            "[The Deer Hunter] is the most ambitious attempt to grapple with the subject that has yet been released. Its vision -- an effort to weave the inferno of Vietnam into the homespun texture of American life -- is effectively realized and savagely gripping.",
            "The director, Michael Cimino, on his second movie, has an incredible, prodigal gift for making movies, knowing that editing is the shape and life behind film.",
            "The Deer Hunter is a work of staggering scope and ambition: an epic treatise on the malignancy running through American civilian and political life in the 1970s.",
            "Just crazy enough to capture something of the madness of Vietnam, domesticated enough that it's mostly something concrete that you put your arms around.",
            "Epic war drama is extremely intense and graphically violent. ",
            "The performances are unforgettable, particularly by Christopher Walken as the dreamy, masochistic, Russian-looking Nick.",
            "The Deer Hunter is a rich and powerful picture that without a trace of patronisation or the slightest touch of cultural superiority, speaks eloquently for the inarticulate.",
            "A powerful film made with impressive style, and one of the key films of the decade.",
            "Michael Cimino's Oscar-winning epic The Deer Hunter brought the emotional, homefront legacy of the Vietnam War vividly to life for audiences around the world.",
            "The idea of sacrifice permeates everything, along with the cruelty and horror. This is Cimino's masterpiece.",
            "Heart-on-sleeve stuff that works despite some of its more egregious impulses.",
            "Impressively, Cimino manages to fluctuate involvingly between cynicism and compassion in what feels like a three hour cinematic ache."
