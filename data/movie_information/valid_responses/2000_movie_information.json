            "\"M:I-2,\" as the new Mission: Impossible is tagged, is a slick, expensive, bullet-ridden thriller that is oddly dull -- the last thing you'd expect.",
            "Woo lays on his own particular high-octane stylishness so thick the results edge perilously toward self-parody.",
            "If the first movie was entertaining as sound, fury and movement, this one is more evolved, more confident, more sure-footed in the way it marries minimal character development to seamless action.",
            "For all my profound reservations about the whole project, I wound up liking it more, or, at least disliking it less, than I had anticipated. Thandie Newton is the biggest reason.",
            "Woo's hysterically hyper visuals and boytoy gimmickry can't camouflage the emptiness of the enterprise.",
            "The prolonged excess of a climax that is made even longer by the incessant inclusion of slow motion seems to want to compensate for the practical nonexistence of the action in more than half of the footage. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "It's fairly disappointing to note, ultimately, that Mission: Impossible II rarely comes close to replicating the consistent thrills and excitement of its vastly superior predecessor...",
            "John Woo's summer blockbuster is surely the most elegant and graceful example of cinema's technology advanced comeuppance so far.",
            "Watch it for completionist-sake ... but in a series with very self-contained entries, (this film) isn't really necessary or recommended.",
            "Woo's signature visual ballistics and predilection for highly wrought melodrama of the kind Douglas Sirk might be proud are imprinted on virtually every frame",
            "John Woo's Mission: Impossible 2 is the biggest film of the year so far, and it's nothing, nothing at all. No one will like it much. No one will love it.",
            "The worst of John Woo's American films (though that is a competitive race).",
            "Still a fun movie even if it doesn't match the high standards of the rest of the series thanks to Woo bringing his trademark over the top action sequences.",
            "Good thrill ride of a movie for teens and older.",
            "This will go down on my list as the better sequels.",
            "Here, Woo just seems to fall back on slow-mo whenever he gets bored, which apparently is often.",
            "With all this having been done before, making MI2 interesting or suspenseful truly is an impossible mission.",
            "It doesn't matter how many extra months the director spends creating impressive action scenes. If the audience is not emotionally invested in the fate of the heroes, no amount of explosions will make them care.",
            "The makers don't go out of their way to make this original in any way, but the quality comes through.",
            "This sequel seems afraid of confusing people, so much so that it dumbs down the plot to an insulting level.",
            "A more coherent and romantic script."

            "In his third, most accomplished film, LaBute puts aside the inquiry of misogyny that dominated his previous work and immerses himself in a lighter romantic fable about the collision of fantasy and reality, with a terrific performance from Renee Zelwegger",
            "Almost every emotion and action on view is presented as false, idiotic or superficial.",
            "LaBute didn't write Nurse Betty, but his fierce comic touch is, luckily, all over this movie.",
            "A triumph for Mr. LaBute as it is for its cast, because its success is so dependent on its sustaining a precarious balance between humor and pathos, realism and fantasy.",
            "This comedy has a few violent scenes.",
            "Good performances all around, especially from Zellweger and Kinnear. Lots of good laughs laced with nastiness.",
            "This is easily Ms. Zellweger's finest work.",
            "After a summer of cookie-cutter comedies and blowsy action flicks, Neil LaBute's Nurse Betty is good for what ails you.",
            "Despite cringing at many of Betty's deluded interactions with the residents of her final destination and the director's seeming lack of faith in the believability of many of the scenes, Nurse Betty still turns out to be entertaining.",
            "If I had to use just one word to describe Nurse Betty, that word would undoubtedly be...Quirky. And I mean that in a really, really good way.",
            "In the end [it] tells us we shouldn't depend on each other... we should be glad that 'we have ourselves.' What a lonely and sad conclusion.",
            "Nurse Betty suffers, however, from a script that relies on jaded hit men for comic impact. We've seen it done too many times since...Pulp Fiction.",

            "A strong contender for one of the best films of the year.",
            "This bizarrely funny satire/allegory from the maker of heavier fare such as In the Company of Men works on a surprising number of levels, not the least of which is perhaps the first human Renee Zellweger performance I have ever seen.",
            "With Nurse Betty, Zellweger moves fully into the realm of leading lady. Her crooked mouth and mousey voice notwithstanding, I wouldn't think it would be out of the question for her to garner an Oscar nomination for this excellent performance...",
            "While Nurse Betty proves that LaBute has more than one string to his bow, you can't help thinking that he makes more memorable cinema when revelling in misanthropy.",
            "A highly unlikely blend of savage violence, farcical humor and impossible romantic yearning, acted out with sometimes awe-inspiring precision.",

            "Does its spoofing with a blunt instrument instead of a scalpel, and it's engineered to appeal to the lowest instincts of its targeted adolescent audiences.",

            "Transparently misogynist at its core.",

            "Mal\u00e8na barely speaks a word in the film, but Belucci makes a role that is written as a symbol into a full-blooded person.",
            "For those of us who love Cinema Paradiso, the news that its Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore and his musical soulmate Ennio Morricone were getting back together to do another coming-of-age film, Malena, gave us tantalizing hope. Malena fa",
            "Tornatore's Malena is to adolescence what his Cinema Paradiso was to childhood, a lyrical if sentimental fable about the perils of gowing up and the power of the imagination.",

            "Basinger's performance is exceptional. She brings a raw, unselfconscious drive to the role that holds the film together, even while Hudson keeps it hopscotching across time.",
            "Kim Basinger, as Kuki, is attractive and touching, but she's given one unplayable scene after another.",
            "I Dreamed of Africa fails on so many levels that it's hard to even give it credit for the one area in which it excels.",
            "It's very similar in story and theme to Out Of Africa but lacks that film's grandeur and real sense of what makes the heroine love the country.",

            "Director Hugh Hudson gives us a Kenya that is dusty, bleak and generally unappealing. Rarely has a movie about Africa aroused so few feelings of escapism.",

            "I Dreamed of Africa is, quite simply, one of the worst mainstream movies ever made.",

            "McQuarrie's script has some wonderfully ripe gangster dialogue, and as you'd expect, the characters and situations are never quite who and what they seem. But the payoff is blunted by the preposterous -- and unnecessarily gory -- shootouts.",
            "Like a director who's budgeted a helicopter and can't bear not to use it, McQuarrie can't help larding his directorial debut with trimmings from far superior crime dramas, old and new.",
            "What aims at being terrifying is just loud and goofy.",
            "We can still smirk at the flashy mechanics of \"The Usual Suspects\" and justly so. But \"The Way of the Gun\" leaves us a little more stone-faced and somber, contemplating all we've denied ourselves because we feel somehow incapable or unworthy.",
            "Outrageous, unrelenting and blood-soaked.",
            "The new director's pacing runs slack sometimes and never quite achieves the quality of taut suspense, but there is so much promise and the script is so much better than most that it's a pleasure to watch. ",
            "Packaged with solid acting, an edgy western setting, and a complex yet intriguing weave of stories, this movie ends up being pretty entertaining.",
            "A grisly mix of carnage, torture, backroom surgery and painful dialogue.",
            "Before it fires off a few too many volleys of bullets for its own good, The Way of the Gun rolls out as a noirish, contemporary crime drama with a cool, retro-Western air.",
            "Far more troubling than technical deficiencies is the cynicism of The Way of the Gun, which trots out the cliches of gratuitous violence and nihilism without considering them in a fresh or critical way.",
            "Devoid of even one sympathetic character, sluggishly paced, and full of unnecessary subplots and supporting players, The Way Of The Gun is bad enough to suggest that, three films into his career, McQuarrie's best moments are already behind him.",
            "Anyone expecting the devious subtlety of Suspects will be hugely disappointed by this.",
            "It is evil because secretly it does not know what it is. It is evil because it is adrift in a world that is too opiated to confront its soulless convictions. It is evil because it comes from a place that has confused the fantastical and the realistic.",

            "The plot is almost as convoluted as the story in The Usual Suspects, but McQuarrie substitutes revolting buckets of blood for the style and wit of the earlier movie.",
            "Exceptionally violent movie -- not for kids.",
            "It boastfully claims roaring, bloodletting gunfire to do Sam Peckinpah proud, Joe Kraemer's throbbing percussive score (proving timpani should get more melodies) and any number of quotable, slick dialogue snippets. Swaggering, verbose, soulful and badass.",
            "This bullet-riddled domino effect of surprise complications, deception, duplicitous relationships, and mayhem is vintage Peckinpah and Tarantino minus the compelling characters.",
            "A lethargically paced yarn that overextends its welcome by at least 25 minutes.",
            "It's a tour-de-force of cinematic invention. But at the same time, it's just about the coldest, most pointless crime movie I've ever seen."

            "Small and subdued, yet at the same time epic in scale. Shyamalan tells the story of superheroes, but in a contained and human fashion. ",
            "I was never really bored and it's a pretty creative twist on the comic book genre. Unfortunately I appreciate it more for the potential than the end result.",
            "I refuse to call this masterpiece a superhero film because I cannot compare it formula based films that work under big studio standards. [Full review in Spanish].",

            "Interesting premise, but ultimately disappointing.",

            "A superhero origin story for an audience that appreciates human stories...",

            "Gem of a movie.",
            "...what I especially loved was that this film lets its two main characters do genuinely awful, hurtful things, which don't even disrupt the siblings' mirrored self-righteousness...",
            "The kind of film that often gets lost in the Hollywood shuffle, You Can Count On Me is marked by great writing... and utterly believable relationships between characters.",
            "Unusually sharp editing is the first hint that in fact it's a superior, acutely observed comedy-drama about family ties and the struggle to find a sense of purpose, even managing to work in some genuinely metaphysical intimations.",

            "A score of Bach's unaccompanied cello suites befits siblings accustomed to solitude - passages of mourning and joy given life by characters with proper proportions of antagonism and affection. Unresolved yet complete, it's about replacing fear with truth.",
            "The lead characters are extremely well played by Laura Linney and Mark Ruffalo. Yet above all it is Kenneth Lonergan's writing and direction that left the biggest mark.",
            "Stylized showmen do Rain Man and Forrest Gump, but it takes a natural actor like Ruffalo to pull off this strange beauty.",
            "Linney and Ruffalo's rapport is warm but raw and unsentimental, capturing the unconditional tough love dynamic that can only exist between siblings.",
            "A quiet, amazingly sharp character study.",
            "Lonergan avoids the faults of many American storytellers by refusing to cast characters in a judgmental light, giving each enough dignity to be convincing and sympathetic.",
            "It is a rarity to find a film willing to tell a story through an exploration of the relationship, the romance, between a brother and a sister."

            "A very curious and eclectic piece of work.",
            "The tone of wistful regret and longing doesn't preclude a good deal of gentle humour. It's a restrained, subtly suggestive piece which disintegrates if you try to get a fix on it.",
            "A disarmingly poetic - and specifically female - vision of adolescence that it belongs in a category of its own.",
            "Coppola's direction engagingly avoids the coming-of-age cliches and the film boasts an excellent performance from Kirsten Dunst.",
            "Sofia Coppola's directorial debut is a dark, gauzy adaptation...The laconic style of the film purposefully and poetically echoes the emotionally troubled tide that grips the sisters.",
            "By the end, The Virgin Suicides is a rare thing, an anti-coming-of-age movie.",
            "A uniquely unforgettable movie experience.",
            "The Virgin Suicides offers a glimpse into the murky unknowability of adolescence, and its legacy is tied to the portraits of femininity with which Sofia Coppola has crafted her filmography. ",
            "A brilliant external commentary on patriarchy, affluence and homogeneity, as well as an experiential ode to the intangibles and inherent mysteries of the human condition.",
            "Intense, imperfect movie about teen suicide.",
            "Sofia Coppola's compelling, ethereal fable about adolescent loss of innocence is claustrophobic and uncomfortable, but profoundly affecting and gently funny. \"The Virgin Suicides\" advises teen years are sometimes best remembered as a long-ago vacation.",
            "Sofia Coppola's adaptation of Jeffery Eugenides' 1993 novel plays like a sweet, sad dream.",
            "It's yet another case of blame-the-parents, and, more precisely, blame-the-overprotective-mother.",
            "An assured feature debut, this darkly humorous exploration of a tough subject benefits from an original narrative and the fact that the appealing cast consists of actors who are the same age as the characters they play.",
            "The strongest directorial debut of the year.",
            "A rather stunted and sliggish exercise in style whose sporadically haunting visual quality doesn't make up for its shallowness and ponderous pace.",
            "A stellar debut feature from Sofia Coppola and it's a must see.",
            "Concentration on either the writing or the direction, but not both, may have spawned a better film from first-timer Sofia C.",
            "Mergulhando com sensibilidade na amargura do universo adolescente, com seus anseios e frustra\u00e7\u00f5es, Coppola estr\u00e9ia de forma memor\u00e1vel na dire\u00e7\u00e3o.",
            "Black comedy has never looked so good.",
            "If missteps hold the film back from achieving the full grandeur it aims for, there is no denying the way it conjures a magic-realist American suburbia, rarely before brought so convincingly to life.",
            "If [Coppola's] debut film is any indication, talent does run in the family -- even if it is a somewhat disjointed talent."

            "it's original, sharply funny, and rather moving",

            "The film is a rare oddity in that is very much of its period, yet is absolutely timeless. It's not just that the poetry Jarmusch pulls from Hagakure ... it's that the film constantly creates a simultaneous sense of something ending and beginning.",
            "You don't have to \"get\" Ghost Dog to enjoy it; it's an experience more open to interpretation.",
            "Even when aware of all the strange, disparate elements, it still surprises.",
            "Jarmusch's original film, which deconstructs the mobster genre as seen through the eyes of a Samurai, is by turn eccentric, mysterious, and mythical, defying viewers expectations",
            "One of the coolest movies to come down the pike in years.",
            "Jarmusch blends these disparate themes into a cohesive film that combines humor and truly unique characters with Eastern philosophy, mobster flick and shoot-'em-up western.",
            "Visually creative film with a remarkable use of color and music.",
            "I can scarcely think of ways to improve this engrossing, original, near-brilliant production.",
            "Ghost Dog himself is so remote and focused on his path, it's hard to drum up a lot of identification or sympathy.",
            "An act of pure, unadulterated creativity that boasts its narrative gambles and poetic whimsy as badges of honor... One of the most improbably gorgeous films of the year.",
            "Jarmusch and Whitaker are masters at work proving once again that you don't need a huge budget to tell a meaningful story.",

            "...I was lulled by the relaxed storytelling.",

            "Most of the time Chicken Run entertains, instructs, involves and enchants.",
            "Run to Chicken Run. This clay-animation comedy is the most entertaining animal story since Babe.",
            "So great.",
            "It's a warm-hearted and amusing entertainment that your children will enjoy.",
            "Chickens are inherently funny, like nature's idea of a very practical joke. Park and Lord have just improved the old rubber chicken gag, making it movable, turning it into something closer to who we are and what we know as humans.",
            "What gives this movie its oddly strong grip on a viewer's heart is a physical tenderness inseparable from the nature of claymation.",
            "The claymation comedy Chicken Run is eggsactly what the doctor ordered. It's a witty, high-spirited adventure that will appeal to moviegoers of all ages. Call it chicken soup for the funny bone. ",
            "The first feature film from England's Aardman Animation, and the first truly terrific film to be released by DreamWorks.",
            "The film is brilliantly voiced across the board, with special notice to Mel Gibson as Rocky and Julia Sawalha as Ginger.",
            "The sly, sardonic flight of fancy known as Chicken Run is a delightful epic of fowl deeds, quests for freedom and poultry heroics from the off-kilter English cartoon house, Aardman Animation.",
            "Like Wallace & Gromit, it's a paean to British eccentricity, equal parts cluelessness and hopefulness, full of English slang and dry Brit humor.",
            "Indeed, it's the best movie comedy to come out of England since Monty Python packed up the circus.",
            "Chicken Run contains some gorgeous, destined-to-be-classic set pieces, and this is where the Aardman production team flex their animation muscles.",
            "It's nothing less than a stop-motion tour de force, bursting with charm, humor, invention and eye-popping mise en scene.",
            "With its winking homages to films like Stalag 17 and The Great Escape, Run is visually inventive, its characters plump with personality and, for a bunch of chickens, ever so brave.",
            "This wonderful visual treat is done in stop-action clay animation, a form which is both substantial and magical. It's as if the clay figures kids make have managed to take on a life of their own.",
            "This first feature by Nick Park and Peter Lord, the team that brought you Wallace and Gromit, is a diabolically witty piece of work, a haymaker.",
            "Most of the laughs stem from the peculiar appeal of claymation -- something about a raised eyebrow or other subtle bit of expression just seems funnier at the stop-motion speed of claymation.",
            "Apart from looking like no other type of animated film, Chicken Run stands alone in its unwavering determination not to play down to the kiddies.",
            "Chicken Run isn't just chock-full of references to classic prison-break movies and some witty inside Hollywood jokes, but is filled with a secret ingredient sadly missing from its super-digitized, merchandise-driven counterparts: heart."

            "What makes But I'm A Cheerleader so emotionally affecting is that despite the cotton-candy exterior, the film never lets its audience forget that these are people undergoing a traumatic experience.",
            "Director Jamie Babbit and screenwriter Brian Wayne Peterson haven't attacked their target as effectively as they might, but as mild as it may be, Cheerleader underscores the fact that gender roles are ideological in nature.",

            "This is basically sloppy, all-over-the-map filmmaking with few hints of self-criticism and few genuine laughs.",
            "If Mr. Lee meant to bring back blackface entertainment as a metaphor for the current black performers he finds obnoxious, he has miscalculated.",

            "The initial shock of Bamboozled's blackface revival gives way to melancholic revelation, conjured from the history of cinema.",
            "As Nicolas Roeg wrote in his 2013 memoir The World is Ever Changing, \"You should make films for the future -- if you do that, the audience will catch up with you, eventually.\" Lee made a film which touches on the past, present and future.",
            " It works overtime to throw the audience off balance, to alienate us in almost Brechtian fashion, holding us at arm's length but demanding our attention as if saying \"don't look away, you need to see this.\"",
            "Audacious, vibrant, unsurprisingly maligned but frequently brilliant.",
            "Believe it or not, Bamboozled is a comedy, even if a dark one. Lee makes sure that there are plenty of laughs, even if he's poking the audience at the same time to wonder why they are laughing. ",
            "Bamboozled is both outrageous and outraged, with some bitter laughs strewn throughout. But the final act is ugly and unconvincing.",
            "It may not be very subtle but it is very funny, confrontational and thought-provoking throughout. ",
            "Bamboozled does more to really hit audiences in the face with challenging messages, and a specific look that certainly seems untraditional.",
            "Provocative Spike Lee movie for older teens.",
            "Lee, in his least commercial film, shoots for controversy but loses focus.",
            "Spike Lee's shotgun attack on the treatment of blacks in television and the blurring of image and identity is a brilliant rant that digresses into repetitive sermonizing.",
            "A particularly painful mess, because it begins so well and has such promise.",
            "...where most of us in his audience will lean forward to hear a whisper, we turn away from a shout. Oh, how Bamboozled shouts.",
            "The director's new masterpiece is a summation of nearly everything he has learned as a filmmaker, and about black culture, but he doesn't feel the need to beat the audience over the head for each lesson he's trying to impart.",
            "a sharp-edged, if somewhat heavy-handed, satire about popular culture and the portrayals of blacks in the mass media",
            "He hammers his point home until the viewer is emotionally beaten into submission and manipulated into a consenting stance.",
            "Spike Lee has made one of the few films in the year 2000 that is actually about something, and for that he deserves great credit.",
            "Extremely heavy-handed satire from director Spike Lee -- disturbing and thought-provoking but ultimately lacking a sense of focus."

            "It is monumental movie-making: visually thrilling, technically astonishing, and emotionally engaging.",
            "Throughout it all, Crowe maintains a tough, slot-mouthed reticence; he is very persuasive as the superman of the Colosseum.",

            "Ridley Scott thrusts us so close to the combat that all we see is a lot of whirling and thrashing, a sword thrust here and there, a spurt of blood, a limb severed. There's hardly a scene that is cleanly and coherently staged in open space.",
            "If there's a soft spot in your heart for the sword-&-sandal epic, then you'll swoon with giddy delight over Gladiator.",

            "Gladiator is timeless popular cinema - an event, an experience, and above all else, an epic not to be forgotten. ",
            "It wields its religiosity, and its democratic morality, with the subtlety of a broadsword. But this is a ferociously entertaining spectacle, with thrilling action sequences, eye-popping art direction and uniformly powerful performances.",
            "Ridley Scott takes an age-old formula and utilises it remarkably well, enhancing but never over-doing it with digital effects that help raise the ruins of the Colosseum and capture the magnificence and casual brutality of the culture.",
            "Gladiator certainly feels like it was written by committee and template.",
            "The film presents itself as worthy, but it's ultimately boring. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "By returning to basics, Ridley Scott's Gladiator deploys the oft-transposed genre in the way it was originally intended.",
            "Russell Crowe as Maximus has the charismatic glower of a true star.",
            "A movie initially intended as summer popcorn, but which somehow scored a Best Picture Oscar: the only one of Scott's lengthy and impressive canon to have done so.",
            "It took \"Alien\" director Ridley Scott to reinvigorate, however briefly, the sword and sandal genre at the turn of the 21st century. ",
            "The journey of Maximus, from triumph on the battlefield through despair and degradation in slavery and then to a final epiphany in the Colosseum is an exciting one - and Russell Crowe plays the character with considerable toughness and authority.",
            "Gladiator has the distinction of being both timely and nostalgic.",
            "This may be fundamentally Saturday night entertainment, but Scott attempts rather more than that on occasion, and at least succeeds in creating a memorable sense of a dark and often frightening period of time.",
            "Crowe is perfect for the role, creating a character that will quickly gain your sympathies.",
            "Gladiator is a remarkable spectacle of unforgivable length.",
            "Despite its big battle scenes and epic craftsmanship, Ridley Scott's Gladiator lacks the spirit and the true heart of a legendary epic; revisit Spartacus and Ben Hur on video for the real McCoy."

            "How \"The Yards\" shifts toward crime drama through character rather than pure plot is hard to disclose without divesting twists. Inspired by real-life scandal, James Gray lets personal insight color Shakespearean shenanigans of privilege, panic and power.",
            "Sem medo de evocar compara\u00e7\u00f5es com \"O Poderoso Chef\u00e3o\", Gray cria um filme repleto de personagens amb\u00edguos e uma forte atmosfera de tristeza e desesperan\u00e7a moral.",

            "Moving and memorable.",
            "The lives of these people inside their shacks are full of surprises as well as grim confirmations, but the things we don't know about them also significantly shape our experience of the film.",
            "Singer deserves credit for attempting to put a human face on such tragic circumstances, but he appears to have gotten so close to his main subjects that he seems unwilling to make them, or their desperate situation, look too bad.",
            "Some of these hardy souls have lived this way for years, decades even, and they've lived not just to tell the tale but to suggest that they've created a viable alternative existence. At times, Dark Days almost makes you envious. But only almost.",
            "Revealing, if occasionally frustrating.",
            "Dark Days is an unimaginable story, skillfully documented by a passionate film making novice, and wonderfully scored by the high-profile DJ Shadow.",
            "The documentary is amazing.",
            "The virtue of Dark Days is that it provides a forum for its subjects, who turn out to be funny, charming, acerbic, annoying, callous, kind and, ultimately, fully human. The movie's other quality -- a dewy romanticism -- is both an asset and a detriment.",
            "Marc Singer's documentary Dark Days absolutely blew me away. It takes the viewer on a thoroughly engrossing journey to the heart of darkness.",
            "Singer's grainy... photography lends the film the evocative aura of something that has been unearthed, while the spare, haunting soundtrack by DJ Shadow perfectly captures the sense of otherworldliness that pervades this remarkable film.",
            "As we come to know the residents, we find their lives, and yearning for home and safety, as tragic, funny, and involving as anything in a scripted movie.",
            "A fascinating, beautifully photographed portrait of a vanished community: a group of homeless people who built a shanty town in the train tunnels beneath Penn Station.",
            "Singer's stark black-and-white photography renders their world with the abstract horror of a German expressionist film, yet he's equally skilled at coaxing the grim personal stories of life underground.",
            "It's hard not to get caught up in these people's lives, or to be impressed by their resiliency.",
            "Singer captures intimate moments in the lives of his subterranean protagonists in their strange, crepuscular world.",
            "A portrait of the homeless community of \"mole people\" who lived in sections of disused underground tunnels in New York, this is a singularly powerful account of the lives of the dispossessed and desperate.",
            "Designed neither to warm your heart nor shelter you in the comfort of liberal guilt, the movie does what so many style-conscious, \"subjective\" documentaries have long forgotten how to do. It shows you a world, and stays the hell out of it.",
            "Singer achieves remarkable intimacy with his subjects, who share their experiences and joke around with the man behind the camera as freely as they do with their peers.",
            "Simultaneously uplifting and shaming.",
            "Marc Singer's camera hustles and chills along with them all, documenting their lives in black-and-white as high-contrast as the days above to the nights below.",
            "The ending is pat but the characters' tragic stories linger on, squatting in the darker corners of your mind.",
            "A black-and-white hymn to the energy of the dispossessed, made in the late 1990s, but still horribly relevant.",
            "I would love to see a kind of 14-Up sequel: what's happened to these people in the interim? A tough, compassionate movie."

            "This is a nervy, risky film, and Villeneuve has inspired Croze to give herself over completely to the tormented persona of Bibi.",
            "Maelstrom is strange and compelling, engrossing and different, a moral tale with a twisted sense of humor.",
            "Sensual, funny and, in the end, very touching.",
            "Directed with astonishing flair by Denis Villeneuve, and powered by a charismatic performance from Marie-Jos\u00e9e Croze, this is an art film that is more bracing than most, surfing themes of guilt and despair without getting dragged down by the undertow.",
            "Birth and death are connected in 'Maelstr\u00f6m', in which Villeneuve does not execute any kind of judgment on Bibiane's alleged lack of morality. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "Antiseptic and distantly intellectual.",
            "Not too far below the gloss you can still feel director Denis Villeneuve's beating heart and the fondness he has for his characters.",
            "Most fish stories are a little peculiar, but this is one that should be thrown back in the river.",
            "An oddity, to be sure, but one that you might wind up remembering with a degree of affection rather than revulsion.",
            "An oddly affecting and often darkly funny drama about the randomness of life and the possibility of redemption.",
            "The main story ... is compelling enough, but it's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish.",
            "'Sophisticated' viewers who refuse to admit that they don't like it will likely call it 'challenging' to their fellow sophisticates.",
            "Offers the flash of rock videos fused with solid performances and eerie atmosphere.",
            "Observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout Maelstrom.",
            "[Villeneuve] seems to realize intuitively that even morality is reduced to an option by the ultimate mysteries of life and death.",
            "I'll put it this way: If you're in the mood for a melodrama narrated by talking fish, this is the movie for you.",
            "Villeneuve spends too much time wallowing in Bibi's generic angst (there are a lot of shots of her gazing out windows).",
            "The overall story is one of intriguing insight and emotion, well-acted by the cast and ambitiously directed by Villeneuve."

            "While this cautionary tale of brotherhood gone wrong doesn't exactly break new ground, it certainly shows off its writer-director-star's triple-threat filmmaking potency.",

            "Would easily qualify for an Oscar nomination if it were in a movie that was a bit less like canned theater and more cinematic.",
            "It reeks of staged theater: three men in one room talking endlessly.",
            "The pingpong repetition of dialogue is more precious than poetic and heavy silences and actorly asides draw out a slim story that packs few dramatic surprises.",
            "Never loses its identity as a work meant strictly for the stage.",
            "Despite some pacing missteps, this well-acted and colorfully photographed film is a gripping, gritty look at a hard-knock Life.",
            "Enough expertise has been lavished on this small film to make one almost forget that Once in the Life has been done more than once before.",
            "The good news is that Fishburne also stars, and has recruited a talented group of actors to flesh out the cast; the bad news is that no one seems to have been on hand to help out with the rest of film.",
            "While the line-readings are often dead-on, Fishburne's movie suffers from the usual one-room claustrophobia and Mametian repetitions.",
            "Strictly for die-hard Fishburne fans, and even they might be getting awfully fidgety by the end.",
            "Serves only to demonstrate that Fishburne, a talented, inventive actor, is, unfortunately, not ready to write and direct motion pictures.",
            "Despite numerous cutaways to juice things up, a movie that once moved becomes static and verbal in the stretch.",
            "The script bogs itself down in reminiscing passages that steal Life's soul.",
            "Not embarrassing, just not all that interesting, either.",
            "In opening up his play for a filmed version, Once in the Life, Fishburne may have only succeeded in magnifying the flaws of his original.",
            "A hit-and-miss effort.",
            "Needlessly convoluted storytelling, talkiness and misplaced narrative emphasis.",
            "Without a coherent story to hold our attention, the mood of somber, lower-depths desperation soon becomes monotonous."

            "The Coens are like party acquaintances who keep changing the subject and then staring at you quizzically when you can't follow the thread, or when you stop wanting to follow it, but who then block all your exit routes from their obnoxious conversation.",
            "The ferociously one-dimensional characters here make this muddy ramble more of a guilty pleasure than a success.",

            "Astutely observed, subtly played and consistently hilarious...",
            "When the script puts its faith in the audience, allowing us to find the laughs on our own, the film is irresistible, a bright lark. Yet when the writers panic, upping the antic volume and shifting into crazed sitcom gear, the lark stops.",
            "A hilarious hodgepodge of The In-Laws and Annie Hall, in which De Niro gives his best comic performance to date.",
            "Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller seem evenly matched, making effective foils.",
            "Star-driven comedy at times offensive and funny.",

            "Owes about 55 percent of its charm to De Niro, who can be hilarious just sitting there.",
            "Director Jay Roach of the Austin Powers films keeps the pace brisk, and the script by Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg ably piles the pratfalls ludicrously high.",
            "Stiller portrays a human accident better than anyone and he definitely knows how to extort laughs and sympathy from his audience",
            "Contains enough belly-laughs and sly jokes to become one of the bigger crowd-pleasers of the fall.",
            "Never before have two such skilled actors been so monstrously squandered in a movie so replete with failed gags and pathetic gaffes.",

            "An entertaining little outing, but not something that will stay with me.",
            "The best American comedy of 2000. It has wit, slapstick and romance -- as well as an improbable comedy team in Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller",
            "Does the usual Hollywood bit of setting up the gags way in advance so that even a coma patient can spot them.",
            "As far as one-joke movies go, this one has its guffaws.",

            "Even today, this euphoric road trip perfectly captures the self-destruction of touring musicians in the 1970s. Music isn't about cocaine and long hair, free love and road trips... it's about a feeling.",

            "For every scene that's a sturdy piece of observed wisdom about coming of age... there's another that's pure cheese.",
            "The film itself -- a quasi-autobiography of writer-director Cameron Crowe -- is still good, but not as good as it seemed 14 years ago. ",
            "will satisfy many music fans for its honest portrayal of the rock-band life",
            "...funny, joyous, touching, and moving...a very personal film and a most-universal one combined.",
            "Great, but lots of sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll.",
            "Director Cameron Crowe won the Original Screenplay Oscar for his warmly nostalgic, often sharply observed memoir of his early days as a music journalist",
            "Whether disappointed or elated, Cameron Crowe's observations are trenchant. Instinct is the greatest asset as idols let you down. That first gulp of passion in a profession can quench you for years. Quite often, bassists and drummers have little to say.",
            "It's a world of brotherhood, groupies, the bright spotlight of fame, and the bitterness of business, packaged into a gushing, intuitive valentine from Crowe to his former magical life.",
            "Cameron Crowe has a knack for making contagious movies that pull audiences into a whirlpool of situations that make you feel impossibly cool because his characters aren't near as cool as their surroundings imply.",
            "A great love letter to classic rock...",
            "Easily the best film on Crowe's already impressive roster.",

            "Exciting mainly because anything can happen and does, the movie drags a bit as it approaches a climax set on top of the Statue of Liberty. But once there it revives.",
            "This is a film that should satisfy fans of the hugely popular comic book and audiences who can't tell one uncanny X-Man from another. Mutants rule.",
            "The script could be a lot snappier, particularly during some virtually unexplained rivalry banter between Marsden and Jackman, but X-Men is a decent start to what will no doubt be an immensely profitable series of negligible but enjoyable summer movies.",
            "The most beautiful, strange, and exciting comic-book movie since the original Batman.",
            "X-Men, it must be said, has only a few truly thrilling moments. This is not a picture that tries to blow you out of your seat. But more than any other big movie this summer, it has a consistently inventive vision.",
            "Ultimately, the story serves as a parable for intolerance, xenophobia, and us-versus-them mentalities - themes that are perpetually relevant and potent.",
            "X-Men plays faithful to the comics while opening the doors to a larger universe to come.",
            "The film gains a lot from the grandiose theatrical casting of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen in the two main roles, but the rest of the film is far too patchy and hammy.",
            "Indeed, even Hugh Jackman was not cast in this role for his neon-lit global fame among the youth... although he earns a place in the starry firmament of cinema with this well judged performance.",
            "What makes X-men an enjoyable film is the really fine work from many of the actors.",
            "It's good, damn good. ",
            "What is most surprising and wonderful about director Bryan Singer's X-Men is how skillfully it avoids all of the myriad potholes placed in its path.",

            "When the big battle between Magneto and Xavier's forces gets going, you have lightning bolts, steel claws, magnetic fields, explosive red rays and flyaway tongues. It's a variety show, and all the acts have rushed onstage at once.",
            "The Marvel Comics characters are well realised, and Singer mixes the classic values of good storytelling with liberal amounts of digital magic. On the down side, this plays a little too much like the beginning of a franchise.",
            "In Singer's dark vision, action and special effects take a back seat to message. He uses X-Men to preach a sermon of tolerance; like most sermons, it isn't much fun to sit through. X misses the spot.",
            "X-Men is a terrific piece of summer entertainment that's going to heat up the box office like a mutant's eye beams.",
            "The movie is respectful of its source material without being the least bit self-important. X-Men may have hit the Platonic ideal of comic-book movies, coming across as lightweight, sophisticated, wacky and straightforward all at the same time.",
            "The action in this case is fitful, the acting semaphoric, the narrative movement clunky and the plot ultimately self-canceling.",
            "The deft way that Singer and company have transferred the action comics to the big screen reps one of the best efforts since Superman II.",
            "These are superheroes who largely regret their powers because of the trouble that they bring.",
            " Of course, the wide-open ending practically shrieks \"sequel,\" so rest assured this is only the beginning of a new super-franchise. Here's hoping Joel Schumacher doesn't get his hands on it."
