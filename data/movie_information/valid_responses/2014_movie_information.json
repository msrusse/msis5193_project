            "It barely matters whether this movie is good or bad. Bay is now the sort of filmmaker -- the only one, perhaps -- whose moviemaking goes beyond such binary banality.",
            "For the better part of the film's 165-minute running time we get Crash. Bang. Crash. Bang. Bludgeon. Crash. Bang. Bludgeon. Bang. Crash.",
            "You would think that after three films, Bay would find some groove with this material. If anything, he's regressed. ",

            "I'm not sure if that even qualifies it as a film as I understand the definition. It's actually little more than feature-length commercial.",
            "Too many minutes, too many characters, not enough story. The VFX, however, are a triumph. ",
            "Because the screen is now so incredibly saturated with CGI, we simply don't believe for a single second that anything that happens in front of us is anything other than millions of engineered pixels jostling together for our ill-deserved attention.",
            "The script, written by Ehren Kruger, contains neither coherent narrative nor character development, and the dialogue is laughable for all the wrong reasons.",
            "Rather than focusing on the meat of the film, re: the ginormous robots that are awesome, the film spends an absurdly long time setting up its character development for the humans.",
            "That ship sailed four movies ago, but somewhere inside Age of Extinction, there exists the schlocky promise of that kind of entertainment. So frustrating then, to have to sit through all the rest of it.",
            "Transformers: Age of Extinction has a lot of good stuff. It's just that, in order to get to it, you have to sit through the rest of a movie that could have been made much tighter without sacrificing quality or coherence. ",
            "It's so monotonous and dull that it makes Dark of the Moon look like a breezy 90-minute romp. ",
            "When it came time to take in the series' fourth installment...the (very) low bar I'd set for myself was that it not put me to sleep. Well, it didn't",
            "T4 will no doubt be one of the biggest films of the summer and it's not worth five cents in creativity, authenticity, humanity or depth. At least these films are expensive so they don't come out too often.",
            "It's dull, horrifying and miserable.",
            "Based on approximately 615 minutes worth of evidence, the series probably won't get much better than Age of Extinction, which is less a recommendation than a statement of resignation.",
            "This movie is so long, it is ridiculous. I literally rationed out my popcorn. ",
            "If it wasn't for a mess of a third act, Age of Extinction might have been a half-decent movie."

            "After the first hour, with its poignant depiction of humanity's decline, Interstellar always seems to be rebuilding its momentum, offering plenty to think about but little to hold on to.",
            " It's a film I didn't exactly enjoy and can't say I would recommend. And yet as an event, as a singular movie-watching opportunity, it's undoubtedly worthwhile.",
            "Interstellar may be a preposterous epic, but it is an epic nonetheless. ",
            "...an often insanely ambitious science fiction epic that that remains mesmerizing for most of its (admittedly overlong) running time...",
            "Scientists will debate, theologians will contemplate, philosophers will wonder, and cinema lovers will bask in the glory of another remarkable Christopher Nolan achievement. ",
            " A big-budget reprise of ideas Nolan has been exploring since the beginning of his career. Not only is it a film about the passage of time, it's also a film about memory. ",
            "None of these characters feel fully-fledged... for a film so rife with schmaltzy musings on the meaning of life, it's alarming how lacking it is in this department.",
            "Interstellar is not Christopher Nolan's best film but what I will say is that you can't deny his ambition.",
            "As spectacular as it is flawed.",
            "Interstellar is not only a grand space adventure worthy of the big screen, it's also a powerfully emotional story about the bond between a father and daughter, and how that love can drive one to attempt the impossible.",
            "One of the boldest science-fiction movies I've ever seen, both in narrative and visual terms. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "It was a blockbuster movie-going experience.",
            "I guess the take away is all you need is love... and morse code?",
            "Interstellar is, all in all, a very fine science fiction film. ",
            "Interstellar is 120 minutes of good movie stuffed into 170 minutes.",
            "Interstellar is Nolan at his most humane. It's a good look for him.",
            "Overall, Interstellar looks nice but ultimately lacks substance. Nolan essentially loses his way by going to space.",
            "The space voyage is easily one of Nolan's most thought-provoking films yet. It's definitely his most ambitious.",
            "As far as a masterful visualization of space and an exploration of profound theory, it belongs on a shortlist of must see films which it's comparably akin to... But Nolan's film falls short in other realms, namely the human component.",
            "It's as grand as it is introspective and as grounded as it is existential. By the end of the nearly three-hour running time - it goes by in a flash - you feel as if you've experienced something that is so rarely captured on film. ",
            "Christopher Nolan more than deserves however much money the studios are willing to keep giving him to make these brainy beautiful blockbusters."

            "While everything about Boyhood is done with extraordinary care, the master stroke was clearly the casting, 13 years ago, of a little Texas boy named Ellar Coltrane.",
            "It's like a time-lapse photo of an expanding consciousness.",
            "Cinema has always been the best place for time travel, but rarely has it been so anchored in reality than in Richard Linklater's Boyhood.",
            "It is most certainly a rarity when ambition is met by remarkable achievement.",
            "The simplicity of story in Linklater's Boyhood, following the not-overly eventful life of six-year-old Mason till he leaves home for college as a teen, is an incredible cinematic achievement. ",

            "It seems like a lot of satirical hue and cry about a social problem I'm not sure the nation is currently plagued by. Are local TV news stations really conducting daily bidding wars over the goriest footage random freelancers can bring them?",

            "Just as we think things will snap into reality, Gilroy delves deeper into the surreal - working the satire with light taps to start, and ending with the thud of a hammer.",
            "It skilfully juggles a character with no redeeming features through his obsession with his work and thrusts him into a world where the lines between right and wrong are always questioned and debated.",

            "Gyllenhaal's Lou Bloom may not have visible fangs, but he'd give any movie monster an authentic run for their money.",
            "Nightcrawler is an audacious mainstream thriller, a bombastic character study and a hell of a first movie for Gilroy, even if it's a little terrifying to think of what characters he will dream up next.",
            "Gyllenhaal is Nightcrawler's battery; his creation, cooked from the greasy rinds of Jordan Belfort et al., saturates every frame with a queasy intensity.",

            "It is a smart, visually dynamic film, but audiences may miss Spielberg's wonderment.",
            "This kind of magpie filmmaking can work with a sincere core, but the big problem is that Earth to Echo lacks one. It's all spare parts.",
            "You can imagine ET phoning his legal team, but although this kids' sci-fi adventure is derivative, its characters are drawn with more care and insight than you'd expect. ",
            "If the movie is a waste, at least it's an instructive one, signaling just how offensive children's entertainment might become in the YouTube era.",

            "[I]f you want a moving account of kids coming-of-age with an SFF twist, you'd be better off just screening The Goonies or E.T. at home.",
            "There are so many, well, I'll be charitable and call them 'homages' to 80s movies that I stopped counting. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, except for the fact that once referenced, it was hard not to compare those movies to yours",
            "It's all well and good to say that the actors are relatively new to the field, but when the film rests entirely on their shoulders, it's simply not enough for their acting and camaraderie to be at best passable. ",
            "If you aren't concerned with the E.T. comparisons and are just looking for something to see at the theater with all the kids, \"Earth to Echo\" will do the job a lot better than most of today's nonanimated options.",
            "Earth to Echo will appeal to the nostalgia of older kids who appreciate a good coming-of-age romp, parents looking for movies that eschew most of the usual stereotypes of teens on film, and the average YouTuber and tween.",

            "Clich\u00e9d and predictable it may all be, there is no denying the infectious quality of pure optimism.",
            "Sad to say it is not even this generation's 'Short Circuit.' Families deserve much better entertainment at the movie theater, summer or otherwise.",
            "All in all, \"Earth to Echo\" is passable family entertainment, neither unforgettable nor particularly bad. ",
            "It has a good young cast, some occasionally dazzling special effects and a message that even when growing friends grow move apart it's not the end of their own little world.",
            "Earth to Echo won't wallop young viewers, but I wouldn't be surprised if kids who catch this at the right age are utterly captivated.",
            "A Spielbergian adventure flick targeted at tweens who tweet, this is an intermittently interesting tale about three kids who, mainly, discover that technology is even more really, really awesome and cool than any of us earthlings ever thought.",

            "As a whole it's a headache-inducing ordeal which might, hopefully, put an end to 'found footage' as a sub-genre."

            "Somewhere in its two hours, This Is Where I Leave You morphs into the well-considered, emotionally resonant fare that we should still expect from our multiplexes.",
            "It's enough to know that Jason Bateman, Tina Fey, Adam Driver, Connie Britton... bring warmth as well as a certain comic snappiness to the goings-on. Meaning, the movie is perfectly efficient - and likable - whether jerking tears or soliciting laughs.",
            "I wouldn't say I hated it but my dislike knew no bounds.",
            "Jason Bateman is very good at radiating gentle melancholy, and here plays a man with plenty to be blue about.",

            "The Altmans might be way ahead of the Osbournes and Kardashians in terms of letting their private moments hang out, but the movie is as profound as a reality show in its exploration of family dynamics."

            "The November Man is one of those thrillers that grows progressively more incoherent, and it simply isn't fast enough to glide over its gaping narrative holes.",

            "Though it starts off as a decently fun throwback to a kind of movie that doesn't get made much anymore, nostalgia only carries the film so far. ",
            "Director Roger Donaldson, reteaming with his 'Dante's Peak' star, [Pierce] Brosnan, excels at the interplay of espionage and red herrings, keeping us on our toes with plot points and twists and turns while dazzling with some well-timed action sequences.",
            "Like a semi-talented juggler that takes on one ball too many, Donaldson's film of furiously committed and concurrent clusters end up smashing into each other to concoct a rather silly and sallow end product. ",

            "The film falters most in its dual purposes: mentor/mentee cat and mouse versus international conspiracy leading to a puppet Russian president with a pension for under aged war refugees.",
            "The November Man is diverting and Brosnan's fans should be pleased; it just isn't the kind of engrossing, thoughtful drama that its elements suggest it intends to be. ",
            "By the half-way point in the film, the outcome already is determined, but you still have to remain in your seat, painfully watching as the characters catch up to what you already know.",
            "You'll have seen The November Man's espionage shenanigans done much better elsewhere, but Brosnan proves his spry spy veteran has still got what it takes while veteran director Roger Donaldson keeps the action nimble.",
            "The sometimes-cluttered plot aside, this slickly-shot film manages to pass muster. A big reason why you might want to see this film is because Pierce Brosnan is in it. And indeed, it is on his able shoulders that this movie rests.",
            "[The film] very deliberately trades on whatever nostalgia moviegoers might have left for Pierce Brosnan as a secret agent, and ticket-buyers' mileage will vary accordingly.",
            "A few brain cells short and a handful of years too late.",
            "The only purpose for its existence is potentially giving film students an interesting study in overcompensation.",

            " Promising start, but by the midway point the film devolves to a generic action film with themes you've seen countless times already.",
            "A welcome throwback spy thriller that is as old-fashioned as it is derivative, but gives Brosnan's fans a taste of the former 007 agent.",
            "The November Man is a second-rate espionage thriller that desperately wants to be in the same tier as Jason Bourne and Jack Ryan, but thanks to dull characters and an unengaging plot, it merely ends up being a flat and forgettable spy outing."

            "To call Sin City noir is to misunderstand the genre, as perhaps Miller does. Each story ends pretty simply-in brutal fighting and murder-and lacks genuine intrigue or ambiguity.",

            "Reviewers were forbidden from posting a word about this sequel until opening day, lest we give away the shocking secret that it's a carbon copy of its predecessor.",
            "There are a handful of ways in which A Dame to Kill For actually improves on the first movie. Alas, none are enough to prevent it from being a substantial disappointment.",
            "A Dame To Kill For isn't likely to create converts out of those uninterested in the pulpy side of fiction. But it more than earns its keep in terms of lavishing love, mildly ironic as well as pretty damn earnest, on pumped-up noir. ",
            "Miller's original comic-book frames serve narrative functions, but these movies are all grabby graphics, devoid of compelling style.",
            "Some of the supporting newcomers, I'm thinking of Dennis Haysbert and Jeremy Piven in particular, are welcome additions.",
            "Sin City is a dark, seedy, bloodily violent world that may not be the best place for everyone, but it's fun for those who belong there. You know who you are.",
            "The film retains the stunning visual style of its predecessor with some eye-catching shots, but its vision detracts substance from the driving elements of Frank Miller's world. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "If a script like this one is placed before these interpreters, one begins to understand the reason for the tedium that invades the entire movie, from start to finish. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Like the original, Sin City: A Dame To Kill For is episodic. But the 2005 installment's brutal short stories added up to a satisfying whole, while the sequel is an incoherent mess. ",
            "[A]ction-packed explosion of raw and visceral lust, corruption, vengeance and violence that dazzles, delights, intrigues, and celebrates the noir thrillers of the 30's, 40's and 50's on screen and on the pulp page.",
            "Much as she does in the 300 sequel that premiered earlier this year, Eva Green demonstrates what a powerful asset she can be in otherwise subpar material. ",
            "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is part entertaining cartoon noir, part violently fetishized relationship revenge fantasy. The first part is recommendable; the second part is vile.",
            "The actors clearly know how to fit into this graphic noir world, and are a great reason to see this quasi-sequel. ",
            "Despite the opportunities granted by previous installments, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For regrettably features less of the same - both in style and substance.",
            "Lacks the same sizzle as the original, making it a flat sequel that is all style and little substance.",
            "It often feels like the table scraps of the first film, which basically used up all the best material and that doesn't leave much for this follow-up to work with.",
            "Unfortunately the narrative changes, sluggish pacing and mind-blowing lack of established time keep the film from achieving the lofty goals the original [Sin City] attained.",
            "This latest onscreen venture is imperfect, but it still put a goofy grin on this grumpy critic's face. ",
            "As visually intoxicating as the film is on the outside, it's dimly vacant on the inside, with not even Eva Green's presence and charged performance able to hold the audiences attention.",
            "With its simple dialogues and also because it is in essence a gorgeous-looking tableaux, enjoy this slick slice of cinema more for its visuals rather than anything else.",
            "This is risk-taking, melodramatic stuff, but handled well.",
            "It is very rarely that we see good sequels and this one is not to be missed."

            "With lavish, warm cinematography capturing a magical-looking Mumbai... and some snappy dialogue between Hamm and Bell, Million Dollar Arm might not achieve anything remarkable, but takes a good swing at it nonetheless.",

            "American Sniper has a perspective that's recognizable from the classic Westerns Eastwood has long been associated with, both as an actor and a director. It's an existential critique of violent machismo that doubles as a celebration of violence.",

            "Cooper looks the part, having bulked up for it, but he can't do anything with the blandness of the character the script has given him. ",
            "We've seen it before, but Eastwood is good at making it seem raw and personal, largely by the care he takes in building a character, and the situations that will test them. ",
            "I enjoyed it well enough and it had me interested and at the edge of my seat from the start...",
            " American Sniper is a flawed yet fantastic film.",

            "There's nothing the least bit expressive or off-putting in Eastwood's lighting or framing. He understands classical film grammar and knows how to deploy it to maximum emotional effect.",
            "Clint Eastwood's sturdy, yet simplistic American Sniper doesn't really probe the depths of a Navy SEAL who reportedly killed 160 enemies in Iraq.",
            "This is a story that requires more than basic competence.",
            "The script and direction are unabashedly skewed towards feeding a lowest-common-denominator notion of war heroes and takes a righteous stand in favour of war, rather than exploring or portraying an authentic picture of the psychological impact...",
            "It is fitting, then, that such a quintessentially American director, who through his film personas has become something of a symbol of American masculinity, should be the one to so thoroughly deconstruct it on screen.",

            "Eastwood and Cooper's depiction of post-traumatic stress disorder is superb.",
            "For many, I suspect, American Sniper may be weirdly liberating-gratifying a perhaps hitherto unsuspected desire to see their pessimism, hopeless and unchanging, projected on the screen.",
            "Cooper embodies the battle-weary soldier well enough - the actor has buffed himself up considerably and he definitely has charisma to spare and he carries the film with ease.",
            "American Sniper honors the memory of Chris Kyle, an exemplary life of service and sacrifice.",

            "It's not a classic you'll rave about for days, and at 138 minutes it does go on too long, but for fans of Asian period action, it will certainly serve.",
            "Gorgeously photographed, edited with a crackle, lavishly populated and designed, this is a sheer non-mind-taxing crowd-pleaser",

            "The film has a mournful delicacy and sense of mystery about it which counterbalances its sentimentality.",
            "The gentle, unforced charm of the animation feels like the very best of book illustration come to miraculous life, but with a strong, almost Hitchcockian streak of excitement and danger.",
            "At times as awkward as its young protagonist, yet brimming with the familiar Ghibli magic.",
            "That's what Ghibli's films have always done - they sweep over you like summer showers, and leave the world seeming brighter and refreshed.",
            "It's a kid's movie that grown-ups will like. As Marnie does on Anna, the movie casts a spell.",
            "Dramatically unworthy of its gorgeous coastal landscapes and ever-shifting light.",
            "It's amazing how [Studio Ghibli] can so easily tap into the wonder and awe of young people. ",
            "There is a pervading sense of melancholy in this film, but you cannot help but be swept up in its stunning beauty. It is a totally immersive experience, like dipping your head into a watercolour painting and swimming about in it for two hours.",
            "Overall, When Marnie Was There is lovely to watch but it fails to provide the celebratory ending that Studio Ghibli deserves after 30 years of animation.",
            "The most Ghibli-esque touch here is the way that the natural and spirit worlds easily commingle, like overlapping cels in the same frame. ",
            "The mystery surprised me at times and kept a brisk pace.",
            "The allegory of the fantastic of Studio Ghibli's older productions, and particularly those of Miyazaki's, seems to be largely lost, and unfortunately, the film's technical prowess is not enough to surpass this issue.",
            "What other animated film would take the time to focus on a shot of fresh watermelon being cut, or of laundry waving in the breeze?",
            "Unlike American animated films, which only gesture at moral seriousness, Marnie and other films like it are centrally, sincerely concerned with the complex trials of adolescence.",
            "Directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi and adapted from Joan G Robinson's book, the film remains hauntingly beautiful to look at, but we're on pretty familiar ground by now.",
            "Marnie may be a quiet end to the pantheon of animated masterpieces that have streamed out of Hayao Miyazaki's studio, but the film is satisfying in its own way.",
            "Hiromasa Yonebayashi's film maintains the Ghibli traditions of elegant pastoral animation and nuanced emotional themes.",
            "Enigma takes second place to a sensitive exploration of adolescent turmoil and self-discovery, made even more beautiful and bittersweet by the film's delicate hand-drawn animation.",
            "It may not have the magic of Miyazaki's classic work, but if it is the last Ghibli film, it is an elegant and elegiac way to end of an era.",
            "The quasi-Sapphic intensity of Anna and Marnie's relationship - recalling Ghost World or a benign Heavenly Creatures - is poetically and sensitively handled.",
            "Japan's Studio Gibli has been responsible for some of the finest animated movies in recent decades, from 2003's Oscar-winning Spirited Away to last year's beautiful The Tale of the Princess Kaguya.",
            "Although more sombre than some of the studio's biggest hits, it has in spades the gorgeous, painstaking animation that has become Ghibli's trademark.",
            "What makes this a standout of the studio's already glittering catalogue is the strong root psychological motive of the central character, which could just have you reaching for the hankies by the end.",
            "Although the film doesn't quite wrap up the central mystery with the same degree of elegance, it does end with a hopeful message about learning to be comfortable in your own skin ..."

            "[Chadwick Boseman] gets the mannerisms right, and builds a volatile character who's opportunistic, frightening and vulnerable, like a funky Klaus Kinski.",
            "An arresting encapsulation of Brown's dichotomy of being at once a soulful singer and at the same time a man incapable of showing affection.",
            "Get On Up struggles, at times, to surprise us.",

            "Kevin Costner, at his most stony-faced, making a whole bunch of time-pressured phone calls, and rallying with fists clenched to exclaim \"I love this job!\", and so on.",
            "Ivan Reitman's dull-witted movie about the flurries of player trading on N.F.L. draft day might be a commercial for professional football.",
            "A human drama sprinkled with a number of laughs.",
            "Draft Day isn't even really about football. It's about coming into your own and finding clarity at a personal and professional crossroads. It's about doing your job. It's a day in the life.",
            "The film could have easily been a one-note sports flick, but it possesses a genuinely good spirit.",
            "A richly textured character study not only about a man and those around him, but about character, ethics and integrity...and yes, character does count.",
            "Draft Day is never surprising with its deliberate pace and conventional narrative choices. Inevitably, it becomes a convenient, cornball clich\u00e9.",
            "Though not as incompetent as the majority of its characters for a film that begins with a countdown on \"a day where lives are changed and fates are decided\", Draft Day presents bafflingly little tension and precious little point.",
            "Despite the overall acting and the less-than-compelling subplot involving Sonny's personal life, the film is terrific. It's smart, engaging, uplifting. It's great for all ages.",
            "While some the broad strokes of the story may be fairly easy to call out fairly early on, it packs in enough \"what's gonna happen?\" suspense to make the eventual third act payoff worth hanging in there for.",
            "Anyone looking for a lot of hard-hitting football highlights will be better off spending their time with NFL films and John Facenda.",
            "Kevin Costner's unexpected comeback continues with this surprisingly fine sports jam in the vein of Moneyball-it's not about the meal, it's about how the sausage gets made.",
            "As movies go, Draft Day is the equivalent of an 8-8 NFL team. Maybe even a 7-9. It is sporadically interesting, and suggests that it is worth sticking around for the final play. But there's no guarantee you will be satisfied with the outcome.",
            "We've seen lots of this type of Art of the Deal maneuvering-how GMs spread gossip, bait and switch, gamble, and haggle each other. It never gets old. It's also the best part.",
            "This is a very American film that - not unlike Moneyball - attempts to expand its appeal by doubling down on its focus on the very American sport at hand so as to find the universal themes intrinsic to the game. ",
            "For all of the typical sports movie clich\u00e9s that pop up in \"Draft Day,\" the pic's place as an NFL-sanctioned puff piece is what's most alarming.",
            "However unintentionally, \"Draft Day\" confirms that sports rewards heroes and villains alike. Remember Jerry Sandusky?",
            "It all gets rather corny, but Costner's charisma will keep you watching until the final whistle.",
            "Sports film fans will lap [Draft Day] up but others may struggle to keep their heads in the game. ",
            "This is a dangerous slice of propaganda that actually has the temerity to end with a family unit walking arm-in-arm into a rosy sunset. ",
            "Plays like Moneyball-lite ...",
            "Essentially this year's Moneyball, but set in American football rather than baseball, this fast-paced drama is brightly made with an especially strong cast."

            "Burton had a chance to make a powerful statement on the struggle for a woman to achieve artistic recognition and instead settled for another childlike fairy tale.",
            "A feminist psycho-melodrama made without insight or dramatic excitement.",
            "Big Eyes is Tim Burton's most intimate and subtle film since Ed Wood, to which it feels a companion piece.",
            "Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz are charismatic in the lead roles; occasionally they distract from the movie's overall smugness.",
            "It's not the kind of performance that screams for attention. No showboating physical transformation or wrenching psychological endurance test. She barely even raises her voice. But as the artist Margaret Keane, Amy Adams is quietly extraordinary.",
            "The more you think about it, the more you see all the subtextual tricks that were missed.",
            "The movie has merit as a depiction of an unusual episode in art history. Unfortunately, the director does not probe the incident in any depth, and what he does make of it is largely wrong. ",
            "It cannot be denied that it is picturesque at times, but only to support the provocative histrionics of the neurotic performances of Christoph Waltz and Amy Adams. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Big Eyes remains watchable thanks to Adams and Waltz, its few moments of Burtonesque flair, and the fascinating story it tells about art in the last half-century. ",
            "Big Eyes works because it gets the fundamentals of acting, directing, and screenwriting right. As in music, individual genius is great, but there's just no substitute for a band with good chemistry.",
            "[Amy] Adams' performance is refreshing and light, taking us on a powerful emotional journey performed with nuanced skill and heart.",
            "It's a likeable recapitulation of 1950s era America and the strange mutations that occur involving those humans attempting to buck the wrongly conditioned trappings of gender based social mores.",
            "DoP Bruno Delbonell buffs Burton's kitsch pop visuals to a soft sheen, but, like the script, they never dig deep enough into the emotional heart of this fascinating real-life story.",
            "It's a smooth, dreamy-looking film on the surface, but its two leads, Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz, are so out of sync and polarized they spoil the movie like acid curdles milk.",
            "It is a rare misstep for Burton who seems unsure what tone to adopt throughout. Certain visual and inventive flourishes of his are evident...et, he treats the vital moments in the story in a humdrum manner.",
            "Big Eyes proves to be an entertaining and enlightening look at society and its ideals.",
            "A melodrama with a comic touch, Big Eyes, is not meant to be a masterpiece, rather, an entertaining piece of art.",
            "BIG EYES doesn't aim too high and could be a way for Burton to quietly start coming back into form, even if that form is derivative of earlier work.",
            "The bizarre dysfunction afoot in the Keanes' marriage brings the best out of Burton as a filmmaker, who knows he is working with sensational material here.",
            "I'd certainly prefer to see more films like this from Burton rather than see him return to his old, worn-out habits.",
            "Margaret [Keane] might have experienced her awakening, but those expecting for Tim Burton's have to wait for the next round. ",
            "An incredible feminist journey and via his manipulation of the medium and our complicity transforms a domestic thriller into a work of art about art.",
            "The movie is big and amusing, and the shots of streets full of pastel vintage automobiles are worth the price of admission. It's terrific holiday fare.",
            "This film could have been made by anybody; Tim Burton didn't bring enough of his style to it... It's a good story, though, and Adams is memorable as a quietly tortured woman."

            "Big laughs and believable vulnerability. But it also has aged faster than Indiana Jones Nazis unable to spot the cup of a carpenter and relies on truly retrograde eye-rolling plot turns about reporters' motives.",
            "Featuring the funniest sex scene since Team America, and a film-stealing cameo from an unexpected rapper, Top Five is such an enjoyable watch that it's easy to ignore how slick and clever it often is.",

            "This movie attacks comedy in so many various ways: snark, sarcasm, quips, one-lines, everything on such an intellectual level, especially if you know the pop culture references being made via certain moments in hip-hop or mainstream media.",
            "Chris Rock bleeds many elements of his stand-up comedy routine into a person that is simply sick and tired of being famous for lowbrow pandering slapstick comedy, possibly like himself",
            "I went into Chris Rock's Top Five with a checklist of expectations, and I am happy to say that my expectations were met, and even exceeded in places.",
            "To watch this film is to see Chris [Rock]'s - and every comedian's - turbulent, messy, passionate, longstanding romance with his craft",
            "Top Five does the trick.",
            "Overall, I appreciate what this film does in showcasing a more serious Chris Rock. I think it's his best film to date.",
            "The romance is contrived; the sexual jokes rarely land; and the cameos seem more for show than for storytelling. That's not to say that I didn't laugh, or enjoy it, but it's horribly predictable, and about as frequently tasteless as it is charming",
            "Top Five gives us a glimpse of [Rock's] comic genius. Just a tad."

            "All movies require the audience to suspend some amount of disbelief, but Fading Gigolo almost goes too far. Almost.",
            "What makes Fading Gigolo unique is its sensitivity toward the female perspective, representing hooking in a positive light as an emotionally therapeutic practice.",
            "Whilst dryly humorous and happy to navigate -- sometimes successfully, sometimes not -- Jewish clich\u00e9s, Fading Gigolo's real charm lies in its warmth. ",
            "The music, as with the earthy set design, and the elegantly textural jewel-toned costuming, create a rich and sensual backdrop that make up for the flat characters and the somewhat improbable plot.",
            "Turturro is a brilliant actor and his directing is excellent; the screenplay, however, in another story -- well, I wish it were another story.",
            "Turturro's' direction is confident and mature. He loves New York and sets it to glowing with magic hour shoots and warm, welcoming interiors. He shoots his stars as though they were dreams, and despite the lurid premise, it's an innocent look at life.",
            "Despite a truly terrible title, John Turturro's \"Fading Gigolo\" is a surprisingly soulful and quiet comedy-drama.",
            "In the end these shenanigans are much ado about little. ",
            "The movie is a hot mess, which at times, frankly, could be hotter. For a movie about a sex worker, the sex isn't very sexy. ",
            "Gigolo is pure Woody Allen formula and provides the right amount of gags to keep this sex comedy afloat.",
            "While Fading Gigolo has potential, the delivery makes it a wholly frustrating watch.",
            "Cinematic links are made among graying sideburns, autumn leaves, decaying edifices and the grown-up pleasure of a jazz score. Sadly, the film is a leaky vessel. ",

            "Tone-deaf, ugly to look at... Fading Gigolo is one man's tribute to himself, decades too late.",
            "In his own films, Woody tends to give the meatiest lines to his costars while he walks off with the wisecracks. Here he finds a most gracious host in Turturro, who happily focuses the spotlight on his prize casting coup."

            "At 150 minutes, it's a little too long but there are stretches during its course when it captivates and amazes.",
            "You leave \"Mr. Turner,\" as with all good fact-based films, wanting to know more about this man and his work - and remembering that beautiful, almost touchable light, on the canvas and on the screen.",
            "For modern moviegoers, the earthy \"Mr. Turner\" may seem like slowly steeped tea with an unpleasant aftertaste. But while some are impatiently waiting for the paint to dry, astute viewers will see a cinematic landscape bloom.",
            "If the past is a foreign country, then \"Mr. Turner\" is one of the most rhapsodic foreign films you may ever see.",

            "I've not in years seen an onscreen character that feels as fully-realized as Turner, and Spall's seamless performance combined with the immaculate set and costume design and stunning photography makes for a film that feels like a time machine.",
            "What a fine film it is: rich, enjoyable, imaginative, faithful to Turner's spirit.",
            "It is such an extraordinary revelation, a breathtaking and acutely observed meditation on the intricacies of Victorian life, complete with a tour de force by Timothy Spall as the painter JMW Turner.",
            "... it's the British director's best film in years.",
            "All in all, the &#8232;150-minute Mr. Turner is an impressive accomplishment, laudable for the way it uses the figure of a single artist to explore both art and cinema.",
            "Apart from the fantastic characterizations and top-notch cinematography, the real beauty of Turner's vision was his ability to find beauty in the seemingly ordinary.",
            "The resulting portrait, with all its mystery and theater, is utterly fascinating and emotionally expansive, as only Mike Leigh films are.",
            "To call Mr. Turner one of the year's most overrated films seems unfair, as it's worth watching for beautiful cinematography and a plethora of gentle laughs.",
            "Leigh's camera searches this world through slow and ponderous movements, every gesture by an actor as carefully calculated as the forceful actions Turner throws onto his canvases. ",
            "J.M.W. Turner might well be the role Spall is forever linked to, like Sir Ben Kingsley and Gandhi. It is a virtuoso performance, but it is also great fun.",
            "It is by turns funny, tragic and savage, but the strongest sense both leave us with is one of wistful mourning. It's not easy being an artist.",
            "It is both off-putting and amusingly fascinating to watch the portrayal of the past 20 years or so of Turner's life, as a man who changed the perception of landscape artistry.",
            "It's certainly not a bad film, but aside from Spall's performance and the cinematography, this is one of [Leigh's] lesser works.",
            "Thanks to Spall's marvelous, gruntingly animalistic performance, Pope's eye, and Leigh's deep methodology, Mr. Turner gives us an immersion if not an understanding of the gnomic artist. "

            "Scenes between YSL and rock-steady lover Pierre Berg\u00e9 (Guillaume Gallienne) spark, but the film stays too reverent to truly turn heads. ",
            "This glitzy biopic of the renowned French fashion designer doesn't offer much insight into its subject or milieu.",
            "The film takes on a dour note as way too much time is spent on Saint Laurent's drunken antics. He comes across as sullen and not very likable. This may be true to the man, but what of his other side?",
            "Does a film with haute couture as its heart guarantee an elegant cinematic experience? In the case of Yves Saint Laurent, a biopic about the legendary French couturier, the answer is a tired non.",
            "Despite being sumptuously shot and competently assembled, it provides no real insight into the tortured mind of its subject or the creative process in general.",
            "Yves Saint Laurent, while magnificent in cinematography and dutiful in story, probably could have pushed itself further to create a more dynamic telling of the wunderkind's life and work.",
            "Yves Saint Laurent may have suffered from being one of two separate biopics about the fashion icon, and the more narratively straightforward of the pair. Luckily, the strengths of the performances help make for an entertaining, engaging drama.",
            "A formulaic \"fallen genius\" film that represents its influential subject and the fashion industry respectfully, but it would have been a better film had it just dug a little deeper.",
            "Even with its flaws, Yves Saint Laurent is a satisfying film on a purely visual level.",
            "Lespert has played it safe but stylish.",
            "Therein lies the problem with the biopic, whilst beautifully shot with exquisite shots of Parisian and Moroccan interiors, clothes and wonderful soundtrack it feels all very carefully managed. ",
            "It seems like Bertrand Bonello asumes the spectator knows every detail of the complicated life Yves Saint Laurent lived. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "If design is a fine art (YSL was the subject of a Met show), then this is a designer's \"Lust for Life\". ",
            "Pierre Niney Niney has a strong, yet fragile presence, as if he's in a Woody Allen film being directed by the ghost of Anthony Minghella.",
            "stylish-boy, is it stylish-but lacking in substance. ",
            "The resulting bio-drama feels like any other generic formula self-destructive artist tale, one that captures the surface of Saint Laurent, but not his essence.",
            "One of the issues is that Lespert provides little insight into Saint Laurent's creative genius.",
            "The genius of the title remains as inscrutable as ever.",
            "Yves Saint-Laurent is an elegantly filmed and exceptionally acted biopic that may be too tasteful a drama for such a ravishing figure.",
            "Yves Saint Laurent as portrayed in the film comes off as no deeper than a symbol, much like that familiar brand logo that dominates the key poster art.",
            "A visually sumptuous - and perhaps languidly paced - tale that immerses the viewer in a deeply atmospheric world.",
            "This biopic of 'fashion's little prince' offers all the elegant precision of a fashion shoot - it's beautiful, and cold - but lacks a lot of necessary context.",
            "Alternately meek and tyrannical, repressed and Dionysian, Niney's Saint Laurent remains both empathetic and obscure."

            "With Bennett Miller's Foxcatcher, we have a film which, despite devoting significant screentime to the sport of large men in tights, has as its main theme the absolutely corrosive effect of too much money on just about everything. ",

            "As with the approach settled on by Miller, the writers and the performers, the fancy and the high-strung have no place in Foxcatcher. Just raw, as is, cold served style.",

            "It isn't one film but many, an anthology of expertly recreated genre tropes, from fog-shrouded noir to sunlit paranoia.",
            "I think I need to see it again, again.",
            "Watching Paul Thomas Anderson's wonderfully textured and intricate LA-set Inherent Vice, you are easily reminded of the famous story about Howard Hawks' version of The Big Sleep.",
            "Paul Thomas Anderson's Inherent Vice provides a rush of pure hallucinogenic pleasure, but its logic is mighty hard to follow.",
            "As rich and strange as we've come to expect from the \"late\" Anderson films, but doesn't quite achieve the digressive whackadoo majesty of the novel.",
            "This is a Paul Thomas Anderson film and, yeah, he's done it again.",
            "Inherent Vice is a movie best lived as an experience. Sit back and let Anderson take you on a ride hazy ride, accept it like a cloud of smoke blown into your face, and feel what comes.",
            "The plot might be a bit all over-the-place and hard to follow at times, but if you just sit back and let the movie take control, Inherent Vice turns out to be a fun ride.",
            "An allegory to film noir, the conspiracy of cults, hippie culture and conspiracy theories. Topics that don't seem to fit in with Anderson's world. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "It's like watching a film noir while stoned... Nothing makes sense.",
            "The think I liked the most about this movie is that it seemed to perfectly encapsulate Southern California in the 70s.",
            "I'm firmly on the side of loving it, but I know it's not for everybody. It's the kind of thing you'll like if you like that kind of thing.",

            "Compulsively watchable and suitably frustrating, this stoner noir is one of Anderson's cleverest films, no doubt - but by some distance his least wise.",
            "PTA gets loose with the film noir form only to better honor its essential dualities: people's simultaneous longing for and dreading of the truth, their desire to see things clearly or instead remain in the idealized world of their (intoxicated) mind...",
            "A hilariously louche and ramshackle psychedelic noir, Inherent Vice is an audacious stylistic leap for Anderson, but his risks pay off beautifully. ",
            "I can count on one hand the times I've fallen asleep in a theater; at [Inherent] Vice I suspect my body was telling me this film was never going to get better, so why not do something more worthwhile with my time?",
            "Something doesn't quite click in Inherent Vice, but is still worthwhile to check out. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "We're impressed with the evocation of times gone by and with Anderson's ability to adapt Pynchon's dense prose for the screen. Angeleno viewers may be made especially nostalgic",
            "It's an exhausting task to wrap your mind around, but this is the type of film you have to turn something off to let it all in, and for that reason alone makes Inherent Vice beautiful, yet elusive.",
            "I connected on an emotional level with it the first time, but I suspect I may find it better on repeat viewings; there is a masterpiece in there somewhere, I just have to dig deeper to find it.",
            "A fog of uncertain motivations ... make it hard to ever get purchase on the film and truly engage with it.",
            "\"Inherent Vice\" is foggy, sprawling and shaggy, yet epic in its own way."

            "Has the elements of a classic backstage story, but they don't quite crystallize into an integral drama.",
            "It's a movie about a rising superstar that features two of them-Mbatha-Raw and Parker, both enormously appealing, impossibly attractive performers with big futures ahead of them.",
            "\"Beyond the Lights\" is a faint shadow of 1992's \"The Bodyguard,\" without the star power of Whitney Houston or Kevin Costner.",
            "Director Prince-Bythewood, who made the move from television to the big-screen in 2000 with the terrific romance Love and Basketball has a way with actors.",
            "This quality drama about the all-consuming nature of fame desperately aspired to - and then precariously achieved - deserved to find a much wider audience upon original release.",

            "It is an interesting film but the romantic sub-plot detracted from what could have been an interesting independent film.",
            "Although the intrigue and intensity waxes and wanes, it is a decent film about love, overbearing mothers, and the cost of fortune and fame.",
            "It might be a broad stereotype, but that side of the pond tends to produce very well-trained, versatile thespians.",

            "The Two Faces of January is a poor imitation and the characters never develop much after the first 15 minutes of the film - what you see is all you get.",
            "It's an elegant, hypnotically glamorous, old-school thriller of the kind that has become a rarity, and solidifies Isaac as one of Hollywood's most compelling new leading men.",
            "A slick Sunday-afternoon flick.",
            "[Patricia Highsmith's] world is gloomy, but it's nuanced. It's fun. That's not the world in [The Two Faces of] January, which seems incapable of humor or irony. Which isn't to say it fails.",
            "Whether it's as a starving misanthropic musician or a mysterious American swindler in Greece, Oscar Isaac positively oozes charisma",

            "The film never rises to the level of brilliant, but it has its brilliant moments. Many brilliant moments. And as a kind of off-kilter character study of three people in way over their collective heads, the story exudes a certain fascination.",
            "It's a classy looking movie for sure, and as pleasant a travelogue as Ripley was in its day. But Highsmith's psychological edge is absent for much of this and its shade of noir has suffered a serious bleaching in all that Mediterranean sun."

            "Maggie Smith serves up one of her finer performances as of late. ",
            "With a fair few unpredictable twists and an avoidance, for the most part, of more overt romantic tropes, My Old Lady is a fascinating chamber piece, even if it is all a bit too rosy at the end after thoroughly raking up the dirt. ",
            "This may not be the best film I've seen this year, but it might be the most surprising.",
            "My Old Lady is a mature piece of filmmaking but while its pace lets it down, Kline, Smith and Scott Thomas do not disappoint.",

            "It's very easy to imagine the story on stage, but the transition to film maintains a powerful degree of intimacy. ",
            "Smith and Scott Thomas fare better than Kline, who is too eager to force his own rubbery comic personality through his character's considerable flaws. He's also terrible at drunk acting.",
            "The plot thread that entangles all these people and places may not be entirely unexpected, but it's all handled with enough sensitivity and panache to keep us engaged.",
            "It's a big ask for these characters to unburden themselves from years of emotional baggage with a balance of humour and pathos, but the classy cast get pretty close to pulling it off.",

            "I needed a little something to lift my spirits, and I found \"My Old Lady\" did the trick. ",
            "Kline and Smith have some nice moments together, even if the transition from breezy comedy into more serious drama is clumsy.",
            "Just when you think the story is going to proceed on a well-worn, cosily romantic track, its characters unpack their emotional baggage, revealing unexpected depths of hurt and taking the film into bittersweet dramatic territory."

            "The jokes are never-ending and multilayered, calculated so that adults do not get bored -- which is important, because they buy the tickets. It's all bolted together with precision and good humour, although not much whimsy.",
            "Penguins of Madagascar is an unexpected pleasure, a 3D kids' animated feature that combines a wildly inventive visual style with enough in-jokes and self-reflexive references to keep film- loving adults happy, too.",
            "An amusing voice cameo from Werner Herzog sets the comedy bar high, but although the high-energy hi-jinks thrill the younger members of the audience, there is less to engage their accompanying adults.",
            "At last: they're upgraded to the starring roles they deserved all along.",
            "The beginning of Penguins of Madagascar is so funny it makes you almost weep.",
            "As memorable as the 5384th Cheese Dibble you ate.",

            "It's actually really funny. It reminded me of the first Naked Gun movie.",
            "A clever, rapid-fire barrage of pop culture references and dizzying one-liners, all delivered with a self-awareness that only adds to the fun. ",
            "Sorpresivamente, Ping\u00fcinos de Madagascar es una entretenida y reconfortante animaci\u00f3n que a fin de cuentas termina siendo m\u00e1s astuta de lo que realmente parece ser y muy superior a cualquier entrega de Madagascar.",
            "The results are usually deft, paced fast as coherence will allow and often very, very cute.",
            "The super-spy wannabes seize the big-screen spotlight for the first time with \"Penguins of Madagascar,\" a funny, frenetic and ultimately forgettable spin-off.",
            "The pace is brisk - frenzied, even - the animation top-notch and the script is full of witticisms, puns ... and there are jokes aplenty for the kiddies as well as belly-busters for the grown-ups. ",
            "Thank goodness, the film-makers did not try to make sense of this spin-off from the Madagascar series by making a prequel or sequel. What they have produced is a glorious non-sequitur.",
            "There are enough sight gags and silly jokes in Penguins of Madagascar to make children laugh. But a generation-spanning film, this one isn't.",
            "Directed by Eric Darnell and Simon J Smith, Penguins of Madagascar is relentlessly madcap, happily all over the place, and almost awesome in its refusal to adhere to any coherence.",
            "This movie can babysit your kids! And as the reviewer often recommends in regards to movies such as this, a good adult nap in a cineplex is an awesome thing.",
            "Thoroughly enjoyable and unreservedly recommended.",
            "Not a bad way to kill a few hours these holidays.",
            "There's nothing of substance here, but there needn't be. It's just pure escapist fun, wittily delivered.",
            "From its icily satirical start to its madcap end, this is more than a snappy, silly spin-off. It takes those cutest widdle critters, then cannon-fires them through a story cannily undercutting the cuteness factor on which so much animal animation relies.",
            "An animated film should entertain kids, while at the same time, appeal to adults. Frequently, adults are left out of the equation. And, sometimes the action is so frenetic, that only anklebiters get anything out of it. Such is the case with POM."

            "It may be the second best \"woman takes wild, wacky trip across Los Angeles\" comedy to come out in the last decade, but it is still a pretty good, pretty funny movie.",
            "Despite Banks' swashbuckling performance, Walk of Shame is about as mediocre as they come.",
            "Banks telegraphs a sassy strut in this mean streets LA underbelly romp. A satirically served up slice of life flaky fugitive satire, bent on pegging the really shameful party here - a commercial media whose narrow focus ranges from dishonest to shallow.",
            "If you don't think it's hilarious that a woman dressed for a night out would 'naturally' be mistaken for a prostitute, there is nothing here for you.",

            "[Brill] gets a few enjoyable sequences out of the unlikely culture clashes and a couple of the supporting performances produce funny moments. But it's mostly Banks who keeps the film going ...",
            "It would all be galling if it weren't so lame. But Walk of Shame is notable only for turning the unendingly adorable Banks into an unlikable figure.",
            "If anyone walks away unblemished from Walk of Shame, it's Banks, who throws herself into every bit of physical comedy and humiliation the movie sends her way. ",
            "A solid vehicle for Elizabeth Banks to show off her comedic chops",
            " Walk of Shame is the sort of film that drops a bombshell into a crackhouse, and you kinda wish she never had to leave the crackhouse... When she leaves, the film just rushes from scenario to scenario to tell the same joke. Over and over.",
            "It's the rare goofy comedy in dire need of thoughtfulness, the kind of reality that's implicit in male-driven movies because life's so male-dominated in the first place.",
            "Banks delivers an amusing slapstick turn in this otherwise strained, formulaic comedy.",
            "Feels like the Hollywood equivalent of a joke about the boss' golf game at a company Christmas party.",
            "As for Banks, the sparkle she typically brings to funny business is missing, often caught struggling to summon enthusiasm for Brill's flaccid screenwriting. "

            "Shirks its responsibility to be about anything. Still, decent fun.",
            "Edge of Tomorrow is a decent time waster, but if you're the sort of person who watches a movie every day, you should probably look for something better.",
            "The smartest blockbuster of this summer season, or perhaps any summer season.",
            "The 51-year-old Cruise clearly relishes playing the flawed hero - one who gets to be smarmy, duplicitous, exasperated, intimidated, bad-ass and wise.",
            "On face value, Doug Liman's Edge Of Tomorrow deals with familiar tropes - of a war for the planet and time loops and alien invasions - but it's brilliantly executed with some fantastic combat sequences.",
            "Edge of Tomorrow is proof, once again, that Cruise can certainly be knocked down but can never be counted as completely out.",
            "Liman deftly orchestrates the destruction, ensuring it doesn't sink into mind-numbing Transformers fare. Blunt and Cruise invest a great deal of heart in their action heroics, thankfully minimising the hokum romance angle. ",
            "The strength of the lead performances and the inventive use of sci-fi conventions make this better than the usual mainstream fare.",
            "Edge of Tomorrow represents another consistent film from director Doug Liman. From projects such as The Bourne Identity, The O.C. to Mr and Mrs Smith, this film is by far his best work.",
            "This is exactly the raucous, smart adventure that you want out of a big summer blockbuster release.",
            "\"Edge of Tomorrow\" is a fun, rip-roaring sci-fi actioner ... It has explosions and gunfire and aliens, yet it's also very smart with a wicked sense of humor.",

            "It was pretty exciting.",
            "I guess I liked it?",
            "Edge of Tomorrow threatens to become a repetitive bore, yet at each plausible juncture, its formula veers inextricably into new facets of intrigue, at least enough to keep wandering attention spans at bay. ",
            "Edge of Tomorrow deserves praise and viewers. It is proof that calculated cynicism and recycled content aren't the only ways to deliver big-budget, mainstream entertainment. ",
            "This is the best we've seen from Tom Cruise in years, and Emily Blunt wears her heroism well.",
            "Groundhog Day meets Aliens, and it's great.",
            "This movie had the potential to be a great renovation for the alien invasion genre, instead it chose to be an incoherent love story. Edge of Tomorrow is entertaining but still, it's a waste of a good idea. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "The most fun you're likely to have watching someone else play a video game any time soon.",
            "A full octane bit of escapism that proves to be a pretty good time at the movies.",
            "Edge of Tomorrow, starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, is smart, fun and doing more to equalize the battle of the sexes than most action films."

            "What We Do in the Shadows does more than just erase the crap path these immortal suckers were on, it proves there are still stories to be told in the dark.",

            "Immortality can't all be glam, cloak-swishing nights out or chases pursued by pitchfork-waving villagers. At some point someone has to sort out the recycling and wash up the blood-spattered plates. Funny, clever, weirdly believable and eminently quotable.",

            "Funny, charming kiddie-flick fare.",
            "On every level, [Shawn] Levy and company up the ante, excelling with visual, story, and character expansiveness, endearing each to our hearts even more.",
            "The most poignant moment is the farewell to Roosevelt, played one final time by Robin Williams. Otherwise, Night At The Museum: Secret Of The Tomb is an instance of an idea stretched far beyond its potential.",
            "Unfortunately even these innocent franchises can strain the tenuous chord of likability they have and I'm afraid that is what Night at the Museum 3: Secret of the Tomb has done.",
            "Proving a third visit isn't always a good thing, \"Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb\" is a film that feels like it is stuck in idle.",
            "Not only are a large proportion of the gags repetitive, but they're also delivered by actors who are simply phoning it in.",
            "This fairly entertaining kiddie comedy is full of funny little asides and exchanges that keep the pace going. ",
            "Secret Of The Tomb -- not as good as the first movie, but not as bad as the second one either -- attempts to recapture the purposefulness of the original movie, where there was a sense of a quest.",
            "If only we cared more, this might still be OK, but we don't, thanks largely to a noticeable decline in the writing.",
            "Despite its change of venue, \"Secret\" covers all the ground trod in the original but loses any sense of wonder.",
            "Secret of the Tomb feels a little lightweight on the story end. Most of the narrative is pretty linear, and it feels even thinner than its 90-minute run time.",
            "The feeling upon the closing credits is one of relief; with the plot nicely tied up, hopefully Shawn Levy gets the hint and finally moves on to try new things with his career.",
            "As if to make amends for the dubious ethics of the previous sequel (why did Ben Stiller get to decide 'his' museum exhibits were more worthy of life than the ones in the Smithsonian?), this supposed series finale has something of a wised-up, elegiac tone.",
            "You may not find many original moments in the corny humor of \"Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb.\" But, you will enjoy time spent with old friends in this third and final film in the series. ",

            "The core charm of the series has always revolved around fusty old museum exhibits coming to life after opening hours, and the novelty still hasn't quite worn off."

            "When you have the fortune of landing an actor like Del Toro, it's almost criminal to spend so much time watching the scales fall from an innocent's eyes when we could be watching a master actor convey quiet, sleepy-eyed, mumbling menace.",
            "A decent and fictional thriller that does its job of being entertaining. [Full review in Spanish].",
            "An entertaining and suitably gruesome gangster thriller which nevertheless feels like a missed opportunity. Benicio del Toro is suitably weighty and fascinating in the lead role.",

            "If only we had a more believable hero, and weren't feeling so disappointed at how little of the villain we get.",
            "While this may be Hutcherson's movie and he does a decent job, he stands no chance against Del Toro, the charismatic powerhouse. The latter may always be typecast as a kingpin, but he never fails to make his characters riveting.",
            "It's a shame that Escobar: Paradise Lost devotes so much screentime to its invented hero, because the portions with del Toro can be very fine indeed.",
            "There are few actors that commit to their roles as much as Benecio Del Toro... as he demonstrates quite spectacularly at times as one of the most infamous drug-lords of the past century in Escobar: Paradise Lost.",
            "The fact that the filmmakers felt the need to manufacture a Canadian surfer character to be the 'mainstream' moviegoer's likable, trustworthy guide through Escobar-land is a revealing and presumptuous demonstration of racial/cultural myopia.",
            "Menacingly entertaining.",
            "Surprisingly forgettable considering its mesmering villain, although Del Toro sparks the movie into life with what screentime he does get.",

            "Nick might usurp most of the screen time, but it's Mr. Del Toro, face flickering from benevolent to vicious and body heaving with literal and symbolic weight, who seizes the film."

            "Despite Noah's vivid surface appeal, it ultimately fails to recreate the tale's original sense of thematic unity, and thus becomes acutely aware of its own deprived meaning. ",

            "Throw in some plot holes that left me annoyed, and it was a rough way to spend two hours and 18 minutes.",
            "Noah is a worthy, ambitious mess of a movie, and as a deeply personal new take on an old tale, it's the kind of mess we could use a bit more often from Hollywood.",
            " Once the film has blown it's CGI load, it turns into a kitchen sink drama, an episode of Eastenders as directed by Mike Leigh.",
            "However, it is a vessel of work - much like Noah's dependable yet claustrophobic Ark - that can hold its share against rough waters while finding a point of tranquility in its cautionary life lessons of human misguidance and mischievousness.",
            "Darren Aronofsky's take on the story of Noah's Ark intuitively imagines the whole saga within the grammar of a more familiar fantasy-action, Lord of the Rings-style universe.",
            "The real star of the movie, however, is the flood -- to call the special effect spectacular is selling it short.",
            "It takes the material in interesting and bold directions, making for a film that can be enjoyed by everyone and not just those of faith."

            "While this deeply romanticized and fictionalized account of a little-known underdog might not serve you in any trivia capacities, it's also a worthy and loving story of humanity in the face of oppression.",
            "A great cast along with Loach's trademark realism and capable storytelling deliver a tale of quiet power, with an ending that is sure to deliver of a jolt of righteous outrage.",

            "This is Loach at his best.",
            "Whilst it shone a light on someone that most people had never heard of is much in Loach's favour it would have been a reacher experience if the film covered more of his life before his departure to New York, there are only a limited flashbacks.",
            "The film feels flat, self-consciously preachy and not a patch on my own favourite, Land And Freedom. ",
            "With a romantic lyricism that never dips into sentimentality, he (Loach) has captured the poetry of populism that has always driven his work.",
            "Barry Ward's handsome, charismatic hero is a romanticised figure (in reality Gralton was middle-aged and balding), which wouldn't matter if his character had been given more depth and shade.",

            "It's mildly entertaining but suffers from the one problem common to all these movies -- that the enemy is so vile, there is little shading.",
            "... a soft-focus, minor film. It's not bad, but it could have been better. Hence the heartbreak.",
            "Even an ultimately forgettable effort from this esteemed social-realist director can't help but achieve eloquence in its affirmation of basic human decency.",
            "The king of the \"kitchen sink\" drama, Loach may not make action-packed sugar candy or anything remotely resembling American genre, but he does know how to render people in their natural surroundings.",
            "It's rare to see a film that presents its characters -- working-class 'bog' folk and haughty clergy alike -- without a trace of condescension or caricature; it's rarer still to see a movie that unambiguously champions so-called radical politics.",

            "Perhaps more ambitious than its means, it's a film that manages to intrigue and engross with a narrative that virtually creates the odor of the musty, yellowed pages of the writing style it's been borrowed from. ",
            "Forget four dimensions; Predestination struggles to break out of two. ",
            "...a notably imaginative film noir that craftily elevates the genre into an alluring confection. Dark, moody and visibly challenging, Predestination gleefully plots and twists its way into a hearty submission of inspired Science Fiction contemplation.",

            "Very smart writing and editing, and a rare film to get time travel right.",
            "For a faithful adaptation of a short story, the film is packed with plot twists and narrative surprises and the challenge faced by the Spierig Brothers is obscuring details that would give away the twists without making it obvious. ",
            "This is cerebral sci-fi with a strong emotional undertow, largely thanks to Snook, who gives a heart-tugging performance as the gender-addled person of mystery.",
            "Trippy sci-fi thriller.",
            "A largely faithful adaptation of a 1958 Robert A. Heinlein short story, Michael and Peter Spierig's Predestination is a time-travel yarn that worked fine as a 13-page read, but as a film the time-bendy elements come across as sub-Primer at best.",
            "Hawks and Snook's performances pack a surprising emotional punch, and even if you spot the film's big twist coming you will still want to watch it all over again to spot all the deftly placed clues.",
            "Sarah Snook gives an immaculate, wholly-formed Star Is Born performance of the first order.",
            "Perhaps the best adaptation to date of a story written by science fiction legend Robert A. Heinlein. This is a very complex story and it is handled well by The Spierig Brothers, who co-wrote and co-directed the film.",

            "Assayas never set out to contemplate the (un)reality of [the celebrity actor] world in the first place. Or did he?",
            "It has superb performances by Juliette Binoche and Kristen Stewart. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Sils Maria is the ultimate hangout movie. Maybe when I say hangout movie you think of Richard Linklater or Kevin Smith, but I'd take Kristen Stewart and Juliette Binoche spending quality time on a mountain over those any day. [TOP 50 FILMS OF THE DECADE]",
            "It took its time, but Clouds of Sils Maris is definitely a memorable and thought-provoking festival watch driven home by the excellent performances and chemistry between Binoche and Stewart.",
            "Assayas has built a beautiful character driven drama of depth and resonance all centered around the interactions between three women with well-developed complex rules.",
            "While Assayas is busy naval-gazing, the three actresses manage to snatch Clouds of Sils Maria away from him - keeping the focus where it ought to be in the first place.",
            "Clouds of Sils Maria pertinently discusses the nature of interpreting art, but its tedious attention to paparazzi-plagued celebrities is shallower and skews its already meandering trajectory.",
            "Clouds of Sils Maria is at its most captivating when observing the discourse between Binoche and Stewart as the pair masterfully ricochet lines off one another in a volatile ballet of remarkable linguistic dexterity.",
            "It's rare to see such a well-developed, female-centric dramas these days, so kudos to Assayas for writing/directing one that also feels authentic.",
            "A fantastic commentary on modern celebrity, PR, image politics and the struggle to retain personal integrity amid the sheer swirl of the internet and digital media culture.",
            "A finely crafted psychological study and thriller that operates on several levels, the here and now, the past, and the future and the way our personas shift over time around an unchanging core, like The Snake.",
            "A multi-faceted portrait of a woman confronting the demons of age and obsolescence... This is an enjoyable, well written and well acted, serious and yet consistently entertaining movie from beginning to end.",
            "hat kind of lightness and ease of movement really carries you past some script miscues and tonal shifts to make Clouds of Sils Maria an enjoyable experience.",
            "Assayas knows the elite region of entertainers inside and out, and Stewart's performance will make you see her beyond the horrors and stupidities of the Twilight series.",
            "\"Clouds of Sils Maria\" is simply stunning, visually as well as with its story and acting. It raises questions of immortality, aging, and what success truly is. It is a story of one woman's life - it's a story of every woman's life.",
            "... this variation on \"All About Eve\" is far smarter and more deft at avoiding clich\u00e9 - or at least having fun with it - than most films that are made about the lives of performers."

            "Still, the movie is so denuded of insight and incident it ends up more cartoonish than the comic book that spawned it.",
            "The second half, after Arterton has embarked on an affair with the son of a local landowner, does slightly disappoint, hampered by a story that doesn't quite make sense and by parallels to Flaubert that many won't get.",

            "A heavily eroticised Arterton enlivens the lumpy Franglais dialogue and Luchini wrings laughs from the unlovely vantage of voyeuristic saddo. But that's not enough to hold the film together, or, indeed, the viewer's interest.",
            "Fontaine's film isn't as slyly satirical as Simmonds' original, but her rural locations and leading lady are equally ravishing, and the frisky rapport between Arterton and Lucchini is a joy.",

            "Alexandre Aja's sprawling, wildly uneven film suffers from its continual shifts in storytelling style. It's at its best as a Twin Peaks-style mystery with supernatural elements.",
            "Radcliffe, through his sheer presence and the piercing honesty of those big, blue eyes, makes this mixed-up material watchable.",
            "Horns juggles a lot of balls, and admirably keeps them in the air for longer than you might expect. But it doesn't know how to bring them down gently.",
            "We get slithering snakes, rock music, woozy camera angles. And zero sense of danger. Without that ingredient, Horns feels like Harry Potter meets Ken Russell.",
            "Regardless of its sloppiness I did enjoy this movie and it isn't one of those movies I regret wasting my time to watch...",
            "It deserved better luck than being relegated to oblivion. A shame. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "[A] decadent delight...multi-pronged, interwoven tapestry of Biblical allegory that pushes the boundaries to almost sacrilegious silliness, but then artfully reins itself in with the strength of performances, indelible visuals and pure unadulterated fun.",
            "If you yearn for a horror film trying to offer something new, Horns will certainly keep your interest.",
            "Horns finds its horror in (hyper) reality, and it's all the better for it.",
            "Hill's story is actually a beautiful romance disguised as a horror-comedy. If you let it, Horns will grab hold of you.",
            "If the fact that the film stars Harry Potter isn't enough for you (it was enough for me), then see it because it's a good story that is not only dark and ominous but also has some hilarity mixed in. ",
            "Radcliffe is amazing, and the film is worth the price of admission just for his performance. It's just unfortunate that the film around him is guilty of a bit of sloth.",
            "It's not scary enough to be a horror, not funny enough to be a comedy, too \"adult\" to be embraced by the \"YA\" crowd and far too infantile to be embraced by the \"A\" crowd. ",
            "Sadly the film's m\u00e9lange of ingredients never quite come together, and whilst Aja constantly attempts to root Hill's novel in the present, Keith Bunin's screenplay is too anomalous to hold our attention. ",
            "Horns is best watched as a midnight movie, with your intoxicant of choice, and possibly as part of a marathon.",
            "Horns simply feels like a misfire that could have been an awesome mash-up of black comedy, sleuthing, and fantastical romantic drama, all with provocative commentary on religion and the never-ending discussion of good vs evil",
            "It's not that there's no value to Horns, it's just that what value there is, is severely handicapped by a dumb script.",
            "No one's going to pretend that Horns lives up to its source material, or even achieves any tonal consistency.",
            "Ultimately, its best results are too few and far between - to which excuses for its tone and intent can only go so far.",
            "At nearly two hours, \"Horns\" is about 30 minutes longer than it needs to be. But it's doubtful even a shorter version would cure what ails this film. Maybe you have to be tripped out on LSD to appreciate it.",
            "Draws out a heretofore unseen compassion in Aja, who dials the grue way down and focuses on the terrific cast he's hired.",
            "There are times when you will want to look away from the horrors shown on the screen but it will be hard to wipe the smile off your face."

            "Cliches abound in this waterlogged post-Cold War thriller from director Kevin Macdonald.",
            "Director Kevin Macdonald successfully ties the psychological tension with the physical, using the tight confines of a submarine setting rather masterfully, squeezing each drop of tension and expertly pacing every plot twist in Dennis Kelly's screenplay.",
            "With stunning underwater visuals, and a story that is engaging enough despite its obvious turns, there may be gold here yet."

            "Despite a few too-cute moments, the movie is both smarter and more sympathetic than that glib shorthand.",

            "Obvious Child is sweetness swaddled in a dirty joke.",
            "Robespierre has fashioned an assertion of female worth within the confines of mainstream cinema. This is primarily accomplished through the film's sharp, acerbic dialogue and some beautifully rendered characters.",
            "Where Obvious Child succeeds is in letting women be funny, not in the faux-humor of humiliation that too many comedic actresses in movies are subjected to these days, but in actual laugh-out-loud funny lines and situations.",
            "Obvious Child is a quiet movie, in a way; no one needs saving, and everyone's going to be ok. But it feels like a big film all the same.",
            "As Donna, [Jenny Slate] is vulnerable but not pathetic, and her actions and reactions are entirely believable.",
            "Beyond the identity politics and humor, Obvious Child goes the extra mile to represent a seldom voiced, moderate position about a hot button topic.",
            "It doesn't overtly try to be anything more than what it is, which makes it that much more cool to watch.",
            "It's a big step forward that [Gillian] Robespierre's indie comedy never treats whether Donna should have an abortion as a debate; Instead, the film addresses what happens once that decision is made.",

            "Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, have clearly seen their share of crappy unnecessary sequels, and want to assure us that 22 Jump Street will follow proudly in that tradition.",
            "'22 Jump Street' tries to catch a meta-wave on the shoulders of its stars, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum.",
            "This sequel to the hit action comedy 21 Jump Street is better all around: the pacing is more consistent, the sight gags more imaginative, the self-referential jokes sharper.",
            "22 Jump Street is hardly fresh, but the picture has enough energy to get by.",
            "22 Jump Street is pretty much the exact same movie as 21 Jump Street. It knows it, you know it, and it knows that you know it. And that is why it's brilliant.",
            "Self-referential irony is hardly a new gimmick, having served as the underlying premise for such franchises as Scream and Austin Powers, but rarely has it been indulged with such fervor. ",
            "It's safe to say that it has been quite awhile since a film this messy has also been such an absolute blast.",
            "A mere shadow of the first film to be sure, there are glaring flaws, and jokes take way too long to play out and don't pay off considering the investment, but if you're looking for a raucous comedy fix, this fits the bill well enough. ",
            "The movie pokes fun at [action movie conventions], yet tries to stay its own entity. Unfortunately, try as it may, it can't completely rise above being just a sequel the way you feel it wants. And you can really feel it trying.",
            "If there's a funnier comedy sequel than 22 Jump Street, it probably didn't suggest the studio should market an at-home children's shooting game with phalluses as the targets. So, 22 Jump Street wins.",
            "You can almost hear Lord and Miller giggling to the audience \"can you believe they're actually paying us to do this?\" We can. And it's absolutely worth it. This is one refreshingly smart comedy.",
            "22 Jump Street is belly-aching, mickey-taking, cinema-shaking summer comedy at its very best.",
            "22 Jump Street is hugely successful in retaining -- and in many instances, improving upon -- the qualities of it predecessor and pitching some jokes that will still have people chuckling for days afterwards.",
            "Tatum and Hill share remarkably good chemistry and both fall back into their respective roles of lovable if slightly dim jock and self-conscious nerd with ease.",
            "Proving that sometimes a second helping is nearly as satisfying as the first, \"22 Jump Street\" doesn't stray far from the formula that made \"21 Jump Street\" a success -- and takes pride in providing more of the same.",
            "Yes, there are other characters involved; but the nicest thing I can say about them is that they were forgettable.",
            "There's a slightly wearing tyranny in the film's insatiable, gurning desire to be congratulated on its postmodern 'cleverness' at nearly every stage of its duration.",
            "22 Jump Street transcends the expectations of the Hollywood sequel by picking it apart bit by bit and then reassembling it into something new but familiar.",
            "22 Jump Street has an infectious pair of less-than-stellar cops and when Hill and Tatum are onscreen together, the movie works.",
            "Conclusive proof that Phil Lord and Chris Miller are two of the best comedy directors working today.",
            "There's much to love in this well-made film, there's plenty of talent and zing and love for the project. It's also a good movie and blockbuster bait. Its layered gags are genius and the stars are summer magic.",
            "About once a year, a film bursts out of nowhere that's simply the funniest thing since the last funniest film of the summer. This one is a sharp, smart and hilarious frat comedy that's everything Bad Neighbours should have been, but wasn't.",
            "Go for a load of laughs and stay for the end credits.",
            "There are enough hits to keep you smiling, and the action scenes required to liven things up. Returning fans won't be disappointed."

            "After the arrest, the storytelling becomes more grim but Stewart never loses his sense of satire.",

            "Humour of the most absurdist kind does find its way into the film. ",
            "The interrogations become repetitive: it is hard to maintain suspense when the outcome is known and the end comes abruptly.",

            "In typical (Jon) Stewart fashion ROSEWATER turns controversial political events into boisterous humor.",
            "The overriding message of the film is the need for free press--a somewhat academic end to a very human experience. That, combined with the obvious lack of suspense, make for an interesting, if lukewarm, film.",
            "Stewart seems to be declaring on every frame of Rosewater, but his knack for dealing with dry subject matter in all kinds of hilarious ways would have worked wonders. It's almost cruel how he turns the film into such a humorless bore.",
            "Stewart's comic genius fails to translate into film excellence in his first attempt as a writer and director.",
            "On the whole Rosewater is an auspicious debut, but I suspect it has taught Stewart that when it comes to movies, as opposed to journalism, a little blatant emotional manipulation is no bad thing.",
            "Competently crafted but seldom more than that, Rosewater shows that Stewart could probably make a living as a filmmaker if he so chose. But for now, I hope he keeps his daily-sorry, his day job.",

            "Rosewater, scripted and directed by Jon Stewart, is a work of skill as well as passion",
            "When it ventures into the more abstract territory of its tortured protagonist's mind, the film is able to show how comedians can be unlikely heroes for serious causes, and how humour and imagination can survive the worst totalitarian attacks.",
            "If anyone questioned that a late-night host of a fake news show could make a compelling political drama, viewing Rosewater should put those doubts to rest.",
            "The story is good, and Stewart lays it out engagingly, with a sharp eye for pacing and a light touch on the diplomatic complexities involved.",

            "Take one teenager. Add raw testosterone. Arm with unquenchable, unreasoning anger. Lock in pressure-cooker cell. Unleash. Roll camera.",
            "[An] unusually cohesive and exciting prison drama ...",
            "\"Starred Up\" manages to be sympathetic, not only because of O'Connell's galvanizing turn, but also Asser and director David Mackenzie's unwavering commitment to portraying his character with as much compassion as brutal honesty.",
            "It's almost as difficult to sit through \"Starred Up\" as it is satisfying to watch it.",
            "What I love about Starred Up is it's almost devoid of sentimentality. Any that there is doused in a heavy dose of realism.",
            "A provocative if downbeat film that will likely grip you from its opening scenes to the end.",
            "Despite its use of tried-and-tested tropes, David Mackenzie has made something that feels incredibly refreshing and relevant. ",
            "Comes armed with a fine cast, topical subject matter and just enough subversion of a well-worn genre stable to please those exhausted by mindless gangster slash 'em ups.",
            "The authentic script is supported by incredibly strong acting that genuinely captures the multifaceted experiences of growing up in the system.",
            "Anyone not already aboard the bandwagon should make a beeline for this uncompromising prison drama, in which O'Connell plays a problematic teen doing his first extended stint in the slammer.",
            "O'Connell gives a steaming and screaming performance as Eric, a broken young man who has spent his life being slammed by his father.",
            "Jack O'Connell and Ben Mendelsohn are outstanding as the prison hardmen who just happen to be father and son.",
            "A no-holds barred, explicit exploration of prison culture.",
            "O'Connell's physicality as an actor--coiled intensity, searing stares, brooding fury, sudden violence--is blazingly showcased here. And it always feels as if we're caught up in among resentments, flare-ups, even long-running relationships of convenience.",
            "A great ripple effect is felt throughout David Mackenzie's Starred Up, a gritty British prison drama that puts most gritty prison dramas to shame.",
            "The intention seems to be to create a ferocious film without an iota of fakery...",
            "harsh, real, remarkably well-acted, and obviously personal",
            "Starred Up is unflinchingly ferocious and you won't be able to look away.",
            "The violence is brutal but never exploitative, and the rendering of hard-core prison life is heartbreaking without feeling totally hopeless.",
            "Gritty, intense, unflinching and taut. An emotional punch to the gut. Jack O'Connell delivers a bravura, star-making performance. It's the best prison drama since A Prophet. ",
            "The power of this movie is in its lack of interest in the dramatic and its preference, instead, of the humane.",
            "Mackenzie supports his screenwriter's humanitarian intentions by bringing out his actors' best, so it's forgivable that Starred Up is shaped less like a drama than an intense therapy session."

            "Love at First Fight is overflowing with relentlessly acerbic humor that shapes the way the film's two young protagonists contend with not just each other, but also with the uncertainties of the world they're emerging into as adults.",
            "Aggression, not affection, sparks romance in Les Combattants, a promising feature debut that already had members of the French film establishment touting newcomer Thomas Cailley as the next big thing.",
            "[The film] doesn't live up to its promise... [but] it's an intriguingly off-kilter relationship drama and the two leads are persuasive.",
            "The eerie emptiness of the northern countryside, evacuated after a forest fire, is a little like that evoked by Bruno Dumont. Cailley is a talent to watch.",

            "Director Thomas Cailley conjures up a vivid, unusual world, offering a playful reversal of usual gender roles.",
            "Thomas Cailley's debut is more than admirable: he achieves something simple from something complicated, offering a story with many layers and reflections about youth. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "The debut feature for its young writer-director, this unassuming but engaging French dramedy deserves the prizes it picked up at Cannes and at the country's Oscar-equivalent Cesars.",
            "Irritably charming, Love at First Fight is a warm summer romance destined to be remade by Hollywood. ",
            "Les Combattants is diverting enough, but it is not exceptional.",
            "Crowd-pleasing without compromising on its uniqueness, the result has romcom structure but a beguiling adventure mood reminiscent of the best US indies.",
            "Thomas Cailley's Love at First Fight is a French romantic comedy that's a good thing for a change, instead feeling more like a charming YA novel.",
            "The dramatic final act is audacious, yet wholly in keeping with the film's bubbling themes of love and war.",
            "The leads are splendid, with Aza\u00efs's genial vacancy and Haenel's deadpan gravity persuading viewers that they could be a genuine couple.",
            "The bright, footloose cinematography keeps our interest piqued by replicating Artaud's sensuous wonder at the world around him. But Les combattants would be half the film it is without the busy-bee score by the electro trio Hit'n'Run.",
            "A sensitive, slight French romance that marks a promising debut from French filmmaker Cailley.",
            "It's undeniably on the slight side but this is an endearingly scrappy film with a fighter's spunk and a lover's heart that doesn't surrender to sentimentality.",
            "There's a better movie floating around the edges of the French import \"Love at First Fight\" than first-time feature director Thomas Cailley has allowed to surface.",
            "All in all, this film is refreshingly original, an existential, boy-meets-survivalist romantic comedy.",
            "What starts out as a promisingly unique tale of a macho woman and the meek guy who falls for her turns into something else once Madeleine leaves for training camp and Arnaud follows.",
            "This debut feature by French writer-director Thomas Cailley is the rare romantic comedy that's satisfying as genre entertainment but also inspires serious thought on pertinent social issues.",
            "For a movie about bodily endurance and rugged adventure, Cailley's direction is oddly detached-he lets the script (which he co-wrote with Claude Le Pape) suggest the tough work and hardly bothers to film it.",
            "Cailley smartly keeps the focus on his characters, allowing both of his young actors to shine.",
            "What matters in a movie like this is the relationship. Cailley understands that, and keeps his approach simple and transparent."

            "What initially appears to be a case of art imitating art soon begins to feel like an economic and tawdry imitation. ",
            "[Life of Riley] is a film adaptation of the play by Alan Ayckbourn that is bereft of laughs or joy and just tries too hard.",
            "... a pleasant frivolity, a mix of bedroom farce (without the bedrooms), romantic comedy, and self-aware theater that opens on the first day of rehearsals and ends after closing night.",
            "A funny, energetic, comic-book-influenced film marked by saturated colors, theatrical sets, and middle-aged people acting like the lovelorn leads favored by Eric Rohmer.",
            "While it may be too mannered for mainstream audiences, the film is also a knowing exploration of human interaction",
            "Ayckbourn's quintessentially British tale of death and infidelity in rural Yorkshire translates surprisingly well into Resnais' auteurist form, making for a delightful postmodern experiment in the intertextuality of art.",
            "It's the end of a filmmaking career of over 60 years, perhaps not the last word he would have chosen... but a pleasant variation on a theme in a rich career",
            "While this may not be Resnais' finest work, it's a worthy final offering to mark what has been a truly illustrious career.",
            "It's Resnais's genius for making complex formal experimentation seem mischievously accessible that makes this so enjoyable. He will be much missed, but leaves a matchless legacy.",
            "A final opportunity to see a master at work in this mischievously melancholic delight.",
            "There is such tender conviction in the performances and such easy assurance in the flowing camerawork and editing that you are obliged to concentrate even more fully on the substance rather than the style.",
            "...if you go for clever contrivances, you may love it, but if your taste runs runs toward more straightforward storytelling, you'll probably want to run screaming from the auditorium.",
            "Delightful, fanciful comedy is given much added life by performances from a strong cast, pungent dialogue and inspired production design.",
            "Where the director's early work was haunted by the Holocaust, the atomic bomb and the Algerian war, Life of Riley blithely celebrates love, possibility and absurdist surprises.",

            "The film has a cinematic ambition to which it admirably lives up, not only in its bold structure and impressively moody cinematography, production, editing and sound design, but also in its plethora of imaginative and unconventional touches.",
            "Nick Cave says he isn't interested in things that he understands. Yet this distillation of the man himself -- reflective and sensitive, and inventive -- tells you much about an artist's understanding of his art.",

            "Fittingly enlightening, \"Awake: The Life of Yogananda\" is a vivid, elegantly assembled portrait of the savvy guru with the cherubic face and penetrating gaze who brought meditation to the West.",
            "A film that works both for followers and for those interested in knowing what yoga is truly about. Hint: It's not about six-pack abs.",
            "The film's storytelling is straightforward, almost standard-issue, but the story itself is compelling, as is the testimony of devotees."

            "Unexpectedly dazzling.",
            "Tim's Vermeer is film as forensics, bringing math and science to bear to solve an art-world mystery.",

            "Mostly it is fascinating and compelling.",
            "Tim's Vermeer is, just that, Tim Jenison's \"Vermeer.\" In fact, the movie is not about Vermeer. It is about Tim Jenison-a fascinating and unusual subject...",
            "The film is a fascinating inquiry, but over time it becomes even more intriguing as a Herzog-like portrait of one man's crazy obsession, and just how far he will go to fulfill it.",
            "While the filmmakers were clearly going for a more lighthearted tone at times, it often seems at odds with what's actually going on.",
            "Despite Jenison's soft-spoken nature and Teller's unadorned style, the film is wildly entertaining and thought-provoking, and it awakens a giddy, childlike sense of discovery and curiosity few films manage to capture. ",
            "Tim's Vermeer shares similarities with other recent art-mystery docs like Who The #$&% Is Jackson Pollock and My Kid Could Paint That, both of which dare to question the perceived truths held dear by art world elites.",
            "Every bit the magic trick that Penn & Teller are known for conjuring, except in seeing Tim apply one precise brushstroke after another, there's no question as to how it's done, though there still remains a great deal of wonder. ",
            "As a portrait of one man's all-consuming persistence alone, it's astonishing.",
            "[Tim] Jenison's perseverance and singular vision keep the film engaging.",
            "But the doc is worth a look for Jenison himself-a calm, engaging presence whose success you root for-and for its back half, which shows the process he goes through to recreate the setting of Vermeer's The Music Lesson.",
            "Tim's Vermeer refers not just to the replica Vermeer he seeks to paint, but to his understanding of who Vermeer was and how he accomplished his work. ",
            "Perhaps the ultimate take-away from Tim's Vermeer is the unquenchable curiosity of certain people, albeit those with the money to finance that inquisitiveness, to get to the bottom of history's mysteries. In that respect, Jenison is an artist.",
            "The lengths to which Jenison goes to ensure he is working with the same tools, limitations and liberties that were available to Vermeer are nothing short of gobsmacking.",
            "What it turns out to actually be about is Tim Jenison, and what it means to be a member of the new (techno) rich in the United States of the 21st Century.",
            "Tim's Vermeer is both enjoyable as entertainment and as an intelligently mounted case study of how art and technology complement, rather than grind against, each other. As Penn eloquently puts it: \"The problem is we make that distinction.\"",
            "A lively, intriguing look at the line between artist and inventor, one that challenges the very notion that the distinction should be made at all.",
            "A masterpiece of documentary filmmaking",
            "I can easily say that this film is more engaging than any action film I've seen of late, which is quite a remarkable achievement.",

            "Black Souls is the sort of authentically gritty Italian gangster film that does well at film festivals but is too challenging for commercial audiences here.",

            "In a certain kind of Italian mob picture, you expect blood feuds, family feasts, and generational conflict. Certainly Francesco Munzi's adaptation of a popular crime novel has all that, but it's more family drama than shoot-'em-up. ",
            "This is a dynastic tale that gets more claustrophobic as it develops, as its web of vendetta-style recriminations closes in on the Carbone clan, goat farmers who have diversified into riskier and more profitable businesses.",
            "The focus moves fluidly around the key players, enriching the story, while the action is unflashy but precision-staged.",

            "A brooding & haunting look at how violence submerges men into a never ending darkness.",

            "Just when you think there's no fresh blood to be found in the mob film along comes Black Souls from Italy to prove you wrong.",
            "Black Souls, a crime melodrama from Italy in the official festival competition, is a dark journey indeed -- but it does open with one corker of a gag.",
            "The tone is pseudo-Sopranos at times, but the oppressive ambience is grippingly sustained.",

            "That the film's only exuberant display of cinematic prowess is reserved for an extended 30-minute sequence of God raining His wrath down on the ruling class won't be lost on viewers in the year 2014, which has seen so much racial injustice...",
            "Ridley Scott may be 77, but he's making films with the energy and ambition of a man half his age.",
            "Ir\u00f3nicamente, la ola de muerte levantada por las diez plagas le da algo de vida a la pel\u00edcula, pero es algo meramente visual como ver el agua transformarse en sangre o a una manada de cocodrilos comerse entre s\u00ed.",

            "The convincing atmosphere, performances and soundtrack of vintage Yank R&B obscurities make this an enjoyable throwback to a scene whose influence if not its fame eventually traveled far.",
            "This project was clearly a labor of love for Constantine, but it is hard not to conclude that her original documentary idea might have had a lot more passion than this flat-footed fictional treatment.",

            "The world doesn't need another empty genre exercise. But as Blue Ruin reminds us, it can always use more filmmakers of Saulnier's resourcefulness, sensitivity and quiet assurance.",
            "With the same brand of realist irony the Coens used to cool down Blood Simple, writer-director Jeremy Saulnier slows the genre's heartbeat to gripping effect.",
            "Blue Ruin starts promisingly with a hairy hobo living in a blue, rusty, bullet-holed Pontiac on a Delaware beach.",
            "Saulnier is also a cinematographer, and he's in complete control of the film's conflation of human-scale horror and tragicomedy.",
            "Blair, an unheralded actor, carries the whole picture. He's in practically every scene, and his performance is fascinating because in his eyes you can see the character struggling desperately with himself.",
            "Saulnier makes impressive use of silence and slow camera movements, allowing the suspense to simmer until violence seems practically inevitable.",
            "Blue Ruin is not a truly organic story in terms of originality, but its brutal take on revenge and [Macon] Blair's mesmerising performance makes it one of the year's best films that no-one will have heard of.",
            "For all its chilling realism, Blue Ruin collapses as it tries to fight against the inevitability of its genre and its inability to rise above that predestined path.",
            "Rather than give away its sparse elements, I'd rather tell you it's beautifully paced, and filled with foreboding; Blue Ruin is a testament to the effectiveness of great acting and direction.",
            "Blue Ruin is a great low-budget thriller with an original voice and strong, realistic performances.",
            "Despite a plot hole in the otherwise well-plotted and enticing thriller, it's an ace calling card for its director and lead actor.",
            "Saulnier has created a very brutal, raw image of the revenge thriller. He takes it out of the ridiculousness of Hollywood and how big budget films treat the sub-genre.",
            "It is a straightforward, stark, no-frills story, which Saulnier's script tells with no extraneous sub-plots or characters padding the narrative.",
            "Blue Ruin marks Jeremy Saulnier out as an exciting filmmaker to watch - it's just a shame that the film can't fully shake off the weight of its influences.",
            "A well-paced, well written, and surprisingly poignant film.",
            "It's a dark film, with a sicko sense of humor, that's not for all tastes. But the talented director knows how to keep things tense, taut and exciting.",
            "Jeremy Saulnier's \"Blue Ruin\" is a small, quiet film brimming with smart directorial decisions.",
            "Even though at some points it hints at dark humor in a Coen brothers kinda way, this movie is far from making you laugh. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Every shot in this film is carefully selected to bring the most out of this thrilling story. [Full review in Spanish] ",
            "An umpredictable journey that manages to build up tension and interest the whole time. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Brilliant stroke to have a nebbish carrying out a one-man vendetta against a gang of bad guys rather than a Charles Bronson retread.",
            "A lean piece of thriller filmmaking with a potent human core.",
            "Exponentially inspirational; Blue Ruin is a film that feels like intimate atomic fallout out from an event that radiates through the lives of two families. Filmmaker Jeremy Saulnier is irrevocably one to watch. ",
            "It gets uglier. And as it does, the lessons become more apparent to you, if not to Dwight."

            "Gia Coppola's debut about the teen experience has a lyricism that transcends James Franco's mediocre source.",
            "A pale imitation of the early novels of Bret Easton Ellis, who wrote about young ennui and aimlessness from the inside out. ",

            "Disaffected, wealthy young people aren't new subjects for a film, but perhaps because [Gia] Coppola is not far from the age (and background) of her characters some of the details resonate. ",
            "A meandering contemplation on teen angst but with nothing new or interesting to say about it.",
            "I know plenty of filmmakers tend to make the same movie over and over again, but when you're making the movie of another famous relative, I would think you'd feel silly.",
            "A lackluster and slow-going film where its stories don't pan out well.",
            "While not quite at the level of Richard Linklater's Dazed and Confused or Olivier Assayas' Cold Water, it comes closer than most contemporary American teen films dare.",
            "Coppola's film is about what she knows; she's obviously more ambitious than her apathetic and self-obsessed characters, but she probably knows a few of them. Far from perfect, but a solid beginning.",
            "While all the young actors are committed to their characters (though none of them particularly stand out), this film will likely drown in its own nothingness as far more thought-provoking teenage fare continues to prevail.",
            "Just because the kids can't make sense of their acting out doesn't mean the film shouldn't try to.",
            "The real headline is Coppola herself, though. I may not love Palo Alto but its substance and style are singular enough that I am keen to see what she does next.",

            "People are just like birds, this French drama asserts-over and over again, with mind-numbing obviousness, until you might feel like spreading your wings and flying away yourself. ",
            " An airport hotel may not seem the most inspiring of locations for a story of life-changing consequence, but French filmmaker Pascale Ferran's delicate, compassionate \"Bird People\" is just that sort of risk-taking existential adventure.",
            "The vehicle for the message feels haphazard, as if Ferran were trying to create a patchwork of various film types rather than one cohesive piece.",
            "Bird People has ideas about nature, human and otherwise. It's got a sense of romantic wonder.",
            "An artful experiment that only half works.",
            "Ferran is prone to \"flights of fancy,\" pardon the pun, as some scenes in his film go on unchecked while others aren't allowed nearly the right amount of time to develop.",
            "Through such a bold stroke of originality, Bird People highlights the boundless opportunities makes available through storytelling.",
            "Did you know there's a sparrow sitting just outside your window? Probably not -- they're so common that they are practically invisible. That's what the movie Bird People is getting at, in its own charming and humorous way.",
            "Bird People is one of those rare opportunities to see something different and exceptional. [full review in Spanish]",
            "The premise sounds interesting, but it suffers from a lack of cohesiveness. [full review in Spanish]",
            "The characters are not engaging enough and the film ends up being boring. [full in review in Spanish]",
            "A very subtle and smooth film. Basically a European version of Lost In Translation. [full review in Spanish]",
            "An incomplete puzzle made out of different ideas that never really fit with each other. [full review in Spanish]",
            "A low-key charming diptych character piece that was also divisive, at least according to the chatter in the lines at Cannes.",
            "A few tweaks in tone and it could have been profound. Instead it lingers in the realm of the intriguing.",
            "Potential narratives, other characters, other lives, could connect through Ferran's film, that's in the air, but will Gary and Audrey? Details, details. ",
            "...[a] glittering little oddity.",
            "A slow build opens into flights of fancy.",
            "...a strange and sometimes discomfiting movie that occasionally gets a little heavy-handed as it traces the trajectories of two disrupted souls through the depressingly neutral territory of an airport hotel. ",
            "There are different kinds of bird people in Pascale Ferran's winsome romantic drama, some more worth watching than others.",
            "A textbook example of ambition undercut by tonal and pacing inconsistency. ",
            "The special effects were assembled with painstaking details ... These dreamlike elements look organic and charming, and are the best part of the film.",
            "At the risk of taking the avian symbolism a step too far, I'd wager that telegraphing one's intentions to interrogate the realities of 21st-century dislocation only to settle for hands-across-the-water truisms seems a little chicken.",
            "When, at last, Ferran switches her attention fully to Demoustier's character, Bird People finally takes off. It's a moment worth waiting for -- and once it's happened, the movie does not let you down again."

            "An empty, efficient thriller that leaves you as cold as most of its characters.",

            "The \"Saw\" formula of a mysterious voice guiding our hero through a series of depravities has gone a bit stale.",
            "Stamm brings such a deft touch to these tonal transitions that it's hard to believe he directed the dreadful 2010 hit The Last Exorcism.",
            "13 Sins is perversely entertaining enough to keep hold interest, sporting a rather grungy, crumbly New Orleans in Zoltan Honti's cinematography. ",
            "I wouldn't say this movie was scary but it had a lot of dark humor and was incredibly entertaining. ",

            "Not surprisingly, the last challenge is the most difficult of all.",
            "Flimsy plot withstanding, 13 Sins is an enjoyable watch and fits neatly into the ever expanding genre of film as theme park ride: thrilling, shocking, forgettable.",
            "It's a challenging genre to take on - one in which it's difficult to deliver surprises or present complex characters - but Stamm has acquitted himself well.",
            "13 Sins isn't perfect but will certainly keep you hooked until the bloody denouement.",
            "13 Sins is a tense and thrilling rollercoaster that grabs you just a few minutes in and doesn't let go until its done taking you through its bizarre trip.",
            "Director Daniel Stamm manages one memorable set piece, involving a motorcycle gang and a clothes line.",
            "The overall effect is enormously amusing. And haunting as well.",
            "The material is fairly B-level, and Stamm is pretty blessed to have Webber and Perlman to keep it from falling down a tier.",
            "Even if the premise is tired, this grim thriller holds the attention by focussing on the raw intensity of the characters' personal lives.",
            "Puts the audience in the position to question what they'd be willing to do, and I think many of us would be shocked at which level our friends might bow out of this game.",
            "...this is one of those mind games that lean too heavily on the mindless to be thoroughly enjoyable, turning sadistic pleasure into harmless boredom.",
            "The structure is familiar and the tension is lacking.",
            "An unrepentant horror-thriller, stoked with tension and grim revelations."

            "With Ebert's blessing and encouragement, Life Itself is a warts-and-all look at how the son of an Illinois electrician and housewife became a prolific writer who spent 46 years as the film critic at the Chicago Sun Times.",
            "What comes through most in Life Itself, a film named after Ebert's 2011 memoir, is his great, open-minded vigor.",
            "If you aren't moved by Life Itself, you ought to have your heart examined.",
            "The film's core is footage shot during the last four months of Ebert's life, when he had lost most of his jaw and was unable to eat or speak. It's hard to see him in this state, which makes his frequent cheerfulness and humor all the more remarkable.",
            "It's undercooked (we're not even told what movies he loved as a child) and a clip of the great New Yorker critic Pauline Kael speaking made me sit bolt upright thinking \"Now you're talking.\"",
            "A film about a movie critic might not sound an attractive proposition, but Steve James's biographical documentary on Pulitzer Prize-winning, Chicago Sun-Times journalist Roger Ebert (who died last year) is deeply moving.",
            "Life Itself is a reminder, I suppose, that when the human spirit lives on we never really lose our voice. ",
            "A heartfelt exploration of a man who opened film up for the world. ",
            "Life Itself is not a film of mourning, it is a film of celebration. It is not a lionization, it is an exploration. But most importantly I think it is a film that Roger would be proud of. ",
            "I loved this movie... partly because I loved Roger.",
            "[Roger Ebert's] determination is heart-wrenching... The great difficulty for James is in reconciling these powerful sequences with the more traditional elements of a narrative documentary.",
            "ife Itself left me inspired, as I'm sure it did every single person in the theater.",
            "My only complaint about the expansive, emotional documentary \"Life Itself,\" about legendary film critic Roger Ebert, is that you really can't complain about it. ",
            "A celebration of the life of the most important film critic of the past 50 years, a man of the people as well as a film connoisseur. ",
            "...a revelation, an approach to the life of a fascinating man we only knew through his work. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "While Life Itself falls more into the category of \"posthumous celebration\" than \"in-depth documentary,\" it does an excellent job of painting a visual portrait of a man who was often polarizing, yet almost universally admired. ",
            "In [Steve] James' affectionate telling, Ebert's life, itself, was bountiful indeed.",
            "Life Itself is the kind of film that reminds you why you love the movies.",
            "This is an extraordinary biopic not just because it is about an extraordinary life but because it advocates living - and dying - with candor and grace.",
            "Roger Ebert was an unusual outlier in the world of critics, and Life Itself is an honorable testament to how he shaped the world of cinema as we know it today.",
            "No film in the festival is as critic-friendly; watching it, I finally understood how football players must feel about 'Brian's Song'.",
            "[A] succinct and often hilarious retelling of a life well lived.",
            "Well, Roger, you made it. You're in a movie.",
            "My generation will never know a film critic like Roger Ebert again. He brought his noble trade to the people and made us all film critics by celebrating his love of movies at a level we could all understand. "

            "Neither Alex Murphy's internal moral conflict nor the larger, vaguely satiric portrait of a global culture dependent on high-tech law enforcement seem to be the main point of this Robocop remake, which raises the question of what is meant to be the point.",

            "RoboCop wants to be about big ideas like identity, the nature of self, man vss technology, security versus freedom, corporate greed that puts profits over people, and all manner of lofty themes. Only the film never actually explores any of them.",
            "Unfortunately, like a lot of the ideas, they never really capitalized on it and the idea was ultimately just forced into a simple plot device to move things along.",

            "[An] engaging, low-key character study.",
            "As a performance showcase it's intriguing simply because Eenhoorn and Nelson barely belong to the same species, so different are they in demeanor.",

            "Amazing that they made so much out of so little. Nelson relentlessly pumps out the comedy, and Eenhoorn convincingly counters this bombardment and brings a much-needed splash of sunlight to the film's end.",
            "The breakout star here is Nelson, who practically forces a smile on your face at regular intervals.",
            "Land Ho!'s success is found in its small observations and flawless, off-beat leads.",
            "Stephens and Katz basically rely on the immense screen charisma of their two principals, which largely bails them out.",
            "Unassuming and amiable, this road-trip buddy comedy... belongs squarely in the sub-genre of very-low-budget American indies with untrained actors and improvised dialogue that has been dubbed mumblecore.",
            "In their 60s and on the road",
            "\"Land Ho!\" is a high-spirited and life-affirming film about drinking life down to the last drop. \"Don't get that Sunday afternoon attitude,\" Mitch admonishes Colin near the end of the trip. \"It ain't over with yet.\" ",
            "...no huge emotional payoff here (the film's shambling nature reminds me of the Dutch documentary Ne me quite pas, about two aging working-class alcoholics), just an hour and a half of pleasant company.",
            "Land Ho! feels like the perfect combination of scripted dialogue and off-the-cuff improvisation.",
            "The scenery is gorgeous, the mood is upbeat and your traveling companions are interesting fellows.",
            "The scenery is lovely, the performances are pleasant, and it's the kind of movie it's hard to imagine anyone walking out of. It's nice. Yeah: It's nice.",
            "Land Ho! delights because it isn't trying to make too much of itself. It's simply a fun movie about two guys who will admit they're getting older, but are damn sure not getting old.",
            "The results are an amiable, somewhat rambling film that's certainly not going to change your life but does provide a pleasing 95 minutes at the movies.",
            "Nothing much happens in Land Ho!, which is sometimes charming and sometimes frustrating.",
            "Earl Lynn Nelson is a force of nature as Mitch, a loud, boisterous scene-stealer who breathes comic life into this otherwise low-key road-trip dramedy.",
            "One of my favorite films so far this year.",
            "A middling, mildly funny slice of senior-citizen life that thrives on its stars, and lags on its accoutrements.",

            "Wise, who is noticeably older than the 29-year-old Ruskin was at the time the events occurred in real life, gives a tense, implacable performance, and Fanning is touching. The movie, however, directed by Richard Laxton, could use a lot more oomph.",
            "\"Effie Gray\" runs 108 minutes, yet it feels like it ends right before the real drama is about to begin.",
            "With a script by Emma Thompson, you might expect Effie Gray to have the same period-piece poignancy as her 1995 take on Sense and Sensibility. No such luck.",
            "A beautifully crafted film filled with a haunting stillness and melancholy touched with moments of humor... Effie Gray speaks to the heart and pays soft homage to the woman whose life we see unfold.",

            "Due to Laxton and Thompson's dirge-like approach, their cinematic retelling of the true events does nothing but make you feel lousy and ready for a nap.",

            "Somehow more inspiring than disappointing, this account of Alejandro Jodorowsky's doomed effort to bring Dune to the big screen still manages to be a testament to artistic insanity and tenacity."

            "It's a risky approach that's bound to frustrate many folks, but it's also quite illuminating in its own way.",
            "All is By My Side is wholly worth it for the engaging and moving performances from Benjamin and Poots.",
            "The filmmakers didn't have the rights to any of the Hendrix compositions, but that doesn't matter as much as you'd expect. Taking the non-Hollywood high road, Ridley succeeds in capturing the artist's fluid rhythms, laconic style, and cosmic view...",
            "The film rides on a strong performance by Andr\u00e9 Benjamin of Outkast fame, who has the vocal mannerisms and movement of the guitar legend down to a fine art. However, the script fails to give Hendrix any real dramatic dimension...",
            "The greatest disappointment here is that whilst Benjamin totally embodies the spirit of Hendrix... the performance he gives is far greater than the story it's contained within.",

            "Andr\u00e9 Benjamin does a fair job of conveying Hendrix's languid charisma and grace... But the soapy drama remains about as convincing as the troop of rock lookalikes who file past at intervals.",
            "Andre 3000 makes an A-grade Hendrix, but this biopic sees the legend's legacy fall into a bit of a haze.",
            "The woozy soundtrack and jump-cut visuals add a touch of period hallucinogenics, but the intimate detail never rings true.",
            "Unfortunately, for all Benjamin's fine work All is By My Side is one long string of such cliches and counts as a major disappointment.",
            "Jimi: All Is by My Side takes an approach that more musician biopics should... honing in on one specific period of Hendrix's life instead of providing a rushed tour.",
            "A surprisingly thoughtful meditation on the key year that transformed guitarist Jimi Hendrix (played by OutKast's Andr\u00e9 Benjamin) from session player to superstar.",
            "Imagine a film portrait of Jimi Hendrix without the drugs that killed him at 27 and the rock that would make him immortal.",
            "Benjamin looks the part, but his stilted performance is pure Razzie-bait, plus he's 39.",

            "The music sounds fine, but Macy's iffy direction prevents Rudderless from becoming more than a quasi-pleasing, mediocre first effort from a filmmaker struggling to set sail on a firm course."

            "An absorbing portrait of a woman, Gregg Araki continues to play exquisite corpse with film form.",
            "Is this a coming-of-age story or a whodunit? This heightened, luxurious melodrama...makes you wonder if the two genres are quite as different as you first thought.",
            "\"A melodrama about numbness and detachment, writer-director Gregg Araki's adaptation of Laura Kasischke's novel is a paradox on paper and an anesthetized dud on screen.\"",
            "Green in particular seems to be channeling the bride of Frankenstein for half her scenes. It's an awkward mix of styles, and it doesn't work.",
            "White Bird in a Blizzard makes full use of its all-star cast, driving a performance-led drama through a somewhat lacklustre adaptation.",
            "It's an enjoyably arch turn from Green, but one that seems to occupy a different stratosphere to her co-stars who play things with a decided naturalism. ",
            "A film that could have been so much more considering its interesting resources, and stayed behind the shadow of its main star's performance. [Full review in Spanish].",
            "If the director intended to elicit truths about the terrors of marriage, or the difficulties of a mother-daughter relationship, he has failed comprehensively.",
            "Rising star Woodley is adding some raunchiness to her image; but her failure to make foul-mouthed, overly sex-obsessed Kat particularly likeable is symptomatic of the film's own weakness for posture over substance.",
            "No Gregg Araki film is a waste of time, and White Bird in a Blizzard is no exception. ",
            "Events are ultimately spelled out in a way that betrays a novel one would have thought was not good enough to be betrayed.",
            "Kudos to Woodley -- star of a major film franchise, the young-adult dystopian The Divergent Series -- for taking on more unusual projects.",
            "Araki's latest drama is a refreshingly frank coming-of-age story, featuring another great performance from Woodley.",
            "Woodley reminds us that she's not just the hippie queen of YA adaptations, but a bracing actress who's not averse to taking some gutty risks.",
            "It's Woodley who steals the show with her underplayed and heartbreaking performance as a girl suddenly bereft of her overbearing mother.",
            "A misguided personal trip that rambles confusedly between drama and mystery, without guaranteeing genuine interest. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "A very recomendable film based on the novel writen by Laura Kasischke. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "This movie slowly changes genre into film noir, with two great femme fatale's. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Araki's style is all over the film and the ending is trademark, but the film ends up being a dissappointment. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Araki never digs deep enough, wasting the opportunity to expose Kat's resentments.",
            "This should be a profound character study, but the cliched use of flashbacks and the mawkish elements to the piece detract heavily from our own enjoyment.",
            "This dreamy/nightmarish weirdie finds Araki reining in his anarchic excesses with rewarding results, as his satirical sensuality reaps the benefits of a heavily orchestrated deadpan formality."

            "[Evans] carries Untold by admirably fulfilling the two essential functions of a period-movie hero: to enunciate comic-book dialogue with Shakespearean authority and to look great with his shirt off.",
            "Most of the time, I found myself feeling like I was waiting for a turn with the gaming controls.",
            "If you can selectively ignore this litany of inanity, you may find some substantial earthy pleasures in \"Dracula Untold.\"",
            "The idea is to humanize one of the most fearful monsters in the Western crypt. But Dracula Untold goes way overboard, past domestication and into canonization.",
            "A generic vampire tale in the Underworld vein that comes closer to the infamous Van Helsing than a memorable re-interpretation of a legendary monster.",
            "The movie is the latest multiplex filler to co-opt a classic tale only to drown it in computer-generated murk. Even the title has the ring of something created by committee.",
            "For any one who wants to just have a fun time watching a vampire movie without being either bored or scared I strongly recommend this title for you.",
            "Even though this is a silly and absurd retelling of the popular legend, you know what else it is? It's also a lot of fun.",
            "I love a good antihero as much as the next critic, but Dracula's just not hero material. Even when he's awkwardly crammed into a heroic role, he doesn't behave heroically. He behaves like Vlad The Impaler, and we're supposed to cheer his brutality.",
            "An origin story that is fresh in ideology, painting a different and previously unseen picture of Vlad, a very human portrait of a man forced to face his own mortality and humanity out of love, leading him to his ultimate destiny.",
            "Neither Luke Evans nor his action star physique has the prowess to make Dracula Untold anything more than a series of pretty but empty headed action sequences. ",
            "Like a mix between Braveheart and a literal bat-man, Transylvania's favorite son has been reformatted and given a plot full of the worst moments from The Lord of the Rings series. ",
            "The film that has the potential to soar is thwarted by its saccharine moments and a lack of directorial confidence.",
            "Sometimes, what a film needs is a good script, and this proves that some stories are probably best left untold.",
            "Dracula Untold has a surprisingly soft bite -- succumbing to PG-13 level violence. It's a movie that clearly allowed the film to expand to a larger audience, but it also takes away some of the suspense and menace.",
            "Dracula Untold has its flaws, but when it works, it soars like a flock of bats. ",
            "Dracula Untold tries to do something different with the character's mythology but buckles from trying to do too much in too little time.",
            "[Dracula Untold] gives us a nonsensical picture of a tortured hero, forced by nobility into his life of mutilation. Even with stellar performances, it is a story that was better off Untold.",
            "As long as you don't really associate Untold with any previous Dracula renditions or think about the history behind it, then it's a relatively fun and painless popcorn-munching storm. ",

            "It doesn't matter if the rumors of Universal wanting a cinematic universe based on their mythological horror monsters is true or not, this movie killed whatever chance that had of happening.",
            "It's the whole \"family man\" thing that makes this film such a strange ride.",
            "This is essentially Evans's vehicle. His version of Dracula is action-oriented rather than horrifying and creepy. And keeping that in mind, he manages, in most parts, to get his teeth into the substance of Count Dracula's legend convincingly enough."

            "Paints a true-life picture of ordinary people with human consciences defying their orders and the law to do the right thing when bureaucracy fails them.",

            "More than a fair consolation prize for not being able to attend the Biophilia tour itself.",

            "You can't help but be impressed by how much it represents a natural, even defensive evolutionary step on its creator's part."

            "It's a bit too restrained on all fronts, but the film's young leads are wonderful, the songs are catchy and clever (Belle & Sebastian fans will be thrilled), the cinematography is shimmery and sharp, and it's an all-around pleasurable experience.",

            "Too cute at times, but ultimately kind of charming.",

            "Although much of that archival footage is incredibly familiar after decades of exposure - the burning bras, the clever protest signs, the impassioned speeches, Gloria Steinem - it's the footage of the opposition that really shocks.",
            "The wealth of anecdotal material provides a fascinating perspective on how the movement intersected -- and sometimes clashed -- with other liberal crusades of the 60s.",
            "It's a bubbling cauldron of newfound freedom and energy coming to life, an inspiring reminder of what people of a like mind and heart can accomplish. \"She's Beautiful When She's Angry\" is a thing of beauty indeed.",
            "A superbly researched and edited documentary about the women's movement in the 1960s.",
            "Intermittently interesting and occasionally compelling history of the feminist movement's early days.",
            "Blistering, informative, and wildly entertaining. But the most jaw-dropping thing about the film is that it's somehow the very first of its kind; never before has the women's movement been the subject of a feature documentary. ",
            "She's Beautiful When She's Angry's portrait of \"This is what feminism looked like,\" seems lacking.",
            "It's a loving portrait of a powerful group of women who demanded a seat at the table for all of us.",
            "You couldn't ask for a more inclusive account of the women's liberation. ",
            "Directed, produced, and shot exclusively by women, She's Beautiful When She's Angry tells the story of the American feminist movement.",
            "This feature length documentary covers a lot of ground in a remarkably focused way and at a satisfying pace.",
            "The film is truly entertaining, thought-provoking, shocking, witty and sassy, managing to keep a sense of humour, whilst also keeping an honesty and sensitivity to the seriousness of the cause.",
            "Delving into the historic struggles of the Women's Movement of the last century. Where did the basic rights females young and old enjoy today come from, and what fierce social struggles in the 20th century made them possible, and still relevant today.",
            "An informative look at the early years of the women's movement in the U.S.",
            "Fascinating documentary about the feminist movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
            "The film becomes a tedious procession of laudable figures recalling a noble cause; then it gets mired in the dull factionalism of race, sexual orientation, and class within the movement.",
            "This survey of second-wave feminism has considerably more verve than your standard talking-heads doc, thanks mostly to its engaging front-line fighters, most of whom are still animated with the fire of smashing the patriarchy.",
            "At times, \"She's Beautiful When She's Angry\" seems like a checklist of all the things women had to fight for. But it's a long list, and one that still faces women today.",

            "Director Mary Dore isn't much of a dramatic storyteller in her documentary She's Beautiful When She's Angry, but she presents a straightforward report on the rise of American feminism so passionately that it achieves a sense of giddy triumph.",
            "In quietly letting the parallels stack up between then and now, She's Beautiful When She's Angry paints a stirring portrait of activism that changed the social order and an era that, in some ways, still too closely mirrors our own.",
            "Dore's film should be seen. Take your daughters. And your sons.",
            "Dore made the movie to counter the lack of films about the women's movement -- a fine idea, nicely realized."

            "An urgent yet strangely simple and humanistic doomsday scenario.",
            "The low-budget Australian apocalyptic drama has such a terrific start - an adrenaline rush of panic and dread as a huge asteroid colliding with the Earth sends a wall of fire around the planet. It's a shame the movie peters out about halfway through. ",
            "Incoherent and pointless as it is, These Final Hours moves with commendable swiftness.",
            "These Final Hours is easily my favourite Australian film in years.",
            "Phillips gives his all in a display that showcases a multitude of emotions, and they all are stellar in appearance - he's come a long way from Wolf Creek and is poised to make a huge mark in the business shortly...",
            "[The] film doesn't have any of the melancholy of its cousins; it's harsher and bleaker, as befits the Australian landscape. But it still manages to find the humanity in annihilation.",
            "These Final Hours is a dramatically thrilling addition to the pre-apocalypse genre - there's a simplicity to some of it, a predictability too, but it's as surefooted in its suspense and action beats as it is during its emotional ones.",
            "If you're bored with this movie, I honestly don't know how to help you.",
            "These Final Hours may be that rare beast -- a low budget Australian film that could satisfy a multiplex audience in search of an edge-of-the-seat thrill.",
            "A thrilling game of scruples.",
            "[A] gorgeously-shot Australian apocalyptic disaster movie that's part buddy comedy, part end of the world downer and packs just as much of a punch as its gorier bedfellows.",
            "[A] blistering and noteworthy 2003 Australian apocalyptic low-budget film. In short, These Final Hours were well spent minutes on the clock in watching this well-structured doomsday drama unfold with intriguing forethought.",
            "These Final Hours sets up a simple redemption tale and convincingly stages mass panic on the sunny streets of Perth.",
            "Zak Hilditch's breathless... thriller tears through orgies, mass suicides and murderous rampages to conclude on a scene as moving and terrifying as the climax of Melancholia.",
            "It's the old mawkish story of a selfish adult reformed by a child, but the apocalyptic background throws up some lurid and unpredictable scenes.",
            "In a strange way it makes a hopeful statement, arguing that redemption is still possible up until the very point we are engulfed in continent-buckling fireballs.",
            "Although the film lacks the bravura of Von Trier's Melancholia or the heart and humour of Don McKellar's Last Night, it does have a propulsive energy and a satisfying arc of redemption.",
            "The plot might suggest a large-scale epic, but These Final Hours emerges as an intimate film about the end of the world.",
            "It's grim but thought-provoking fare, which Hilditch handles with considerable skill.",
            "It's the end of the world. Finally, a legitimate reason for a man to experience emotion. We've seen this all before... except not quite so ridiculous.",
            "Hilditch's 'end of the world' effort is a movie that could well be a dark horse bet to be one of many people's favourite films of the year by the time that 2016 comes to a close."

            "One of cinema's Old Masters returns with this poetic and profound dissection of art and storytelling.",
            "...a stunning work...",
            "The lack of something unifying everything together thematically holds National Gallery back from becoming something truly excellent.",
            "There is no explanation for this documentary, no obvious goals, nor a narrator to guide us. We just watch and listen. Also, National Gallery is Wiseman's most beautiful documentary since La Danse,",
            "Some of the film's most fascinating moments pay tribute to the gallery's technical prowess and craftsmanship.",
            "Wiseman's fly-on-the-wall style is the perfect formal approach to cut through the surface of pretence that dominates any kind of major institution's vision of itself, and it is this fascination with institutions that has marked Wiseman's lengthy career. ",
            "Wiseman does what he does best: creates a holistic sense of a place as an organic habitat rather than a mere organization.",
            "As National Gallery/ will show, paintings can communicate many things to many different people, and this latest institution makes for a unique look at the role of art in public life. ",
            "National Gallery is a snooty version of those BBC fly-on-the -wall series such as Airport.",
            "The film upholds the belief that the commonalities of self-expression, storytelling, and insightful observation reverberate through time.",
            "We're used to documentaries having a pedagogical or activist itinerary, but Wiseman's have become fastidiously unpedantic -- his simple Terence-like interest in what other human beings do and how they do it is more than enough.",
            "This is a love letter to the National Gallery which beguiles like a visual tone poem.",
            "The first of many pleasant surprises in National Gallery... is the unobstructed view afforded to paintings that now seem almost unrecognisable without a pair of gangly, backpacked foreign exchange students locking lips in front of them.",

            "The more you know, the more you want to stampede to the museum to see these works in person.",

            "If a picture is worth a thousand words, then there are at least a million things worth talking about in National Gallery.",
            "[The film invites] you to consider not only the many efforts to situate art but also how art might elude definition, and how people's stories about art can be awkward and self-regarding, however earnest and insistent."

            "A delight in that we're able to spend time with as rare a creature as Elaine Stritch, but the film's human elements elevate it to greater heights.",
            "In the same way that disabled and older people shouldn't be called \"inspiring\" just for living their lives... the film shows us that the effects of aging for [Elaine] Stritch aren't tragic but just inconveniences and obstacles for her to work around.",
            "What becomes a legend most? In Elaine Stritch's case, it's this riveting, unvarnished documentary portrait of the lioness in winter.",

            "There's an impressive candor and depth to this documentary about the life and career of Stritch.",

            "The characters surrounding Maleficent became caricatures as if they were pulled directly from a cartoon.",
            "It's a beautifully designed film, and James Newton Howard's fantastical score is one of his best in years. But what Maleficent most lacks isn't something you can see or hear, it's something you can feel.",
            "A fundamentally misguided interpretation of the title character, one that seems to misunderstand what drew people to her in the first place. ",
            "While it may in moments be a bit dark for very young ones, it is a great family film, worthy of the Disney canon.",

            "For those who either enjoy seeing inventive variations on a theme and/or who can take Maleficent on its own terms -- and for anyone who likes to see Jolie playing powerful women -- this is a great time, and a rather lovely one.",

            "The best of the movie finds a way to abridge the novel and still allow the scenes to breathe.",
            "Like many a lengthy novel, it might have worked better as a television series.",
            "\"Half of a Yellow Sun\" winds up being one of those movies in which a pesky event of great historical import keeps getting in the way of a soap-opera romance.",
            "The result is that melodramatic soap opera elements win out over Bandele's attempts at stirring historical drama. That said, it's still a story worth telling.",
            "There's nothing terrible about Half of a Yellow Sun, but not much good either. A powerful novel has been neutered.",
            "Overall, it's a fascinating slice of modern history that may be unfamiliar to some, which can also give us an insight into the making of contemporary Nigeria.",
            " Half Of A Yellow Sun is a compelling drama [that] ( ... ) form[s] a timeless tribute to the resistance of the human spirit in the face of war time struggle.",
            "An ambitious film worthy of attention, regrettably it doesn't come together quite as powerfully as you'd hope.",
            "A case of laudable ambition collapsed into episodic box-ticking.",
            "The plot goes everywhere and nowhere, coming across as a disconnected series of events rather than a unified whole. Ejiofor and Newton offer solid but unexceptional performances, as though hampered by the director's lack of vision.",
            "The actors shine: Thandie Newton, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Anika Noni Rose are all splendidly in their moment.",
            "Despite fine performances by Thandie Newton and Chiwetel Ejiofor, the clich\u00e9-riddled \"Yellow Sun\" burns cold.",
            "A well-intentioned historical drama that gets caught up in the undertow of mawkish melodrama early on, never to fully recover.",
            "\"Half of a Yellow Sun\" deals with human tragedy, but it never really makes a human connection.",
            "The audience's attachment to and investment in these people lend powerful intimacy to the large scale epic trappings.",
            "It's just not stirring enough as historical drama.",
            "Transporting, well acted, and occasionally powerful. It's also a rushed, maddening mess.",
            "A well-acted, finely wrought epic that nevertheless struggles to balance the requirements of melodrama with its drive to capture a historical moment.",
            "Disappointing, a romance pastiche that muddles the politics of the period beyond comprehension.",
            "Half of a truth. A generic take on the plight of the wealthy in war just about anywhere. And as a contrived cover for the real issues - how colonialist instigated chaos is always about oil and religion, and how Neo-Crusades in league with NGOs, kick in.",
            "A film compromised to some extent by its emphasizing of human melodrama rather than social and political issues that figure in the novel it is based on. But it still a gripping story about people caught up in a civil war sadly typical of Africa today.",

            "A horror franchise isn't born.",
            "More than anything the film shines because it isn't about the trauma or pain that Black women experience. Jinn is about identity, those beautiful, carefree days of youth, and how in a split second, one thing that is so deeply important can be replaced.",
            "Writer-director Ajmal Zaheer Ahmad serves up glossy visuals on the back of a limited budget. However, Jinn often feels like it's a showreel for his visual talents. An admittedly uneven one at that.",

            "Big Bad Wolves includes a good amount of humor in the dialogue, but never at the expense of the victims or the plot. ",
            "The problem that comes with Big Bad Wolves is that its excessive violence is too intrinsically tied to questions of morality to simply create excuses of \"it's just entertainment.\"",
            "At moments it's fun to watch the psychological drama unfold, and Grad is especially good as the vengeful father, but much of the movie is stomach-churning and visually flat.",

            "As dark comedies go, this is about as dark as it gets. The acting and stunt work are very solid. I can't say I enjoyed this, but the film is thought-provoking, occasionally funny, and it does raise some interesting moral questions.",
            "A grisly off-beat moralistic Israeli thriller about a suspected serial rapist killer being tortured by a cop and the victim's father.",

            "Wolves should appeal to fans of filmmakers such as Eli Roth and Quentin Tarantino.",
            "Despite its impressive intuition, inventiveness and staging, Big Bad Wolves remains a rather forgettable anecdote instead of a truly blood-freezing, Hitchcockian thriller."

            "Brilliant when exploring the creative process and the internal struggle any artist faces to make something good despite their doubts and fears. ",
            "By wearing his heart on his sleeve and exhibiting an unflinching degree of honesty and passion, Mistaken for Strangers traverses the banal hero worship and reverie of an orthodox music documentary.",
            "A road movie that plays with the conventions of a rockumentary to make a very intimate film about dealing with stardom. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Whether he's playing a character or simply being his goofy self, Tom Berninger is an impishly comic figure...",
            "A unique, eccentric and highly enjoyable mix of brotherly soap opera and behind-the-scenes cringe comedy that even newcomers to The National's moody charms will enjoy.",
            "With a loose, rambling style, this documentary starts as a backstage glimpse of a rock tour before shifting into an exploration of brotherhood and finally into something much more self-reflective. ",
            "It's an uneven affair, embraced as unguardedly \"intimate\" by some fans of the band, but in reality less moving than Anvil! The Story of Anvil, and lacking the objective insight of Terry Zwigoff's oddly comparable Crumb.",
            "We loved every minute of Tom's company and his film, right down to Halford's O Holy Night over the closing credits.",
            "It's the scenes detailing Tom's efforts to bring all the material together that demonstrate what he's really capable of, and they give the film a satisfying pay-off.",
            "An affecting, hilarious portrait of chalk/cheese sibling love, with a sweet twist: Tom thinks he's a loser, but his film is a winning one-off.",
            "It could easily have been a workaday music doc, but amid all the gigs, pit stops and sound checks emerges a funny and wry story of brothers at work.",
            "Possibly the most honest and complex and competent effort of its kind.",
            "A teasing essay on sibling tensions ... a backdrop for a gonzo self-portrait, a likeably self-deprecating music-biz counterpart to Louis C.K.'s TV shows.",
            "Ostensibly a behind-the-scenes tour document...but it can't detach itself from the point-of-view of its maker. So it becomes about itself. It's quietly ingenious that way.",
            "An engaging work of many colors, at once funny and heart-piercing. There may not be a better film this year about adult sibling jostling, rivalry and affection.",
            "A surprisingly different and funny take on life on the road with your little brother. ",
            "Mistaken for Strangers finds its footing in humor and good nature, and it's a thoroughly feel-good rock documentary with massive audience appeal, National fans or not."

            "Soon, however, it becomes heavily tinged with melancholy about Gordon's unfulfilled dream of having a family of his own. Interesting guy. ",
            "This documentary portrait by Mike Myers (of Wayne's World and Austen Powers fame) of his friend Shep Gordon comes close to hagiography but is just about saved by great anecdotes, stylistic inventiveness and the low-key charm of the man himself. ",
            "What could have been a very gooey, toe-curling exercise in self-congratulation is lifted by Shep Gordon himself.",
            "It makes for a lively, entertaining guide to the LA music scene in the 70s and 80s and the film business - Gordon dabbled in movie production.",

            "Because of pop-culture societies' overwhelming affection towards Shep, Supermensch plays more like a tribute film than an observational one, so what it lacks in depth, it makes up for in light-heartedness and simplicity.",
            "He's brilliant! He's funny! He's a genius! He's a total lothario! This is seriously the only thing anyone says for the entire convulsing 1 1/2 hours.",
            "This is a fascinating insight into the Hollywood machine through terrific old footage of some iconic faces. But it's Shep himself who makes this film so engaging.",
            "If the film is often pure hagiography, it's rescued by the huge charm of its subject, whose present-day interviews reveal a figure of compassion and humility.",
            "The stories are great... the kind of crazy Hollywood tales that could've only happened in the '70s.",
            "You may not have heard of this Hollywood legend, but you definitely know a few of his famous friends.",
            "The absurdly-paraphrased version of the story we come away with is that Gordon is the nicest guy to ever have worked in Hollywood and that good things happen to good people.",

            "More sugar-rush than Sugarman, but Gordon's extraordinary life just outside the spotlight is a whirlwind of charm and chutzpah.",
            "The obvious affection Myers feels for his subject is extremely touching, though you do wonder just how full a picture you're getting as a result."

            "It's as if Woody Allen dipped his pen in cyanide and directed a film in which the pithy misanthropy of Philip Roth has seeped into every frame.",
            "Listen Up Philip dares to suggest that allowing asshats to wallow in their own crapulence can actually be consoling for everyone who found themselves on the receiving end. And, in the end, aren't we all asshats?",
            "When it comes to intimidating emotional blankness, no one is more skilled than Jason Schwartzman.",
            "Perry shamelessly imitates his betters at their worst; only the arrogance is genuine.",
            "Listen Up Philip is a quirky movie that will satisfy those of a certain disposition. You'll never find it fascinating or frustrating but you can't deny that this is a breath of fresh air in that time of year when CGI is exploding across multiplexes.",
            "Running a bit longer than it needs to doesn't help, but regardless of any nitpicks, this is surely an interesting film and unlike many put out this year. It has its own particular atmosphere stamped on it.",
            "Listen Up Philip, in the end, is just like the central character it describes. It petulantly demands to be heard even as it has nothing to say.",
            "Between the slapdash and choking cinematography, the oppressive narration, and the hideous characters, I didn't find anything fun or funny in this so-called \"comedy.\"",

            "The cast give consistently good performances, with Elisabeth Moss on especially good form as Ashley.",
            "There are little touches as such, and Jason Schwartzman remains his usual self-destructive best, but whenever the film shifts away from his insufferable young hipster author, Listen Up Philip readily becomes a plodding bore.",
            "Everything works to add a greater intimacy to Philip's life: a life that we may enjoy looking into and a character that we may enjoy watching but, truthfully, a person that we would hate to be compared to ourselves.",
            "An odd vagueness of intention dissipates the energy of this initially bracing study of a novelist.",
            "After those 20 minutes pass, carried mostly by Schwartman, the movie finds its vintage brogue-clad feet.",
            "The dialogue is brilliant - fast, smart and incredibly funny.",
            "Playing the erudite idiot is second nature to Schwartzman, having done so in films dating back to Wes Anderson's Rushmore, and it's hard to imagine anyone else hurling elaborate insults with the same devastatingly flat delivery.",

            "...an easygoing sort of film. Rohmer takes his time getting where he's going. His is a measured gait, however, not just narrative meandering.",
            "For all his seeming facility with the opposite sex, Gaspard is really a romantic idiot. And aren't we all, Rohmer suggests.",
            "The fresh-faced actors, realistic dialogue and naturalistic performances suggest a casual approach, but as the story progresses, the filmmaker's control is increasingly evident.",
            "If it lacks its predecessor's subtlety and depth, it compensates with its own abundance of more immediate pleasures. ",
            "Wise, honest, breezy, witty and profound, A Summer's Tale is an intellectually and emotionally rewarding date movie for sophisticated couples. ",
            "It's a complex character study that reveals how little we can know of someone through conversation, as conversation often changes the way we both perceive and portray our sense of who we are.",
            "Originally released in 1996 in France (but never before in the U.S.), Eric Rohmer's sun-kissed love quadrangle remains as fresh and romantically profound as it was 18 years ago.",
            "Despite its googly-eyed missive to the power of romance fueling confidence and comfort, A Summer's Tale is most salient when addressing the bonds of friendship.",
            "Rohmer had an almost uncanny knack for using the mercurial predilections of the young as a launching pad for smart but not oppressive philosophical observations."

            "The movie is inspiring and tragic, and, directed by street artist One9, it's captured in an artful, emotional way that will speak to an audience beyond rap fans.",
            "Time Is Illmatic is well-informed but inessential, a making-of featurette barely expanded to feature length at a trim 74 minutes.",
            "Time Is Illmatic lovingly and honestly chronicles the making of an album that would influence many generations after its release.",
            "One9 opts for celebration over cultural discourse. It proves a minor shortcoming when you allow yourself to revel in the raw energy of Time Is Illmatic's predictably perfect soundtrack. ",
            "Just as \"Illmatic\" brought people from all across the globe a little closer to Queensbridge, Nas: Time is Illmatic draws audiences closer to hip-hop.",
            "Brief, informative and direct, the historical details post-Illmatic grow less interesting, yet the film's first half is electric and engaging.",

            "Where Time is Illmatic soars and surprises, is in its historical approach to this portrait, and in its portrayal of another side of the artist -- his brother, Jungle.",
            "A wide-reaching tale locks into focus: one about hope through music, told with style, feeling and economic punch.",
            "Here's 74 minutes well spent.",
            "As both an origin story about a great artist and a distillation of '80s urban blight, it's as breathless and real as any street-corner rhyme.",
            "It's a celebration of the seminal album's 20th anniversary, but also a dissection of the influences that allowed a street poet like Nas to create such an influential album.",
            "The album lives as a touchstone, and a turning point, in New York hip hop. The film may be far less significant, but it does bear witness to the music's greatness.",
            "Since many of the themes from \"Illmatic\" have become mere clich\u00e9s in contemporary rap, this film serves as a reminder of the potential and the promise that hip-hop truly holds."

            "How this all sorts itself out is a nail-biting treat...",
            "Eastern Boys cleanly escapes any accusation of blandness. An emotional uppercut of a film, Campillo's latest is one which may take several days to fully recover from.",
            "This is a tough, important film, and one that wields ambivalence like a cudgel.",
            "Wholly unsatisfying, interminable in length with marginal acting, at best, there is little but the opening 15 minutes and the mesmerizing Daniil Vorobov to recommend this film.",
            "The film tackles solidarity and solitude, economic class, language and lingering ages -- managing to remain engaging throughout most of its two hours-plus running time. ",
            "Dour, dark sexual drama about a rich, middle-aged French pervert (Olivier Rabourdin) who arranges for a rent boy to turn up to his plush apartment only to find his plans going awry.",

            "Campillo has fashioned an empathetic exploration of what it is to be an immigrant intertwined with an acutely original love story. This offering is clearly a highpoint of 2015 for any lover of challenging, yet immensely entertaining films. ",
            "It's a fairly straightforward home invasion set-up, but what makes writer-director Robin Campillo's sophomore feature so intriguing is how it carefully subverts expectations.",
            "A torrid, slow-burning, yet highly combustive French drama, Eastern Boys is rife with psychological tension and inter-cultural unease.",
            "(Writer-director Robin) Campillo's script takes several surprising turns, and the film's denouement is quite touching. The film manages to be both sexy and compassionate, which makes it all the more impressive.",
            "Warm, emotionally resonating and quietly powerful with tender, natural performances.",
            "The premise is so simple and the storytelling so uncluttered that it cannot fail to lodge in your mind.",
            "Impressively staged and non-judgmental study of the love between a john and a young hustler is compelling but a tad too cold.",

            "What a relief to watch this small, expert film - a pane of glass in a concrete wall - that whispers, that dares to stand still and witness ordinary human pain."

            "Gibney unearths a wealth of archive footage that reaffirms Kuti's superstar status, and watches as Jones wrestles with the contradictions that made the musician such a troublesome icon - confronting some, sidestepping others.",

            "It's a film that's determined to demystify an enigma, but the sobering reality is that the most enlightening way into the mind of this artist is doubtlessly to listen to his records."

            "It's diverting to watch and has moments of brilliance, but even with all its refreshing female characters, \"May in the Summer\" doesn't leave a lasting impression.",
            "The vibe is like that of a Lifetime movie that happens to be set in Amman rather than American suburbia. Just sub in camel sightings in place of white-tailed deer.",

            "As much as May in the Summer is a comedy-May and her mischievous sisters may remind you of The Three Stooges-it is also an intimate and demystifying look at life in Amman, where the movie was actually filmed.",

            "Documentary filmmaker Lotfy Nathan explores the outlaw appeal of an inner-city Baltimore dirt-bike gang through the eyes of a 13-year-old wannabe member named Pug.",
            "It could have romanticized its subjects, portraying them as outlaws and folk heroes. Or it could have gone the way of moral panic. To its credit, [it] does neither of these things - or, rather, it does both, in the most subtle and insightful way possible.",
            "Take a closer look, as Lofty Nathan does in his freewheeling debut feature... and bike gangs like the 12 O'Clock Boys start to differentiate as more than just a dangerous nuisance.",
            "[Pug is] a fiercely individual child, but, inevitably, his predicament also symbolizes how poverty can warp a good boy's nature.",
            "[It] spectacularizes black criminality for white middle-class viewers, the primary audience for the festivals and art houses where this film will have its career.",
            "Nathan's onscreen portrayal of Baltimore is a grim, but wholly alive piece of documentary filmmaking.",
            " The filmmaking on 12 O'Clock Boys is masterfully even-handed and fastidiously detailed.",
            "This defiance of the law, combined with the skill, speed and excitement, is part of the romance that draws Pug and other kids into the biker life. It is like the wild west.",
            "The result is evocative and compelling, even if it doesn't offer much context or socioeconomic insight into its broader subject.",
            "There's no balance of perspective, but what the feature lacks in fullness it makes up for in pure energy, extracting a sense of life in motion as its influence by a false sense of security.",
            "With stunning footage and a choppy narrative, 12 O'Clock Boys captures the paradoxical feelings driving these young men through the streets of Baltimore.",
            "For a first-time filmmaker, Nathan achieves a remarkable balance, presenting each side with very little bias.",
            "One of the more unique looks at the Other America to come down the line in recent years",
            "It's the rare film that gets deep into low income inner city life and zeroes in on what motivates those whom society tends to forget.",
            "An arresting nonfiction look at a subculture of young African-American dirt-bike enthusiasts who view their hobby as a ride-or-die proposition -- a dangerous way to act out proxy battles with authority.",
            "Well-edited and often thrilling, but leaves you with more questions than answers and feels incomplete. ",
            "An exciting, beautifully shot look at a subculture through the eyes of one of its most devoted admirers.",
            "It's important to remember that not every day is a joy ride. 12 O'Clock Boys is also a portrait of a family.",
            "12 O'Clock Boys shows the culture for what it is: thrilling, compelling and more than a little dangerous.",
            "This slice-of-life effort presents a complicated picture when it comes to the world of urban dirt biking, acknowledging the dangers involved while celebrating its utility as an outlet for the pent-up emotions of a people left behind by society.",
            "Lotfy Nathan's hand-held camerawork, combined with a snappy hip-hop soundtrack, gives the documentary a sense of immediacy.",
            "It's positive, it's inspiring, it's beautiful.",
            "That Nathan is able to cover so much ground in a mere 76 minutes makes 12 O'Clock Boys all the more remarkable and essential."

            "Unbroken is an odyssey detailing a harrowing ordeal and insurmountable odds. But this polished story feels conventional, overly long and not sufficiently involving. [Full review in Japanese]",
            "Unbroken falls short of the epic war drama and sweeping testament-to-the-human-spirit it strives to be.",
            "It is a handsome film, bleak and dark and elegantly filmed told with a mixture of intensity and something like restraint, even distance. ",
            "\"Unbroken\" is a rousing old-fashioned yarn with numerous exciting set-pieces and an uncomplicated hero you root for all the way through. It's entertaining throughout and made with a high level of technical skill.",
            "It turns out to be a rousing, full blooded war movie but one which also sometimes feels derivative and a little heavy handed.",
            "A straightforward and entirely commendable story about the triumph of the human spirit, etc.",
            "An incredible story of survival and human endurance told in bland, flat strokes.",
            "Once the indomitable spirit of the man is revealed, the movie finds a sturdy, stirring tone which carries it well through some very tough going. ",
            "It's long, uninteresting, and paced like one of those nightmares where you keep trying to run BUT YOU CAN'T! It's that bad.",
            "Beautifully, if sometimes too glossily mounted, Angelina Jolie's sophomore effort as a director, Unbroken, is too poker faced to enjoy either as a dramatic motion picture or a document of an excruciating, unnecessary experience. ",
            "Unbroken doesn't penetrate the surface of emotions, remaining a slightly detached, albeit respectful, representation of a potentially touching and inspiring true story.",
            "A solid film with a great story that is ultimately unremarkable in its telling.",
            "Though excelling with casting, Jolie's direction falls short in style and execution; cheesy dissolves and trite biopic techniques are distractingly formulaic, fracturing absorption with Unbroken's brutal and shocking content.",
            "Unbroken should feel like a horror movie (I can't imagine a more frightening existence than Zamperini's time in the prison), but instead feels like a pedestrian, gussied-up biopic.",
            "The posters claim the movie is about \"Survival. Resilience. Redemption,\" but it only gives us the first two, and the finished product is less effective because of it.",
            "The result is the telling of a good story, but not an illuminating one.",
            "This film, based on the biography of the same title, is lukewarm, at best.",
            "A lacklustre and dull film about an incredibly remarkable man.",
            "I assume that for those who have read the book, you will be disappointed in the film. For those that have not read the book, go buy it. It's most assuredly going to be better than the film.",
            "It's all quite beautiful to look at at points, but it never indulges in the emotional weight of what's being portrayed and it manages to make this harrowing, hard-to-believe tale ... boring.",
            "Unbroken is competent at best, and we know that Zamperini was a great man. But he was more than the sum of this movie's parts.",

            "There is surprisingly little emotional impact from such an incredible story.",
            "Unbroken is one messy film that is poorly edited, a collage of scenes that never really come together as a whole, and an overly long repetitive pile of boredom"

            "[Miss Lovely] isn't always appetizing, but Ahluwalia's commitment to accurately capturing the era's aesthetic almost compensates for his failure to mine a good story from a great setting. ",
            " The women of the film certainly deserve better, as they're often relegated to the role of victim, harmed or murdered simply to propel the plot along.",
            "What it is exactly is a little uncertain, given the film's curiously sluggish pace for a retro-thriller and discouragingly murky camerawork that makes action sequences, especially, hard to follow.",

            "Simple but engrossing, Canadian director Richie Mehta's Siddharth is the story of an Indian father searching for his missing son, and offers a window into the lives of India's working poor that goes beyond the familiar issues of food and shelter.",
            "Tension builds along with hopelessness but Mehta avoids making judgments or giving easy answers about the circumstances that led to Siddharth being sent off to work.",

            "A spare, lean, and decidedly unsettling account of the ugly reality of child labor and child abduction in India.",
            "Some first rate performances tend to override the film's smaller faults to concoct a gravely serious and affecting film.",
            "Joyous, heartrending and illuminating, Siddharth is a film that's more about how the daunting journey changes a family than where it takes them.",

            "It's a striking and polished addition to the catalogue of recent cinema set in India and is a bracing antidote to the spit-shined glibness of Slumdog Millionaire.",
            "The film is made up of details, and these details create characters who are human beings and not just one dimensional victims.",
            "Mehta keeps his sociopolitical critique in the background, allowing it to inform but not interfere with his intimate and devastating story.",
            "Powerful family drama.",
            "By any fair measure, Siddharth is a very good example of world cinema, offering us a window into a world we would not otherwise see. But be cautioned: it is not exactly an \"up\" film. ",
            "By the end, it feels like you're the only one who helped carry Mahendra's horrifying burden in a heavily-populated country.",
            "There's not a hint of melodrama here, and the tale is all the more compelling for it. For a film set half a world away, Siddharth hits very close to home.",

            "The performances are splendid.",
            "A stirring central performance caps a modest yet moving slice of a life fictionalised in its details but real in its sorrow.",
            "Propelled by a hauntingly beautiful music score, Richie Mehta's film about a missing 12 year old boy and the father who searches for him is profoundly sad, as it reveals disturbing truths.",
            "It pains me to say this, but I'd almost prefer the mindlessness of \"Taken\" over the social preaching of \"Siddharth.\" ",

            "It lacks the cohesive action and compelling spirit so evident in the first two films.",
            "Since this is a 'Part 1 of 2,' it makes it difficult to address in a review. The problem with splitting a film into two pieces is you only get to see part of the whole.",

            "Although solidly packaged with, for the most part, solid performances, Mockingjay Part 1 feels restrained. The exuberance and anticipatory excitement within both 'The Hunger Games' and 'Catching Fire' is missing here.",
            "Without the hook of its titular games in the mix, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1, plays like a rote dystopian thriller.",
            "The Hunger Games films are worth revisiting; they're Y.A. dystopia done right, balancing fantastic and realistic elements well. They're also full of excellent performers.",
            "Interesting for its drifting away from the formulaic model already established, yet it feels something like a misnomer of a film, more of an extended prologue to a finale rather an actual 'part' deserving of its own distinction.",

            "When absorbed into the series as a whole, this chapter supplies some of the most thought-provoking, sophisticated thematic content to ever find its way into so-called \"young adult\" science fiction.",
            "As one film, Mockingjay could be much tighter and streamlined, but it feels drawn out and a little aimless. ",
            "The Hunger Games hasn't given birth to twins. Instead, it has stretched out the limbs of its concluding chapter to the point of cracking dislocation.",
            "...ultimately Part One will go down as the film you sat through while you waited for the more exciting main event, the conclusion, due out this time next year.",
            "Collins' revolutionary-lite rhetoric has become unravelled by the commercially driven decision to split the final novel into two films -- ultimately lessening the satirical bite and reverting to the gender archetypes it originally sought to challenge."

            "This ambitious and heartbreaking documentary tackles no less mammoth a subject than the African-American identity as it exists in photographic imagery.",
            "A fascinating, visually stunning, emotionally devastating documentary by Thomas Allen Harris.",
            "This is sound-bite cinema, revealing at times, but also frustratingly basic stuff.",
            "With the thousand words vividly painted through each picture, we connect, identify and find solidarity.",
            "Harris indulges in too many personal memoir detours and overdoes the talking heads, but much of the imagery on display is extraordinary.",
            "Though a tad uneven, as a whole the documentary cannily juggles an overview of African-American history in general with the specifics of its photographic representation and talents.",
            "Thomas Allen Harris' lush, lovely, loving Through a Lens Darkly chronicles the role of photography in a 170-year history of the lives of black Americans. A teeming abundance of stirring and often brilliant imagery by African-American artists.",
            "Provocative and mildly engaging. It could have used a better organization of its wealth of facts. ",
            "It's all way too much, for in his desire to be comprehensive, Harris plumb forgets that less would have been more.",
            "Perhaps too ambitious in scope, a few truly powerful sequences still manage to elevate this historical overview of African-American photography above its uneven style.",
            "Director Thomas Allen Harris has made an earnest, though often sloppy, documentary on the essential role imagery plays in shaping the narrative of a people.",
            "Thomas Allen Harris's documentary consistently takes agency away from the art itself with a litany of talking heads. ",
            "The photographs on view are dazzling; the way they are shown here is somewhat less so.",
            "The old saw about a picture being worth a thousand words indicates the extraordinary power of the images \"Through a Lens Darkly\" organizes so thoughtfully and compellingly.",
            "The film is always absorbing to watch, but only once it's over do you begin to grasp the extent of its ambitions, and just how much it has done within a packed, compact hour and a half.",
            "Would that Harris had simply let the images and their historical context speak for themselves.",
            "I just wish that, given it's a film about art, Through a Lens Darkly had taken a bit more of an artistic method to its message.",
            "It's essential info presented with little imagination."

            "Despite being inspired by actual events, it all comes off more confounding than tragic or romantic.",
            "It illustrates, both bluntly and gently, the stultifying trap of male influence.",
            "Hausner's film feels authentically quiet and slower-paced for the time period ...",
            "It can be a strategically off-putting movie yet one that also steals under your skin scene by scene and through Ms. Schnoeink's slowly revealing performance as an ill-fated heroine turned future biographical footnote.",
            "It's a truly a film you don't want to look away from.",
            "Hausner has a created a studied and visually beautiful film that calmly presents a strange, haunting and fascinating true story.",
            "Hausner's tactful camera rarely moves, capturing still lives of perfect minimalist composition. The tragedy of Amour Fou is of the quiet variety, and it's one which Hausner has pitched almost perfectly.",
            "Amour Fou is a splendid and superbly crafted comedy for the intellectual.",
            "The story has the potential to be emotionally bombastic, but Hausner's careful direction keeps us at a determined remove.",
            "Hausner is very skilled at bringing out the ambiguities of her material, and keeps shifting the tone towards sardonic humour.",
            "Ms. Hausner's film proceeds at a stately, measured pace, and uses classical compositions and stiff exchanges to underline the tedium of early 19th-century bourgeois life.",
            "The film looks very beautiful, austere for sure but gorgeously staged and framed. The performances are very good but although it's not very long, it does lack some punch. One for fans of austere auteurs.",
            "The Austrian director's sixth film is ecstatically original: a work of film-history-philosophy with a digital-cinema palette of acutely crafted compositions.",
            "Fatally labors under excessively Teutonic discipline.",
            "Austrian director Jessica Hausner has fashioned a formal, feminist, wickedly humorous variation on history.",
            "From this droll premise, potentially as dark and dry as blackened toast, Hausner spins a witty, unexpectedly touching meditation on the nature of partnership and the elasticity of fate.",
            "This visual confinement underscores the lack of intimacy and agency in Henriette's life. Her longing for escape is understandable. She's surrounded by men for whom a woman's life is predicated on silence.",
            "Hausner has cast the movie brilliantly: We know volumes about wife, husband, and poet just from their faces and the way they move.",
            "There's no blood pumping through Hausner's characters' veins.",
            "Despite the film's tightly constructed reserve, Hausner saves one last trick for the end: As unknowable as these characters are, you may be surprised how much you miss them.",
            "Finely finessed in gesture and metronymically measured in pace.",
            "In Hausner's deft hands, the comedy makes the existential exercise even more challenging, forcing the audience to ponder awkward truths beneath the chilly humor."

            "Remarkably intimate and astute.",
            "Although expertly edited, Johnsen's film, whose soundtrack ends with Nina Simone's \"Feeling Good,\" presents a less effective portrait of Ai than Klayman's does.",
            "The film quietly and slowly reveals a man struggling internally to find the right response to the restrictions imposed on him and determining that to stop speaking out would itself be a kind of death.",
            "Johnsen intimately chronicles the fascinating push-pull of Ai's daily existence: the man he truly is now contrasted with the man he hopes to become once again.",
            "\"If I don't share my voice,\" he says, \"then I am dead already.\" It sounds almost like a dare.",
            "A bold political statement, affirming the freedom of expression in a time when it can land an artist jail.",

            "Ai Weiwei: The Fake Case finds its titular subject beaten but unbowed.",
            "The view from his high rise windows include the United States Embassy right next door, a reminder of the freedom he longs for in his native country. A freedom he knows can be taken away in the blink of an eye.",
            "A unique portrait of an artist in turmoil.",
            "Chinese dissident Ai Weiwei is a lot of things: Artist, activist, father, son. What he's not, is dull. But you'd never know it judging by Andreas Johnsen's somnambulant take on his subject's Sisyphean fight for human rights. ",
            "While little more than an update on an ongoing dispute, The Fake Case is a welcome chance to catch up with the quirky artist's heroic struggle for freedom.",
            "Heartening chronicle of the further \"crazy dreams\" of an artist who doesn't intend to have freedom defined for him by the state.",
            "Ai comes across as highly intelligent, weary, extremely wary of outsiders but with a puckish sense of humor.",
            "The film is not terribly involving except to Ai's followers.",
            "In The Fake Case, Danish filmmaker Andreas Johnsen connects with Chinese artist Ai Weiwei after his 81-day solitary confinement for subversion of state power, and deftly portrays a man untrammeled by his opponents.",
            "Mr. Johnsen offers viewers the challenge and pleasure of an important artist's company, and a chance to appreciate anew his wisdom, his wit and his bravery.",
            "An enlightening Danish documentary about one of the world's most famous and creative human rights activists.",
            "China's government can't handle dissident artist Ai Weiwei. He turns every move to suppress him into brilliant conceptual art.",
            "Intimate portrait of a stubborn artist. . .demonstrates the power of government control to inflict disruptive stress, the power of art to transform repression into optimism.",
            "The Fake Case isn't an official sequel to Alison Klayman's 2012 documentary Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry, but it might as well be, as this fascinating and necessary coda picks up right where that earlier film left off ...",
            "Accessible documentary serves as useful introduction to and informative update on an artist who's seldom out of the headlines for long.",
            "The Fake Case contextualizes Ai's struggle by positioning it in relation to his family history."

            "An inspiring, educational, highly enjoyable documentary from director Patrick Creadon, best known for 2008's I.O.U.S.A., which chronicled America's less-than-healthy fiscal condition.",
            "The film is about innovation inside and outside the classroom and the transformative power of good teaching.",
            "[Creadon] probably errs on the side of advocacy here. But give him credit for acknowledging that idealistic endeavors don't always pay off.",
            "A bracing, quietly exhilarating documentary about a group of high school students who discover their inner architects over the course of an academic year.",
            "The film proves not only a stirring look at education's potential to rally and invigorate but also a vital snapshot of contemporary rural America.",
            "The scattered pieces come together to form a thoughtful examination of the need to keep students engaged with education, and the challenges that arise in attempting anything against the grain.",
            "It's a limited viewpoint of a much larger, high-stakes issue.",
            "It's joyful upon seeing the kids realize there's a humanitarian angle to all this and discover they can do more than what the run-down surroundings dictate to them.",

            "You'll be happy you saw this film.",

            "This is a compelling narrative both in its own terms and as a metaphor of many of the core themes and conflicts in America today. ",
            "If they build it, you should still stay home.",
            "At its core, If You Build It isolates the power of a hands-on education and consideration for the greater good.",
            "Like a movie about people who see someone with a broken leg and say, \"I bet you'd feel better after a massage.\"",

            "Unfortunately, as with so many social-survey documentaries, the film's macro view comes at the expense of any microcosmic depth. ",
            "That one comes away with so many questions speaks to the film's inspirational quality.",
            "Not that Mr. Miller, Ms. Pilloton and their budding brainstormers don't deserve it, but the film's style ultimately makes this feel more like a firm pat on the back than a richly conveyed experience.",
            "More informative than emotional, the documentary catches some of the angst involved in such an undertaking, but always appears to be engaging with the subjects at a respectful arm's length.",
            "This honest and engrossing film shows how ingenuity and spark can restore excitement in education. That goal needs every helping hand it can get.",
            "Credit goes to Creadon for venturing beyond the classroom to look at how the teachers and students manage small victories despite limited resources."

            "Never quite fully delivers much more than yet another oh-poor-me take on post-collegiate struggles in the cold, cruel 21st Century.",
            "There is potentially a good movie bubbling under the surface in the interaction between Amy and Rat and especially in the hinted-at desperation of her struggle to make a success of her life, but this is overtaken by the tedious melodramatic whining.",

            "Completely stealing the show and delivering my favorite supporting turn of the year so far is Armando Riesco.",
            "Adult World goes all kinds of satisfying places and the lowercase niceties begin with knowing how to use Emma Roberts' eyes, and their bright, darting gaze, which can flick from irritation to consternation to fury just like one-two-three.",
            "It is genuinely funny and surprisingly touching by the end, which is more than can be said for most of Hollywood's efforts of late.",
            "The movie is rated R, yet sensitive 12-year-old girls and the boys scared to talk to them probably represent the ideal audience for this wan coming-of-age sitcom in feature-film drag.",
            "A fittingly rough zoom on the transitional period between dreams and reality, seen through a girl who says she 'can't be a wunderkind past 22' and mostly means it.",
            "\"Adult World\" is amusing, if a bit by the numbers. There's nothing surprising about Amy's story.",
            "A nice shot of reality could've saved Adult World, as the details of desperation are far more compelling than the rusted mechanics of a numbing coming-of-age story.",
            "[There's] so much vivid, irrepressible life shoving through the narrative's seams that its structural defects can be forgiven, or at least largely ignored.",
            "Once Roberts intersects with Cusack, his practiced cynicism balances out her manic episodes, and they make a winning team",
            "Adult World earns an A for effort",
            "The core of the film -- the relationship between Amy and Rat -- clicks in a very real, very entertaining way.",
            "A smart, incisive comedy about a recent college grad's booby-trapped immersion into real life.",
            "Coffey knows his movie's at its best when Cusack and Roberts collide, and repeatedly uses them to overcome the script's limitations, and almost to dig a pit of chaos beneath it.",
            "Mr. Cusack's sardonic, understated portrayal of Rat, who is not quite what he says he is, grounds the movie in a wistfully cynical realism.",
            "This amiable, occasionally sharp-eyed movie makes us understand ... that lofty ambition often equals an evasion of hard work, humility and the insight that not everyone has what it takes.",
            "Andy Cochran's script for Adult World, by turns literate and quirky, and sharply observant throughout, provides the amiable fuel for this funny, endearing study of youthful aspiration."

            "The languid pace effectively communicates the characters' crushing boredom, yet the dramatic interest never flags.",
            "While the climax of Beneath the Harvest Sky is a jumble of crosscutting, thunderstorms, and an inconveniently collapsing house, the movie never loses the pulse of people and tragedies it knows too well.",
            "For all its missteps, the film feels authentic. Through thick and thin, it stubbornly maintains a thorny integrity.",
            "Directors Aron Gaudet and Gita Pullapilly are documentarians making their fiction debut, and they pack the movie with seemingly authentic, nitty-gritty details about life in the potato country of far northern Maine.",
            "Teenagers in a dead-end town aren't exactly a trailblazing topic.",
            "Gaudet and Pullapilly have a background in documentaries, and there's a convincing naturalism to their storytelling.",
            "While we're never surprised at the outcomes, we're satisfied because few if any notes ring false.",
            "The performances in \"Beneath the Harvest Sky\" are better than the movie itself, an exceedingly derivative teen melodrama that too often loses focus and meanders off on lugubrious tangents with its criminal subplots.",
            "A story that unfolds nearly as slowly as the potatoes ripen in the fields, the charismatic performances of the two young leads make all the difference.",
            "Casper and Dominic are modern everymen -- theirs are not at all unique experiences, which is why their story resounds so loudly.",
            "Beneath the Harvest Sky never finds a proper balance between its two halves. They never cohere properly, and the results pitch and lurch rather than harmonize.",
            "An authentic representation of teenage angst. Beneath the Harvest Sky offers a genuine view of what it's like to grow up in rural poverty.",
            "Their leap from fact to fiction doesn't come without a few stumbles on the way, but Gaudet and Pullapilly effectively symbolize a generation that has one foot on the gas and both eyes closed, and if you can appreciate that, your time will not be wasted.",
            "[T]his exploration of male youth lacks a truthfulness to make it stand out. The story of these boys doesn't feel special or unique ... the weight of their situation doesn't feel earned.",
            "It flourishes in the spaces between the plot's necessary setups and subsequent payoffs, which is nearly enough to redeem the film if not for the narrative going belly up in the third act.",
            "A film that ultimately comes across like the formulaic stepson of Frozen River, Winter's Bone, and countless other rundown-rural-community character studies.",
            "Harvest Sky [has an] overall familiarity, embodied by two lead performances that aren't nearly as specific and detailed as the milieu they inhabit.",
            "Beneath the Harvest Sky offers a heartbreakingly authentic, vividly realized account of adolescent frustration and yearning.",
            "The film offers a solid sense of place and Gaudet and Pullapilly expertly use the jittery camerawork of Steven Calitri to infuse the proceedings with a nervy energy.",
            "Performances are strong, if a bit Method-y, and camera work from veteran documentary filmmakers Aron Gaudet and Gita Pullapilly is top notch, though the schematic plot feels over-familiar.",
            "...filmmakers Aron Gaudet and Gita Pullapilly offer up a central character, in the form of Cohen's Casper, that couldn't possibly be more unlikable..."

            "There are slow bits, as Baumane delves into stories that are less interesting than others. But overall, her family history is rife with complex characters, and she brings them all to life in a loving, if scrutinizing, way.",
            "Signe Baumane... wrote and directed this feature-length animation about her family history of bipolar disorder, and despite its thorough treatment of the subject, it's surprisingly lighthearted and free of self-regard.",
            "[A] sardonically hilarious, sneakily moving, autobiographical animated feature.",
            "not an easy film to watch...But it serves as a striking reminder of the countless individuals who suffer similar pains in silence, and of the special power of animation to make the unseen visible.",
            "Coasting over the denials and euphemisms offered by nervous uncles and cousins, Baumane uncovers a gene pool heavily freighted with mental illness, depression and self-annihilation.",
            "Latvian animator Signe Baumane's film not only imbues tragic subject matter with beautiful imagery, but balances the film with a certain amount of levity.",
            "We have had few if any first-person accounts from \"crazy\" women filmmakers about how they see their own lives and minds. Animator and artist Signe Baumane's first feature, Rocks in My Pockets, seeks to change that situation. ",
            "The animation is so inventive and surprising.",
            "Baumane's animation is quite striking, often taking viewers down surreal, symbolically resonant rabbit holes, and her message is also empowering and ultimately upbeat.",
            "Baumane draws upon a rich history of European animation to propel Rocks in My Pockets, her charming, incisive and very contemporary study of generational depression and suicidal tendencies.",
            "Where the film really scores, though, is in Baumane's ability to communicate depression metaphorically to those of us on the outside looking in.",
            "In a year when Robin Williams got us all to open up about depression, this movie felt more essential on that topic than any of the late comic's final roles.",

            "Who knew that hara-kiri was such a hilarious subject?",
            "This inventive animated feature about depression and familial roots suggests NPR's \"The Moth\" storytelling series by way of Persepolis, mixing mesmerizing memoir monologue with whimsical animation.",
            "Rocks in My Pockets offers no easy answers for \"outsmarting DNA\" as it puts it, but it is optimistic in the end, and not in a sarcastic way. Well, only in a semi-sarcastic way.",
            "A wild and weird animated feature about a Latvian grandmother who passes on her depression to others in the family circle.",

            "If the film offers any ray of hope in the so bleak world of this film it is references to the speaker now living in New York, having escaped the desolate world of Latvia for a second chance in the New World. "

            "Hittman wraps her pointed agenda in a deceptively lovely tone poem about adolescence and summer, almost impressionistic in its evocation of the raging hormones of the teenage years.",
            "It's neither overly sentimental nor obnoxiously cautionary.",
            "First-time feature filmmaker Hittman, working with the talented DP Sean Porter, has a natural way with visuals that communicates the curiosity running rabid through the blood of summer-idle teenagers. ",

            "A mood poem to summer loving and sexual awakening, \"It Felt Like Love\" powerfully evokes a time when flesh is paramount, and peer behavior is the standard by which we judge our own.",
            "In her pitch-perfect feature film debut, writer-director Eliza Hittman explores the terrible uncertainties of adolescence, and in the process reclaims the word \"girls\" for its rightful owners.",
            "The filmmaker has fallen for some of indiedom's worst clich\u00e9s, including our main character's sad stare out to the ocean, and soft camerawork that's beginning to sound like a Klaxon: Hug me, hug me, hug me.",
            "[The director] Hittman demonstrates enough talent [...] to suggest that she could make a terrific film. All she needs is an original idea.",
            "More than anything else, It Felt Like Love successfully turns the coming-of-age formula into a foreboding nightmare.",
            "While there's nothing unusual about seeing a teenager trying to break free of the unindividuated and invisible state of childhood, the way in which it unfolds in Eliza Hittman's debut feature is deeply uncomfortable.",

            "An often challenging and ponderous work.",
            "We accuse directors who indulge in metatextual moviemaking of disappearing up their own rear ends. In the case of Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi, it's a choice between there and prison.",
            "The value of Closed Curtain is the very ineloquence of its cri de coeur. Where its predecessor defiantly showed that Panahi could take it, here the stresses show: they're tearing him apart, and it shouldn't happen to any artist.",
            " Under house arrest,Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi bravely concedes that, at times during his incarceration, he's worn down, tempted to end it all.",
            "Enigmatic, unresolved (perhaps deliberately) and strangely reminiscent of Bergman, Closed Curtain is not Panahi's strongest work but manages, all the same, to make visible the effects of a tremendous condensed power.",

            "Less satisfying than his previous pic, yet still a bold, melancholy statement.",

            "The film strongly evokes the spirit and playfulness of the Nouvelle Vague ...",

            "There's nothing even remotely new about this self-conscious little indie, one in which the seeds of dramatic sincerity are smothered by constant affectation.",
            "A determined lack of formality gives the film its sense of immediacy and edginess, though this is largely wasted as spontaneity is largely absent. ",
            "Betbeder's tale of aging Parisian art-school grads falling in love is told as a near-relentless collage of fourth-wall-breaking monologues -- \"High Fidelity\"-style -- and peppered with chapter breaks, dream sequences, and clips from other movies."

            "Stations of the Elevated plays like a time capsule, particularly for having no dialogue or plot. It swings to Charles Mingus's hardest bop and evokes a long-gone city, somehow more adult and confrontational even in silence.",
            "The film's range of subjects and ideas quickly expands to probe the exhilaration of city life itself.",
            "Lumbering, skronking, and wondrously paint-bombed, Manfred Kirchheimer's Stations of the Elevated (1981) is a 45-minute proto-hip-hop bliss-out, a masterpiece of train- and tag-spotting ...",
            "All that we see in this beautiful, poetic documentary is nothing less than the birthplace of hip-hop.",
            "New York can be a chaotic city, and [Charles] Mingus' music (and personality) a volatile match, but there are tender moments to both the city and the music.",
            "Kirchheimer appears more interested in the way the subway interacts with urban life, cutting through neighbourhoods like a scalpel through flesh and how people have taken to the individual subway cars as canvases to educate, provoke, and infuriate. ",
            "Kirchheimer relies on formal compositions of New York's subway rail yards, elevated platforms, and surrounding locations to tell a complex tale of environmental and urban dislocation where pop art billboards inform ghetto children..",
            "Director Manfred Kirchheimer brings the graffiti-tagged trains, enormous billboards and quirky architecture of 1970s New York City to life with a fabulous kinetic energy."

            "Feels cobbled together from every other action movie you can vaguely remember having seen.",
            "The historical/geopolitical calendar is a little topsy-turvy. We begin with 9/11, then go into a cold war-style showdown in Moscow. Perhaps Islamophobia has become too yesterday.",
            "Chris Pine headlines this post-Cold War spy caper whose pleasures are few and far between.",
            "Hollywood vets Branagh and Costner pretty much steal the show.",
            "It has some genuinely tense moments, but the story remained thin and recycled ... It was as though I watched a rerun of a one hour TV show stretched out to a two hour film.",
            "Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is your typical, corny spy movie, relying heavily on coincidences and good fortune.",
            "Any momentum in \"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit\" trips over the clunky love story that carries no emotional impact, wanders off in the convoluted plot, or gets lost in silly Russian accents.",
            "A good movie leaves you questioning previous notions. A series of cliches vaguely edited in the shape of a movie like Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit makes you question your previous decisions.",
            "Shadow Recruit isn't awful, but it doesn't possess the depth nor the thrills to join the ranks of Bond, Bourne, or even TV's Bauer. ",
            "It seems an insecure secret agent does not a good action movie make, and before long Ryan is essentially executing all the Bond-like manoeuvres inherent in many an action film that has come before it.",
            "It doesn't have a style distinctive to a franchise (like a Bond or Bourne movie does). But for what it's worth, this fast straight-shooter is a splash of summer thrill in the winter.",
            "Despite Pine's flimsy take as Ryan not being saucy enough to generate any characterization complexity, Shadow Recruit is still serviceable as a viable actioner that embraces its manufactured intrigue with ambitious gusto.",
            "A serviceable enough entry that, had Paramount been more diligent about keeping the series plugging along, we'd probably already talking about the next one.",
            "It all feels less like a film and more like a product; a generic store-brand version of a movie you can get for much better quality if you look a bit harder.",
            "The film's 105-minute runtime offers brisk pacing but kiddie-pool depth storytelling (not to mention familiar too).",
            "While much of it is good, it often feels overly derivative of other action movie franchises, which is probably why it failed to reignite the series.",
            "Kenneth Branagh brings us the reboot of the franchise with a little bit into Jack's background, a little bit of action, a little bit of suspense, and nothing that is ultimately memorable or new to fans of Ryan's stories.",
            "A familiar espionage tale.",
            "Shadow Recruit may not quite be up to the level of the older Clancy entries (and due to the author's death last year, we won't be getting any new source novels), but it is a fun ride.",
            "For avid fans of espionage thrillers, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is modestly watchable. For the rest, wait for something different.",
            "Watching a man hunched over his laptop, muttering about money transfers, isn't very thrilling."

            "Watching it in the era of Twitter does make \"Level Five\" feel like a distant lamentation on the failure of technology - indeed of cinema itself. It's a record of the questions we once asked, and how we essentially already lost the fight. ",

            "...[Level Five] effortlessly anticipated the aesthetic and thematic shifts of 21st-century cinema, even as it addressed the history and legacy of the 20th.",
            "Tension is explored between the medium and the message - namely, how history becomes selectively fashioned for the medium through which it is depicted rather than the other way around.",
            "This film demands every cell of your cerebellum, but its compelling surreality is hard to shake off.",
            "Level Five pictorializes the cruel moment when curiosity encounters tragedy, and the all-too-human abandonment of interest that can follow. ",

            "Less an investigation into or comprehensive summary of the Penn State sex-abuse scandal than a look at the feelings it elicited, Amir Bar-Lev's Happy Valley is more concerned with the phenomenon of team spirit than any single question of fact.",
            "Bar-Lev's cameras prowl the streets of State College, Penn. to not only expose the details of the crimes, but uncover a hero-worshiping, sometimes ferociously self-justifying, culture.",

            "The sheer amount of information that Belzberg had to organize, and fit into a seamless whole, is awe-inspiring. The pace feels like an unstoppable river, the current of history, the continuum of atrocity that Lemkin and others sensed.",
            "Succeeds in throwing a much-needed light on a man whose hermitlike life remains mysterious, but whose legacy will shine on for the ages.",
            "The way the film smoothly transitions from live-action to animation, from today's struggles to Lemkin's past, shows how much of Lemkin's experiences, including what he fought against, remain tragically relevant to this day.",
            "Moves beyond outrage at singular atrocities. . .to credit Lemkin's prescience in demonstrating difficulty in identifying genocide, to stop it, and meting out punishment.",

            "The film's message is so powerful, some of the poetic flourishes are unnecessary.",

            "This is, to put it mildly, a lot of information for one documentary, which inevitably devolves to resemble not so much an anthology as a slideshow of genocide's greatest hits.",

            "Only the most callous anti-immigration zealot could fail to find these stories poignant, but there's something awkwardly artificial about the dramatised strand ...",
            "We learn the cruelty of a system of hope in which the longing for a better life is the bait to lure people to an untimely death.",
            "Leaves a legacy of tenacious empathy for dead migrant workers.",
            "This doc attempts to put a human face on the statistics, not only following the grisly day-to-day of American officials dealing with the bodies, but also exploring the dead man's rural Honduran background. ",
            "With its compellingly multifaceted approach, its earnest compassion and a celebrity presence in the form of the actor Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, the documentary could be enlisted in the perennial battle over immigration law.",
            "The results are poignant, yet show the difficulties of applying fiction templates to true stories.",
            "While Bernal's name is an immeasurable asset to getting a project like this out there, his presence is about as equally detrimental to the success of the end result. ",
            "The cinematography is superb. The reconstruction of the journey includes breathtaking imagery of the harsh landscape the migrants are up against as well as stunning footage of young men riding atop a train...",
            "But while the film has some truly poignant moments, especially when we hear more from the family John Doe left behind in their own words, the film still struggles to find a singular voice.",
            "Who is Dayani Cristal? marks an accomplished sophomore feature film for Silver that is sure to upset and compel in equal measure. ",
            "...tackles some of the more difficult aspects of U.S. immigration policy. Bernal's portions are less compelling than the more strict reportage, but illuminating all the same.",
            "It gets at the heart. But we also learn sober truths.",
            "Actor-producer Gael Garcia Bernal takes a strikingly complex look at the timely issue of human migration from Central America to the United States, which is rarely depicted with such honest humanity.",
            "The man, whose chest is tattooed with the name Dayani Cristal, may be a victim of circumstance, but he is also treated by the filmmakers as a hero on a quest.",
            "Bernal does his best to bring the film's detective work alive, but the presence of a big star somewhat overbalances this tragic story.",
            "The ill-conceived structure and Bernal's anomalous presence sadly diminishes the impact of the material.",
            "Part detective story, part earnest inquiry into a human rights crisis, Marc Silver's documentary is correctly outraged, if sometimes lacking focus.",
            "Bernal seems sincere but he's playing a role he can step out of, which distracts from Silver's deeper ambitions: to humanise and anatomise a heated political issue.",
            "The focus of the film may be the deadly dangers of illegal border crossings, but its true subject is ordinary people and the things they'll do for the ones they love.",
            "A heart-wrenching documentary that reenacts the journey of a Honduras migrant who died in the Arizona desert and the compassionate actions of those who identified his body and provided closure for his family.",
            "The cinematography is exquisite and sometimes it alone moves the story.",
            "As informative, revealing, and occasionally poignant as some of the unearthed revelations are, the doc is ultimately hampered by a level of self-congratulation that nearly undoes its effectiveness as an activist polemic.",
            "A heartbreaking tale of migrants from Central America who risk their lives to cross into the U.S., some dying annually in the Arizona desert.",
            "Immigration has been a hot-button subject matter for film, especially the kind of doc films that play at Sundance, for years. The problem with Who is Dayani Cristal? is that it simply doesn't add enough to the conversation to make it memorable. "

            "It is especially impressive that Days of Future Past is a success; a film this gooey and complex, with such business-minded scope, should not feel like a real movie at all. ",
            "Here's the thing about comic book heroes. Despite all the noble talk about metaphors, idealism, truth and justice, they're basically just bully-boy fantasies of limitless male aggression... The X-Men, however, have always aspired to something different.",
            "Much of this takes place in the early 1970s, which gives the filmmakers an excuse to haul out lots of vintage kitsch and make some rather tasteless references to the Vietnam war.",
            "The results are both dazzling and intimate, clever and - during one tour-de-force sequence - spectacularly funny.",
            "I would be remiss not to note that tucked away amid all the existential melodrama is perhaps the most hilarious set piece ever to grace a superhero film.",
            "Quicksilver ... is the coolest of this picture's new guys, zipping around so fast ... that he can taste soup, rearrange guards' limbs, and nudge bullets off their trajectories all in the time it takes to blink.",

            "It acts as a jumpstart to a series that needed fresh legs to stand on.",
            "X-Men: Days of Future Past is a rollercoaster of an epic film and towards the end (without realising it), I started becoming emotional. ",
            "Epic and wide reaching, Days of Future Past is a solid follow up to First Class, but a number flaws keep it from being one of the best of the franchise.",
            "X-Men: Days of Future Past is another great entry in a series that has had its highs and lows.",
            "Sometimes it's gloomy, but most of the time the humorous moments, the wide cast and the action sequences make X-Men: Days of Future Past devilishly entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Despite being plagued by some familiar problems in Bryan Singer's X-Men movies, this thrilling time-travelling adventure combines the casts of two eras of the franchise for possibly the best instalment yet. ",
            "One of the stronger comic book films to emerge from Marvel.",
            "Days of Future Past is easily the best X-Men film since X2. ",
            "X-Men: Days of Future Past sticks its fingers in its ears and yells \"nananana I can't hear you\" when it comes to preserving the continuity of a film series that has been drudging on for a mind-numbing 14 years now.",
            "Every moviemaking dime spent seems to show onscreen.",
            "It's one of the best times you're likely to have in a theater this year. It doesn't make a ton of sense, but it doesn't always have to. It's the X-Men.",

            "If X-Men was about coming out of the closet, X2 about unity, X3 about fear-mongering, and First Class about brotherhood, X:Men Days of Future Past is all about course correction. ",
            "X-Men: Days of Future Past is certainly one of the best films in the entire X-Men series and unites both the new and old casts with stakes on the line.",
            "Impressive for the most part without being awe-inspiring, the film's two timelines converge in a much more satisfying and thrilling ways towards the end, where the emotional stakes are considerably upped. ",
            "The excellent script by Simon Kinberg, and the assured direction by Singer, ensure that each character does their job, and never feels extraneous."

            "An effective cinematic way to approach art; not as a Ken Burns panning motion across a single image, but as a series of static and dolly shots to give the viewer time to take in the work, and also to move around it.",
            "It's an informative film, rich in ideas because LeWitt's ideas are rich, but it didn't make me curious either to see more of his work or know more about this oddly nebulous figure.",
            "Though not dissimilar to other documentaries about artists, Sol LeWitt somehow feels much fresher and more original than those other productions and will hopefully catch on beyond fine-art enthusiasts.",
            "What first feels like a neurotic avoidance of Sol LeWitt the man instead becomes a kind of mirage of his life, as though he managed to evaporate into his body of work. ",
            "Teerink's reserved, spare form mirrors LeWitt's work, which gives it tremendous impact."

            "Before I Disappear is ultimately hampered not by a messy plot but by bland characters who, for the most part, don't so much talk to each other as they monologue at each other.",
            "It has the unfortunate taste of something lean that's been plumped up with empty calories.",
            "\"Before I Disappear\" wears its big, aching heart on its sleeve with a sincerity so unwavering that it's borderline goofy. And in a film about a burnout bonding with a cute kid, that lack of self-awareness proves critical.",
            "Throughout the movie, you have the feeling of being dragged along on an impromptu journey by a filmmaker who is traveling without the benefit of a GPS device.",
            "It's hard to take hectoring parent Emmy Rossum seriously, and there's too much troubling development tucked into a plot that already feels overextended. A surfeit of last-act explanations doesn't help either.",
            "It's a tale that requires a strong, emotional component to be successful, and its glaring absence only becomes more and more apparent.",
            "For all its dark humor and dire situations, Before I Disappear conveys that a little forgiveness and a little time with someone who cares can bring a little hope before it's too late.",
            "This is a humorous, emotional and engrossing film.",
            "The result of this is Before I Disappear, a darkly comic film about love and family with rich characters and an original voice.",
            "Christensen, who not only stars but writes, produces, and directs, does about a dozen things simultaneously that most movies can't get right individually.",
            "Christensen can't settle on a satisfactory tone-mawkish one moment, menacing the next... His movie is so vehement about Richie's redemption that even its bumpy detours are dully predictable.",
            "The self-indulgent screenplay doesn't commit to its quirky deadpan humor and never generates enough narrative momentum to warrant feature expansion.",
            "\"Before I Disappear\" suffers from a bland, disinterested tone. In the end, few will care when all of these people disappear.",
            "\"Before I Disappear\" isn't a bad freshman effort, but it doesn't offer anything to set it apart from dozens of other indie dramedies.",
            "As a director, Christensen operates at two settings: Drippy Sentimentality and Miserablist Hopelessness.",
            "The 90-minute expansion of an Oscar-winning short chooses art over heart, and lacks the emotional conviction of its progenitor.",
            "Perhaps the screenplay was written to mimic the main character's doped-out dissociative state, but it feels more like a collection of disconnected set-pieces than a cohesive film of its own.",
            "What makes this minefield of sphincter-clenching sassy bons mots even harder to stomach is the uninspired photography, which impassionedly pleads for significance through use of slow motion, bokeh-effect streetlights, and close-ups.",
            "An enchanting, gritty and funny short becomes a feature film with its charms intact. ",
            "The result is predictably, frustratingly bloated and meandering, even as the short's charms remain largely intact.",
            "Even at its most compelling, it remains inconsistent and superfluous, a lesson that sometimes a movie can feel more fully formed in 19 minutes rather than 90.",
            "Before I Disappear shows a lot of promise for the cast and actor/writer/director Christensen.",
            "Although Before I Disappear bears the undeniable stamp of padding, Christensen wisely expands on the kaleidoscopic energy of the short, not its formulaic underpinnings."

            "Lewins hardly re-invents the wheel with her dutiful documentary, but the opening dialogue - between Ali, and his young daughter, Maryum - does make you shiver.",
            "The film has one piercing insight: when Ali was banned from boxing from 1967 to 1971, these were not wasted years.",
            "It doesn't break any new ground, not does it claim to, but it's likable and reasonably thorough.",
            "Unless you have an insatiable appetite for goo-goo father-daughter talks, the recordings are tedious.",

            "Overall I Am Ali is a great film about a very influential person that inspired a lot of people all across the globe. I Am Ali is something that should be seen and shown to as many people as possible who don't know Muhammad Ali.",
            "[W]hat sets this documentary apart are the interviews with two of Ali's daughters, Hana and Maryum, as well as son Muhammad Jr. and one of his ex-wives, and the inclusion of excerpts of audio tapes made by Ali himself over the years.",
            "Retracing Muhammad Ali's vibrant life is an opportunity for audiences to reexamine American history, race relations, the civil rights movement, the antiwar movement and the sports world through the eyes of a perceptive black man.",
            "Well-trodden territory, but come on, it's Ali- you probably couldn't make a boring doc about him if you tried.",
            "Conclusive proof that it is impossible to make a boring documentary about Muhammad Ali. Mind you, the folk behind this lacklustre hagiography have certainly tried their hardest. ",
            "Very much a celebratory piece that revels in Muhammad Ali's artistry, rather than offering an objective, impartial study of the boxer's quite incredible life.",
            "The word 'icon' is overused but as this charming Muhammad Ali portrait shows, occasionally it's utterly warranted.",
            "Packed with never-released material, this documentary tells the life story of Muhammad Ali from angles we haven't seen before, even as it has a tendency to drift into hero worship.",
            "Any movie about one of sport's most intriguing and heroic characters is never going to be dull.",
            "There have been far more detailed and objective examinations, most notably William Klein's Muhammad Ali, the Greatest, but I Am Ali at least gives a fascinating glimpse into the private side of one of history's most public personalities.",
            "The movie loses momentum the more it relies on what is supposed to be its novel aspect, the participation of Ali family members. The hagiography becomes tiresome...",
            "I Am Ali's contributions to the mountain of extant Ali scholarship are slight, but the privilege of eavesdropping on a man who inspired so many while he asks his little girl Maryum if she's yet determined her purpose on Earth is not.",
            "I Am Ali may not be the definitive look at an incredibly charismatic athlete, but it does provide authentic insights and observations from the family he raised and loved. Newcomers to the Ali legend will get a good idea of further areas they can explore.",
            "\"I Am Ali\" merely reminds us of the boxer's appeal, without adding to our understanding.",
            "A composite portrait of a complicated figure. ... Lewins' film is an affectionate series of memories, as recalled by Ali's family and associates.",

            "\"Manuscripts Don't Burn\" is one of the best films I've seen this year, and one of the hardest to watch.",

            "Rasoulof constructs a vivid portrait of a paranoid state, but he also manages to incorporate some fingernail-endangering tension into the piece.",

            "Gebbe appears to be a misanthrope who subjects her male protagonist to senseless cruelty.",

            "Ukrainian director Sergei Loznitsa's Maidan harkens back to the heroic, journalistic roots of documentary-making and yet feels ineffably modern and formally daring.",

            "But the crisp confidence shown in so much of the film, as well as its all-too-rare moral intelligence, marks Evolution of a Criminal as a highly worthy debut from a filmmaker who hopefully has more stories to tell besides his own.",

            "This is a big-tent Christian film that wriggles around a lot seeking to accommodate multiple varieties of religious experience, and ends up terminally infected with the virus of postmodern relativism.",
            "A well-acted, family-friendly and timely movie for Easter audiences that is just as much about appreciating life on Earth as it is about what comes after.",
            "There's no antagonist, no resolution, and no real climax - just a series of mildly charming scenes in which Colton shares heavenly knowledge while his family reacts with awestruck tears.",
            "Kinnear does an excellent job of capturing Burpo's obvious dilemma and the turmoil he and his wife endure as they work through this critical time in the life of their family.",
            "2014 is proving to be the year that faith-based cinema is breaking out of its credible indie vibe and sweeping into wide release mode.",
            "The script stumbles a few times and is a bit too wordy, but the strong acting makes up for it. This is a feel-good family film that just may cause you to shed a tear or two...",
            "Despite its many good points, Heaven is for Real can't escape its limitations, and does at times feel like a TV movie of the week. It is an intriguing story, yet it fails to analyze the issues at hand in any depth.",
            "Presents some compelling theological arguments with a first-rate cast and, for the most part, good direction.",
            "[Heaven is for Real] is simply a good, old-fashioned film the entire family can enjoy and maybe, just maybe, it could spark some insightful conversation.",

            "It never strays far from preaching, leaving viewers no choice but to see Pastor Burpo primarily as an unreliable narrator.",
            "A smooth, easygoing film that will please its target audience, even if it doesn't quite reach the heavenly heights of other inspirational efforts in the faith-based genre.",
            "It's really just more numbing propaganda.",
            "Christians may shout hallelujah that faith-based films are arriving in theaters, but believers should pray for something much better.",
            "While the film makes decent use of the plains of Nebraska to give us a portrait of smalltown Red States America, there's a hectoring, insincere feel to this project that renders it practically unwatchable.",

            "...will no doubt fill a niche, but a more satisfying movie could have been made had the filmmakers followed Iris DeMent's advice and simply let the mystery be."

            "Aside from the rampaging kangaroo and burning pirate shirt, \"Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day\" emphasizes relatable humor families can connect to over slapsticky gimmicks and cheap laughs.",

            "I found it genuinely adorable and entertaining.",
            "Alexander... etc. isn't exactly a terrible film, but it was definitely in need of a little retooling so that the events plaguing this family weren't quite so unbelievable, annoying, and on the lower end of the comic scale.",
            "Alexander is funnier than one would expect. In a weird way, it's full of refreshingly cranky, dorky goofing.",

            "The movie's principal intention is to make you laugh at a loser, and revel in scenes from which polite people would instinctively turn away.",

            "McCarthy's performance of unself-conscious uncouthness celebrates the freedom to be undignified. And, still, it's being misused.",
            "It's a film that is constantly flirting with the idea that it's going to be something truly special and it just never gets there.",

            "Tammy is authentically entertaining and McCarthy and Sarandon are total queens and you'll fall in love.",
            "I call this a typical summer-house movie: films stars do because they fancy a fourth home in Napa.",
            "Presumably to expand her (McCarthy's) repertoire, there is a deliberate attempt to cut down her sweat-slob persona and soften those rough edges to test new ground here that is akin to inventing a humanitarian nuclear bomb.",
            "Only two people were asleep when I went to go see Tammy, but by the time I left, all of us were unconscious. Helpless dogs trapped in a dark purse of a movie.",
            "While the effort can be appreciated, the vehicle was running on fumes from the start.",

            "It drags and it befuddles, but like most McCarthy properties, Tammy sings when she's onscreen. Worth the bumps.",
            "'Tammy' is a disappointment, because it asks an energetic, unpredictable performer to play it so calculatingly, frustratingly safe.",
            "Ultimately, the entire film plays like a 100-minute deleted scene - shaggy, formless, and voraciously inconsequential.",

            "The film deftly pokes fun at the foibles of earthlings -- especially their warring religions -- with warmth and compassion, and shines a light on the contradictions of India's strict but unwritten social rules.",
            "A biting, whip-smart satire on the thorny subject of organized religion, the Bollywood musical \"PK\" enlightens and provokes through outrageous slapstick.",
            "Mr. Hirani remains an excellent storyteller, weaving his disparate story strands into a convincing, satisfying whole - a rare Bollywood feat.",
            "Rajkumar Hirani and Aamir Khan are an exceptionally potent team.",
            "Watch this film if you are a Khan fan and want to learn a thing or two about religious tolerance without making it a bitter pill for viewers.",
            "This is perhaps the weakest of Hirani's films. His trademark humour is sparse; and inspite of Anushka Sharma's spirited portrayal of a reporter who helps PK, and Khan's over-earnest performance as the protagonist, the film is a tedious watch.",
            "Good intentions don't automatically translate into absorbing cinema.",
            "The film tries so hard to be smart and funny, but... PK offers a metaphor that's too simplistic to be taken seriously.",
            "A romantic/ sci-fi/ musical comedy that touches on philosophical themes with lots of irony. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "This entertaining Bollywood musical is so relentlessly buoyant in its charge to ask the big questions it comes close to reaching an epiphany.",
            "A bold exploration of religion wrapped in a sci-fi drama with several moments of broad comedy thrown in to lighten the mood -- after all, it is Bollywood. ",
            "Never preachy or high-handed, the filmmaker is an expert at presenting complicated concepts in the simplest of ways.",
            "P.K. is a landmark film that has come out at a relevant time in the current Indian and global political climate. Go see it and reflect on the difference between faith and religion.",
            "There are some very powerful scenes in the film that will make you cry, uneasy in seat, and even laugh sheepishly at times.",
            "The focus... gets diluted by a wholly superfluous romance (and songs, tuneful as a couple are), and a face-off between the guy awash in goodness who asks all the right questions and the bad godman who has all the wrong answers.",
            "I can think of nobody but Aamir Khan as PK, and nobody but Rajkumar Hirani as our teacher.",
            "PK is as much a philosophy as a film.",
            "Rajkumar Hirani's first film in five years is a warm, funny and piercingly provocative satire that should blow the blues away.",
            "This is his most controversial film, but he delivers it with the same humour and emotional insight that he showed in 3 Idiots.",
            "For once with an Aamir Khan vehicle, what is most memorable is not his predictably strong performance, but material and execution as fearless as he is.",
            "If you like your social criticism slathered with schmaltz, PK fits the bill."

            "John Wick works because of its sleek, artisanal dovetailing of style and sincerity.",

            "Just when you have all but given up hope for Keanu Reeves... there comes the hyper-stylised revenge movie John Wick. And you remember what you loved about him in the first place.",
            "A pretty humourless and violent film, which grinds on and on with more and more gleaming black SUVs getting trashed.",
            "It's not perfect. But it is special, especially for a mid-budget Hollywood action drama, and it has stuck firmly in my mind since that late-night screening last Friday.",
            "Stahelski and Leitch, both former stunt men, unsurprisingly tackle action sequences with glee... but the quieter scenes are more sophisticated, incorporating a sense of fantasy and visual splendor that almost makes the wafer-thin plot feel fresh. ",
            "For a dour narrative about death, loss, and violence, it's surprisingly good natured.",
            "Just when i thought that Keanu Reeves had retired from the action genre, he appears back and in revenge mode with the amazing John Wick. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "John Wick is the slick, empty, cruel hero the age of Trump deserves - but hey, at least he likes dogs!",
            "Occasionally ridiculous, it is action-packed, stylish and a return to form for Mr Reeves.",
            "The script defines an amazing microcosm that surrounds the profession of the protagonist. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Simply put, John Wick is probably one of the best action movies in a decade. From an efficient story to incredible fight sequences and an action start that just doesn't seem to quite, John Wick is as close to perfect as I've ever seen. ",
            "Directed by long-time stuntmen David Leitch and Chad Stahelski, it is exactly the sort of movie you would expect from long-time stuntmen: brutal, close-up fighting, nearly nonstop gunplay and the slightest story legally allowed.",
            "Why does it work? That's probably a better question. On paper, this movie falls somewhere between Commando and Taken in terms of getting from Point A to Point B, but in execution, John Wick just feels like a special journey.",
            "Fast, fun, and with care taken on elements outside of the requisite action sequences, it's a film that succeeds in generally conquering the fatigue of its own familiarity.",
            "John Wick is the sort of mindless movie that you get when you give two long-time stunt men (David Leitch and Chad Stahelski) the directorial reins.",
            "Once the wick is lit (pun, unfortunately, intended), the candle of vengeance burns for the entirety of the film. ",
            "A perfectly assembled cast and confident direction turn this B-movie thriller into an instant classic. ",
            "John Wick is a lean, mean revenger to go with its ice-cold protagonist. It's not perfect, but you'll be hard pressed to find a more enjoyable action movie this year.",
            "On paper, there are many elements in this movie's plot which you have seen before in other films. However, directors David Leitch and Chad Stahlelski still manage to weave an entertaining non-stop action film.",
            "...my truly guilty pleasure of the year.",
            "An ex-hitman and his dog, who has such a sad plot-line I'm not even going to delve into the question of whether you should give someone a pet as a present. The violence is a murderous ballet, in a compelling underground world of self-contained perfection.",
            "This movie is great. It is what it is: just an old-school shoot-'em-up revenge flick. The action is incredible, and Reeves is phenomenal.",
            "John Wick is a fun action spectacle with a pulse-pounding score that is smart enough to cast an actor against type who is committed completely to this abusive insanity. "

            "Not the star of the franchise, \"Muppets Most Wanted\" is still far better than most family films out there, and is definitely one you can enjoy right alongside your kids. ",
            "Muppets Most Wanted is a fun Muppet movie, despite the fact that it sometimes feels like they're trying too hard",
            "We wanted them. We got them. The Muppets are back again with a vengeance with Muppets Most Wanted. Please sirs, I want some more.",

            "Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie and the gang are as sweet as ever, but as far as the human actors go, cutesy has been replaced by snarky in Disney's newest Muppets film, Muppets Most Wanted.",
            "Children and adults will undoubtedly enjoy the film.",
            "This follow-up to the delightful 2011 reboot is only a shadow of that film, with some mild fun but never the same manic energy that made the previous film such a joy.",

            "It's interesting to make a driven young female the focus of the narrative, but the cloying narcissism on display will soon have sane people - of all ages - wanting to give up the ghost.",
            "No matter how hard it tries, it just won't make you cry.",
            "The film gets by on the quality of its cast and the predictable yet fundamentally warm nature of its material.",
            "Disappointingly little of the rock and classical music shot through the novel is utilised; instead clich\u00e9d scoring, familiar dialogue and minimal chemistry between Moretz and Blackley renders Cutler's film far less engaging than its source material.",
            "Hollywood feeding the cash cow. I know it, but I don't have to like it....or the maddening mess of a movie that is IF I STAY.",
            "While she [Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz] is consistently strong throughout and is more than capable of carrying the film, the material bogs her down at moments with its tendency towards the mawkish and its obvious pitfalls.",
            "What makes \"If I Stay\" a pleasant surprise is Moretz. She is so convincing here, delivering a performance that overcomes the moments when the film could have easily spiraled into Lifetime movie-level melodrama.",
            "While If I Stay hopefully teaches no one lessons about romance, it does teach something beautiful about love.",
            "Overall, we feel like we're being told a story...rather than being immersed in an experience. Moretz pours heart and soul into her self-immersed character, but this isn't quite enough to make If I Stay work on other levels.",
            "The story's na\u00efvet\u00e9 is matched only by its dullness.",

            "Not only did I love every silly, gothic, gorgeous minute of Guillermo del Toro's Crimson Peak, I'm actually suspicious of those who didn't.",
            "Crimson Peak is an effort to make a throwback movie with modern effects and modern sex scenes, but it can't contend with the modern gaze with which we're looking at it.",
            "Del Toro builds a tight plot but never develops it; his frames are overdecorated with macabre clutter and smothered in shadow, but the atmosphere of dread never reaches ecstatic excesses.",
            "All the carefully orchestrated color schemes and all the dark corridors and secret chambers and all the flowing red metaphors in the world can't accelerate the slow patches, or make us care about lead characters.",
            "The real wonder is the sumptuous production design by Thomas E. Sanders, whose darkly colorful sets were inspired by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining.",
            "Del Toro just goes for effect, and the effect he seems to be going for here is something like, \"Ew, Guillermo, that's really gross.\"",
            "While the love/hate relationship audiences had with CRIMSON PEAK delivered a middling worldwide box office for the film, I contend that not only is it one of the best haunted house movies of all time but ranks as Guillermo Del Toro's true masterpiece.",
            "Sure, Del Toro's usual flair for grotesque visuals is apparent, though these spiritual permutations sometimes feel too over-the-top for a narrative that justifies a YA range of intellect.",
            "I felt like I was on a ride with a storyteller who knew exactly what he was doing.",
            "A melodramatic gothic romance mystery that's as unusual and compelling as that sounds.",
            "Crimson Peak is a fantastic gothic romance that's filled with plenty of mystery, punctuated with several bumps in the night.",
            "A spectacle that does not hold any surprises and that fails in its ability to keep in suspense. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "If Merchant-Ivory made a horror film it would look something like this.",
            "There's nothing else like it out right now, and if you've got an inner Goth or English major, this will be right up your alley. It's utterly unique, and could only have been made by Guillermo del Toro.",
            "There are so many holes in [the] story, I just don't think it's salvageable.",
            "Overall, Crimson Peak is gorgeous to look at, but is ultimately let down by its half-baked plot.",
            "Crimson Peak is visually stunning and offers sophisticated performances but the tragic story won't be remembered for its content as much as its presentation. ",
            "The greatness and failure of Crimson Peak as a film are altogether at war with each other.",
            "The master of magic has created something wonderful to look at but emotionally null and void.",
            "Thoroughly engaging, del Toro delivers a stylistically classy film that is sure to please.",
            "Each of the actors handles the drama with aplomb, and they sell the fright with vigor - especially Chastain, who gives a stirring performance as a grave woman whose grating demeanor suggests a cat with ready claws. ",
            "I unapologetically LOVE Crimson Peak for everything that it is ... yes, even Charlie Hunnam as Edith's sad-eyed, shafted suitor. Incredible, I know. ",
            "Nothing, however, could distract from the stunningly detailed gothic imagery which, like in many del Toro pictures, supersedes everything else.",
            "It's all a little over the top, at times, but that's all part of the fun and del Toro sustains the interest throughout."

            "Almost no one in this film is allowed to play to their strengths.",

            "It's not a soulless remake, but it's definitely a watered down one. ",
            "The story is laughable, the plot unbelievable, and the characterizations so broad, if they were targets we could shoot, they'd all be dead in the first five minutes.",

            "Steer well clear.",
            "Favouring vitality over originality, this needless remake of District 13 comes with fleet-footed sequences but plenty of stumbles, and strains far too hard to be 'cool'.",
            "It's solidly unsurprising (and often quite boring) generic fare, spiced up with steroidal pectorals and fetishy catfights.",
            "Watching Belle perform his gravity-defying leaps and bounds is still exhilarating, but first-time director Camille Delamarre's overuse of slo-mo effects and flashy editing diminishes their impact.",
            "It's so forgettable though that if you do see it you may want to make note of the title so that you don't accidentally rent it when it comes out on DVD.",
            "Too much muscle-headed action, too little parkour (Belle is getting on a bit) - this property is condemned.",
            "There are gunfights and car chases galore, but none of them are especially exciting since the film's characters are so lazily sketched."

            "This is a movie that needs to remove a piece of jewelry.",
            "The trouble with director Marc Webb's disappointing sequel is it wants to have it both ways: to take seriously human connection and loss and also spin the spectacular and pulpy... Spider-Man 2 never locates that sweet spot.",
            "The studios and the producers have to split the difference -- between excellence and adequacy, between darkness and light, between seriousness and fun. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 might have been split too far. It doesn't taste like anything.",
            "The Amazing Spider-Man 2 isn't the perfect Spider-Man film.",
            "The major problem with The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is that it has a convoluted and unbalanced plot, clearly not learning its lessons from Spider-Man 3 about having too many villains in one film. ",
            "The Amazing Spider-Man 2 works best when Peter isn't wearing the trademark red and blue suit, when he's just being a kid. The superhero side, however, falls short.",
            "There isn't that one obvious thing that doesn't work about this particular reboot. It's a lot of tiny things that don't work feeding into a tributary system of things that don't work, which eventually dumps into an entire ocean of not working.",
            "With appalling dialogue, slapstick humour, some bizarre aesthetics, and cheesy moments aplenty (Peter's Spider-Man theme ringtone or Electro beating Spidey up to the tune of \"Incy Wincy Spider\"), this is the Batman & Robin of the Spider-Man franchise.",
            "While The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is still more charming than The Avengers, it falls prey of trying to do too much.",

            "It's fun, but nothing more.",
            "While it shares problems with its predecessor, it also confirms Garfield as the very best big screen iteration of Spidey. What's more, there's even perhaps an argument that he's the strongest of all of Marvel's movie misfits.",
            "The fifth web slinger film since 2002 (the second in this reboot) is overstuffed with plot threads flying everywhere, but there is just enough there to keep the series alive.",
            "The movie may be lacking focus, overstuffed and overlong (2.5 hours), but I didn't find the changing tone distracting.",
            "Is The Amazing Spider-Man 2 worth watching? Yes, especially on the big screen, when we can feel ourselves flying along. Amazing may be overstating the movie's impact, though. ",
            "There's no driving style behind it, just a lot of white noise and cues for comics fans to slurp up.",

            "Ultimately, despite a handful of fairly amusing moments, this is a disappointing comedy, suffering from a surfeit of characters. Still, at least it's mercifully shorter than the first movie.",
            "Pretends to be a post-racial couples' night gone wild, but it's chock-filled with retrograde gender stereotypes-when the camera's not ogling Vegas. Also offers lazy mocking of foreign accents and a homophobic 'joke' about a short-haired woman in a cell.",

            "Fans will enjoy slightly less funny, still risque sequel.",
            "As it stands, the flick is too good-natured and too clean to offer audiences anything more than a mild afternoon distraction.",

            "A scattered, haphazard, thoroughly confused film that can't figure out if it's meant to be a winningly cutesy musical or a gritty narrative about life in crime-ridden 1950s New Jersey.",
            "Christopher Walken plays a gangster who can fix anything; maybe he should have taken charge of the film.",
            "It's just that there's a particular combination of looseness, swagger, camaraderie, melancholy and melody in the last sequence; the film itself is solid and entertaining, but right at the end it all comes together in a moment of imaginative flight.",
            "Jersey Boys comes to life only toward the end.",
            "It's glossy and entertaining but also safe and conventional. If my father had lived to age 72, he would have loved this movie. This is your target audience.",
            "At times the movie version of \"Jersey Boys\" captures the electric excitement of the musical, but for every soaring moment, there are 10 minutes of bickering or brooding.",
            "You'll likely be so caught up in the film's catchy music and spirit that you won't much mind occasional liberties and factual errors. ",
            "It made me like the Four Seasons less",
            "It's Debbie Downer does broadway",
            "An American Dream story with an authentic period piece feel due to clever filmmaking.",
            "Whatever you call it, it operates under the same purpose as trying to fit a donut through a keyhole.",
            "Clint Eastwood's cinematic treatment of musical Jersey Boys plays it safe in nearly every possible regard. ",
            "This well-crafted screen adaptation is not about to let the hits (Sherry, Oh What a Night, Big Girls Don't Cry etc.) do all the heavy lifting, allowing the storytelling to get off lightly.",
            "Jersey Boys is almost frustrating in a way. The entire time we are aching for the film to wow us. Sadly, it never really does. ",
            "Yes, there's no Eastwood stamp stylistically, but he directs superb performances from the central quartet - and commendably without a whiff of jazz hands.",
            "A largely dull music industry saga, more TV movie than vibrant celebration of American youth culture.",
            "The four protagonists, led by Young... simply shine. They create spot-on covers of the original songs and there is no denying their musical nous, harmonious singing voices and energy of their performances.",
            "Eastwood's Jersey Boys has its flaws... But, there's still the music.",
            "Young reprises his Broadway role and is adequate, but like the rest of the film it's a performance that never quite provides an emotional investment for the audience.",
            "The music is great and there are even a few goose-bump moments when Frankie teams up with his writing partner and they try out a new hit. Nevertheless, when the music isn't playing, the film is nothing more than a cursory timeline of the group.",
            "Sinks as if it had concrete blocks tied to its windpipes. ",
            "The cast makes the most of every musical moment, singing their hearts out while doing a dance line number that the Four Seasons never actually used but should have; its powerful stuff, not just in terms of nostalgia, it's kinda sexy.",
            "What's interesting is how Eastwood breaks with genre conventions and reinvents the musical as a character study, placing the emotional drama at the forefront, with the songs almost coming as a by-product.",
            "The most likeable element in the film is not the people but the earworm-quality songs which, even after all this time, sound fresh and irresistibly catchy. You will hum Sherry for hours after the credits roll."

            "David Oyelowo breathes such life into it and makes you feel like you're seeing this person for the first time.",
            "It's extremely difficult to portray a legendary historical figure in a way that does justice to both that figure's momentousness and his humanity, but Oyelowo has found a way to do it.",
            "Even if DuVernay stumbles a bit when it comes to political sausage-making (really, who knows?), the film is dramatically tight and emotionally true.",
            "In some ways it's beyond criticism as the first-ever major movie about this heroic campaigner.",
            "Truly a film that must be seen by today's youth so that we can keep Selma and Ferguson from happening in the future.",

            "In bringing together the personal, the political, and the historic, DuVernay has crafted a film that will be remembered and studied for years to come.",
            "...offering not only a superbly-realized presentation of a particular series of events, but also a sense of what it meant to live through the historical period in question. ",
            "It's the weight of history that gives Selma so much emotional heft.",
            "...[I]n zooming in on one moment, director DuVernay and writer Paul Webb really force us to live in the trial by fire that was the American South in 1965.",
            "As director, DuVernay employs a style of storytelling... that makes it possible for audiences to find the film engrossing, entertaining, and educational.",
            "Selma is spectacularly staged, impressively acted and narratively satisfying. But it is also something much, much more and we need much, much more like it.",
            "Selma tells a great story about a triumphant moment in civil rights history and the losses it took to get that win, but it doesn't nostalgically let us forget that this moment is just a chapter break in a longer war that still rages on today.",
            "There is nothing saccharine about Selma. DuVernay does justice to the illustrious subject matter... and that's no mean feat.",
            "A very satisfying picture.",
            "In a time where dedicated activists are speaking their own truths to leaders who are often even less responsive, movies such as Selma feel more essential than ever.",

            "Selma serves as a pointed and poignant riposte to our current historical moment. It's an important film about an important story. It deserves to be seen, shared, discussed, and, like the events it depicts, never forgotten.",
            "What makes Selma a truly fine film is the imagery we see.",
            "Director Ava DuVernay has crafted an impressive film that doesn't just chronicle the events in Selma, but serves as an impressive portrait of King both as a leader in the civil rights movement and a flawed family man."

            "Despite the campus setting, little about the story is intelligently designed.",
            "Any just God would likely recoil from the ham-fisted and spurious defense put forth in this film.",
            "Even by the rather lax standards of the Christian film industry, God's Not Dead is a disaster.",
            "The film is slickly produced, with a competent cast, and although it sometimes stacks the deck shamelessly in defense of its credo, it does allow a few dissenting voices to slip into the debate.",
            "The Almighty deserves better advocacy than he gets in this typically ham-fisted Christian campus melodrama.",
            "...acting was mediocre but all the lead characters I believe did their best in portraying the roles they had been tasked to play. ",
            "It's a film by Christians for Christians.",
            "The film wants to use science to prove the existence of God while also debunking all science and discrediting all scientists. ",
            "The result is a film that is terribly one-sided and in many ways off-putting despite the promise to provoke debate.",
            "Its ineptitude at depicting recognisable human behavior is matched only by its ineptitude at following any known rules of narrative.",
            "God's Not Dead, despite excellent production values, leaves scant room for the imagination or mystery. It is a contrived, implausible Sunday school lesson...God, whom people seem to think needs defending, deserves better from the artistic community.",
            "This is awful filmmaking, from trite writing of one-dimensional characters to even triter (which spell-check is telling me is not a word) dialogue.",
            "Will likely get a mildly, if unenthusiastic, passing grade from its target audience, but for the non-believers, it's going to prove a tough and condescending experience.",
            "Has a decided agenda but still manages to be entertaining",
            "Lambasts reason, and celebrates Christianity unabashedly, which is a shame, because it has an opportunity to really challenge its target audience. ",
            "Continually, I bemoan the fact that viewers of faith - and I'm among them - are under-served when it comes to high-quality faith-based films.",
            "The prostelytizing concept immediately loses credibility because no teacher at a legitimate academic institution would make that demand, augmenting it with threat of failure.",
            "Teen-friendly, faith-based movie is heavy on dogma.",
            "Dubious religious content aside, God's Not Dead is, above all, a dismal piece of filmmaking.",
            "It's not just bad filmmaking; it's bad Christianity.",
            "God may not be dead, but I'd be willing to wager this movie at least gave him a faint wave of nausea.",
            "While it most certainly has some very good qualities, it is ultimately undone - at least for general audiences - by a completely unsubtle desire to do more than simply tell a meaningful story; it wants to rock the world. ",
