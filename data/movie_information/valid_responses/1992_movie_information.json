            "Massoud's parkour-practising Aladdin and Naomi Scott's glass-ceiling-smashing Princess Jasmine aren't really allowed space to develop readings of the roles when Smith is due to pop out of a lamp at any moment to murder a song or flog a comedy routine",
            "Disney's remake of  Aladdin  features human actors and digital creatures, but don't call it \"live-action.\" Maladroit and overlong, its resting state is moribund.",
            "Aladdin wasn't perfect, but nothing will ever live up to the classic '92 version. Still, if you have a kiddo, or if you're still a big kid at heart, we certainly recommend it.",
            "Visually, this is a stunning feat along with incredible action stunts and choreography.",
            "Aladdin is much like its protagonist; flawed, a little clumsy, but ultimately quite winning; a diamond in the rough.",
            "It is nonsense that tests my patience quota for two eternally boring hours. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "A nostalgic magic carpet ride that might not be \"a whole new world\" of original filmmaking, but is a welcome familiar world after the depressing downer \"Dumbo\" (2019).",
            "Ritchie leaves behind his trademark slow downed style of editing in favour of some questionable speeded up dance sequences which look cheap and badly edited in the flamboyancy of imagination clearly taken from Bollywood.",
            "The production was so focused on making us remember the past that it did little to make the present memorable. ",
            "This is one film that we would watch for the sake of it but come out of the theatre wishing for the good ol' days.",
            "Sure, it's almost exactly like the animated version, but they gave Jasmine the feminist edge that was sorely lacking in the cartoon.",
            "This live-action version of the Disney animated classic does a very good job capturing most of what made the original magical ... while expanding on the story and the characters.",
            "Will Smith puts a fun spin on proceedings. He brings his \"A\" game, which we haven't seen in some of his recent outings.",
            "Aladdin shows superior technical craftsmanship in so many aspects of the film, but its failure to reckon with a change of medium, bungling of story, and underwhelming characters, means that it is ultimately unsatisfying.",
            "An unimaginative remake that can be entertaining but feels empty and forgettable.",
            "There's enough here to make the film stand out on its own. Whether it stands out for the right reasons is up to the viewer. ",
            " An unsubtle, fast-moving film with plenty of jokes and a visual style that would suit a themed Las Vegas hotel, it's certainly not an all-time Disney great, but I can see it being a half-term hit.",
            "The design is gawdy without the joy of camp. The pacing is manic. The editing is bizarre.",
            "You can never unsee dance sequences directed by Guy Ritchie.",
            "My wish is that this would have been a better movie. The Disney whimsy and magic is lacking in Aladdin.",
            "Thankfully, Aladdin is not a shot-for-shot remake, which gives Ritchie room to provide his own unique take. In turn, he incorporates little touches amid clever chase scenes and entertaining dialogue to lift the film. "

            "It's not politically correct. It's also not cinematically correct, humanly correct or historically correct.",
            "Released in 1,492 theaters on Friday, Christopher Columbus: The Discovery should be gone from most of them faster than you can hoist the mainsails and shiver your timbers.",
            "Cast in the title role is George Corraface, whose credits include Not Without My Daughter and Impromptu. Does he overact? Let's just say that I think I heard him frown.",
            "The film benefits greatly from the use of three totally authentic ship replicas, but the real thing -- as presented in the PBS series about Columbus -- is still much more inspiring.",
            "George Corraface would look more comfortable in a Calvin Klein underwear ad than at the helm of a ship.",
            "Christopher Columbus: The Discovery lacks even the misplaced energy of a camp folly. It's limp and exhausted -- a bloodless swashbuckler. ",
            "Dry as an outdated textbook, scintillating as the droning of your worst schoolteacher, Christopher Columbus: The Discovery is a colossal disaster.",
            "This daft biographical epic reveals that the Europeans came West in search of many things: a new trade route to India and China; new souls to be converted to Christianity; new sources of gold; and new girlfriends with larger breasts.",
            "Most of the picture is so hilariously Hollywooden that nobody could mistake it for real history.",
            "All right, maybe the world isn't flat. But this listless historical epic sure is.",
            "This is not so much a milestone to mark the 500th anniversary of the discovery of America as a millstone round the neck of nearly everyone connected with it.",
            "Seeming to last somewhat longer than Columbus's original journey across the Atlantic, this dull and unintentionally funny turkey is best left to chronic insomniacs.",
            "The drama never catches fire, cycling through the same beats of uncertainty and blame to a point of screen stasis. The opening driving montage of Manos: The Hands of Fate has more of a filmmaking zip.",
            "John Glen's take on the Genovese explorer adds up to perfectly serviceable commercial entertainment -- there are a few moments where Kirk Douglas or Charlton Heston would have felt right at home.",
            "As a historical epic or even a gung-ho action romp, this displays little taste or spectacle and feels more interminable than Columbus' original voyage.",
            "It's hard to fathom the minds of people who could make this kind of tripe.",
            "zzzzzzzzz",
            "Expensive, sloppy and, at its most ambitious, a frail reminder of the Warner Brothers swashbucklers that Michael Curtiz used to turn out with Errol Flynn.",
            "Stagy, unconvincing, and frequently quite amusing."

            "What makes it so effectively terrifying is not an urban legend that could spark an ill-advised, teenage-led hunt nor an array of ominous visuals; it is far simpler than that. It is the thought of finding yourself in Ripley's position.",
            "the first part of the movie is essentially Marx in space, and the second part of the movie is Darwin in space.",
            "A horror masterpiece that doesn't age at all because its main theme is the fear of the unknown and that's one of the deepest fears. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "There have also been digital restorations and improvements to the original film's negative and sound mix, but the best thing about this rerelease is simply the opportunity to see the awesome Alien in theatres again."

            "David Lynch's prequel film, maligned upon its initial release, can now be seen as a hinge in his filmography - and a hint of what's to come.",
            "In its own singular, deeply strange way, Fire Walk With Me is David Lynch's masterpiece.",
            "There have always been two sides to Lynch: the inscrutable, demonic prankster and the rhapsodic dreamer. In Fire Walk With Me, he's at least trying to recover his poetic sincerity. If only his dreams weren't starting to look like reruns.",
            "At its best, it's a dream within a dream, a nightmare in endlessly reflecting pop mirrors, a screen full of TV-movie sex and horror kitsch blowing up right in our faces.",
            "In Twin Peaks the movie, all the twists get straightened out. The thrill is gone.",
            "For those who are willing to go the distance with Lynch, the return trip to Twin Peaks is well worth the trouble.",
            "Lynch explores how evil influence plays a macabre role in the corruption of goodness, of everything that is sweet and innocent.",
            "The world of Twin Peaks is dense, terrifying, and seductive all at once. Fire Walk with Me has all these trademarks but also presented the reality that David Lynch will never succumb to audience expectation, no matter how rabid they might be.",
            "Engages with the psychological onslaught of the senses that is stirred by trauma in such a furious, intimate way that... the simple act of looking at a framed image of Laura Palmer can send electricity up our spinal cords. ",
            "Weirdness abounds, but is always depicted in Lynch's highly stylized, painterly manner. He loves to dwell on images languorously, whether they are horrific or pastoral.",
            "Twin Peaks: The Return elevates FWWM from a questionably necessary prequel movie to an essential piece of a far larger and suddenly more cohesive mythology.",
            "As hard as it may be to watch, Fire Walk With Me is a beautiful, underrated movie that is essential to Twin Peaks.",
            "Not a goddamn thing happens in this movie. I actively hated it. It made me yearn for the absolute worst episode of Twin Peaks.",
            "Though a disappointment to many upon release, this looks better with the passing of time and the easing of expectations, and it looks forward to the more finely wrought nightmares and mind-warps of Lost Highway and Mulholland Dr.",
            "It's a much needed corrective on many of the show's ethical missteps (or at least shortcuts), and an absolutely essential part of the entire Twin Peaks experience.",
            "An ungainly and unnecessary prequel to the excellent TV series.",
            "A horrible masterpiece. Ugly, abstract and unrelenting, it's like having someone else's nightmare.",
            "As much an essential missing piece for audiences of David Lynch's groundbreaking 1991-'92 television series (\"Twin Peaks\") to gain closure as a stand-alone film, \"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me\" is an alternately funny, harrowing, and bizarre experience. ",
            "One of Lynch's darkest, most disturbing films precisely because it is able to delve into the places that the show simply wasn't allowed to explore on national television.",
            "A fascinating tightrope-walk: Lynch's ultra-cool unconventional storytelling techniques are modified just enough to allow the movie to reach a broad audience",
            "With typical perversity, Lynch avoids cosy closure, instead riffing on his TV themes that seem even more baffling with big-screen expansion.",
            "If you didn't get it then, you're not going to get it now.",
            "Fire Walk With Me contains not a single moment of genuinely felt emotion.",
            "For a film with a pre-established conclusion, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me seems depressingly interminable."

            "This is actually a pretty clever idea, and it's certainly ambitious -- too ambitious.",

            "And while Tarantino never quite succeeds in putting around each character the sense of isolation that marks the best noirs, he carries off this exercise in lively fashion. It's more purple than noir, but it's got juice.",
            "No one should go to Reservoir Dogs without prior thought. But what they will see is a riveting treatise on the theme of betrayal set in an urban wasteland that murders hope and makes redemption virtually impossible.",
            "As QT's first film as both writer and director, Reservoir Dogs indicates a remarkably fully formed cinematic sensibility.",
            "The exaggerated raw violence of \"Reservoir Dogs\" leaves one feeling cheated in the end. For this movie isn't really about anything. It's just a flashy, stylistically daring exercise in cinematic mayhem.",
            "Perhaps it's a bit too knowing in places, and perhaps it packs in one pop cultural reference too many, but this is an in-your-face, look-at-me kind of debut, designed to function as the calling-card of a major new talent.",
            "The film, for all its mayhem and fury, is too distant to be truly disturbing; it treats everything with an impatient, born-too-late shrug.",
            "The wafer-thin plot gets stretched far with smart, nonlinear weaves and a masterful cast crowned by Michael Madsen's trigger-happy psychopath and Lawrence Tierney's amiably gruff head honcho.",
            "An amazing narrative prodigy that is the story of a spoiled robbery which, right now, I would point out as Tarantino's masterpiece. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Tarantino's jumbling of his chronology and the clever changes of context from the claustrophobic warehouse section to various character origin flashbacks are sly and electric",
            "There are good performances all around as Reservoir Dogs veers to its ironic, almost absurdist climax. In addition to his clever plotting, Tarantino has given his cast sharp, acrid, sometimes witty dialogue.",
            "...one of the most impressive debut features in cinematic history.",
            "No matter how many times you've freeze-framed the bit at the end, it's still up there with Die Hard and Taxi Driver as one of the great once-a-year indulgences.",
            "Brash, abrasive and unrelenting, this is a must-see.",
            "This movie is not for everybody. It's for hardly anybody. Fans of this kind of paperback-style bloodbath, however, will be held by the promise of a resolution as outlandish and as the rest of the picture.",
            "The film ends without a satisfying resolution, since these characters are so ugly only an agonizing affliction would qualify as just deserts. Crime doesn't exactly pay in this case, but it doesn't cost enough either.",
            "A superb character study of tough guys turning on each other, it is also an edgy drama about the dissolution of trust.",
            "A brash, brutal crime-caper film, Reservoir Dogs has enough raw energy for 10 motion pictures and more than enough rough stuff to traumatize the sensitive. But not only does Dogs have teeth, it has brains.",
            "Tarantino's palpable enthusiasm, his unapologetic passion for what he's created, reinvigorates this venerable plot and, mayhem aside, makes it involving for longer than you might suspect.",
            "A much-acclaimed revisionist gangster film that I found to have more style than substance.",
            "Reservoir Dogs is hideously ugly in its materials, but in the sure way it's made and the vividness of the performances, it's a thing of beauty.",
            "Exuberance over violence is mostly reined in. Coiled male panic and ricocheting accusations carry the action. At its best, at a time before Tarantino became all show, Reservoir Dogs reveals masculinity as a bloody, savage, two-faced performance.",
            "Undoubtedly one of the best films of the 1990s, and probably one of the best directorial debuts of all time, Reservoir Dogs announced the arrival of one of contemporary cinema's hottest talents -- and he came out shooting.",
            "Tarantino, in Reservoir Dogs, has made a nihilist comedy about how human nature will always undercut the best-laid plans.",
            "Raw and bloody. For adults."

            "Meryl Streep shines in a glitzy black comedy, but it's still She-Devil with a make-over.",
            "The effects are awesome, if occasionally too gruesome to enjoy. All in all, however, Death Becomes Her is clever, different and dementedly entertaining, while commenting on our unhealthy obsession with youth and beauty.",

            "Quirky but enjoyable oddity.",
            "This pitch-dark comedy may be seen as a biting satire on the tendency to fetishize personal appearance and youthfulness. But its inventiveness quickly wears thin, and the filmmakers show an unhealthy fascination with the spectacle of mutilated women.",
            "Certainly, \"Death Becomes Her\" is macabre and mean. But it's also wise and cuttingly witty.",
            "Despite some clever moments, especially early on, Robert Zemeckis' new black comedy about aging, success and failure ultimately falls crashingly down -- like the catastrophes it so fondly dwells on.",
            "Zemeckis has always relished technical challenges; once again he pulls them off with high style.",
            "Streep, Hawn comically, murderously, defy age and death. ",
            "...one of the least engaging endeavors contained within Zemeckis' early filmography.",
            "The script by Martin Donovan and David Koepp never lacks for cleverness, but it's ultimately more frantic than funny.",
            "At the film's peak, Zemeckis, the cast, and the special-effects team achieve a deluxe, macabre slapstick.",
            "Highly amusing, but there's nothing to the feature beyond cheap thrills and a few laughs.",
            "The trouble with Death Becomes Her isn't that its comic vision is too dark but that it has no shadings, no acerbic glee.",
            "Mordant, daring, and way, way out there, \"Death Becomes Her\" is a very dark comedy that yields far more strange fascination than outright laughs."

            "This is bull of a very high order.",
            "Ferrara was in the right place at the right time to make Bad Lieutenant.",
            "Members of the gutter-al elite will be the sole survivors.",
            "Keitel is onscreen for pretty much the entire movie and clearly relishes the opportunity of playing someone not so much teetering on the abyss as leaping off with a grand piano manacled to each ankle.",
            "Keitel's performance is courageous, almost psychotic, because it is deeply and profoundly authentic.",
            "Ferrara uses this fictional piece to penetrate the corrupt soul of a dirty rotten cop when he is confronted with something more terrible than even himself.",
            "The greatest New York City depiction of repentance in the deepest, darkest slums of the human soul since Scorsese's \"Mean Streets.\"",
            "As emptily defiant as a bit of graffiti on the base of a dustbin.",
            "Bad Lieutenant generates a fascination of abominations as Ferrara drives home his message about police corruption -- with Keitel's cop as the avatar of everything sick and evil in perverted law enforcement.",
            "It's a movie of wall-to-wall depravity and profound spiritual longing, at once one of the dirtiest and most deeply religious pictures I've ever seen.",
            "Alongside \"Reservoir Dogs\" Able Ferrara's 1992 tour-de-force crime drama provides the epic showcase for Harvey Keitel's impressive acting abilities. ",
            "The combination of Keitel, New York City, and the Catholic Church reminds of Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets. Yet Bad Lieutenant is much more disturbing and in your face, and successfully portrays the destruction of the soul.",
            "Keitel's performance is perhaps the needed counterpoint to Christopher Walken's ice-cold overlord in Ferrara's visionary crime opus King of New York",
            "The work of a warped wizard.",
            "Quite possibly Ferrara's finest hour, with an almost unbearably sincere performance from Keitel.",
            "Bad Lieutenant is finally a pulp parable of sin, addiction, and redemption, a movie that, like its subversive hero, revels in the pleasure -- and danger -- of going too far.",
            "Abel Ferrara's uncompromising Bad Lieutenant is a harrowing journey with a corrupt N.Y. cop sinking into the lower depths.",
            "Though hardly a film for all sensibilities, Bad Lieutenant has the courage of its own convictions, and follows them to the bitter end.",
            "There's an undeniable formal elegance in the way Ferrara, who coauthored the script with Zoe Lund, frames and holds certain shots, and Keitel certainly gives his all.",
            "The highlight of Ferrara's career--sublime.",
            "[Ferrara's] crowning achievement."

            "Revisiting his interest in oblique comedy, Jarmusch explores a primal relationship, that of a passenger and taxi driver, using the cab as a temporary shared world, from which one party may emerge shaken up or feeling differently about himself/herself",
            "Almost good, but not quite there.",
            "Beautiful color cityscapes",
            "A clever glimpse of the human condition via taxi drivers and their passengers in five different cities",

            "At the end, we have learned no great lessons and arrived at no thrilling conclusions, but we have shared the community of the night, when people are unbuttoned and vulnerable - more ready to speak about what's really on their minds.",
            "Jarmusch's movies aren't for everyone - but for the sophisticated audience he pursues there are sometimes great rewards.",
            "Night on Earth dawdles a bit, and a couple of the segments, notably the one in Helsinki, feel like half-baked epiphanies. Throughout, though, there are moments that catch you delightfully off guard."

            "With its molelike inhabitants, its sprawling war between flesh-eaters and lentil-men, its achingly sweet love story and surrealist blend of dusty antiquities and 21st-century gizmos, Delicatessen is indescribably wild.",
            "All of this is handled in a breezy, off-handed, nutsy manner, as the superb cast combines to help bring it off.",
            "Delicatessen is a fearsomely intense movie that mixes moods with formidable assurance.",
            "With their detached, sardonic and decidedly sick slant, Jeunet and Caro have served up a burnt-to-a-crisp feast.",
            "There are no characters to care about or remember afterward -- just a lot of flashy technique involving decor, some glib allegorical flourishes, and the obligatory studied film-school weirdness.",
            "A zany little film that's a startling and clever debut for co-helmers Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro.",
            "Thriving on eccentricity, the film also utilizes an artistic entwining of music and sound effects, tinged with a spectacularly compelling atmosphere of unease.",
            "Funny, imaginative, ghoulish and rather beautiful.",
            "If we take the idea of a romantic comedy set in the ruins of a dead society and dressed up with cannibal horror seriously at all, it's hard to see how it could turn out better than this.",
            "The movie, take it from me, is a lot more fun to sit through than to describe in a single sentence.",
            "Bizarre, brilliant, but wayward in its d\u00e9nouement.",
            "Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro made a brilliant feature film debut with this bizarre and visually stunning comedy about cannibalism.",
            "A must see, Delicatessen is an absolute delight and a bizarrely madcap experience.",
            "What will filmmakers Jeunet and Caro serve for dessert in their next movie? Something equally daring, one hopes -- but more thoroughly cooked and a bit easier to swallow.",
            "Sweet, sinister and endearingly scruffy.",
            "Like a light-hearted Brazil it conjures up imagery of such impact, and such resonant subject matter that it will (...) affect audiences for generations to come.",
            "Serves up a stew that seems to be made of a little of everything from one hundred years of screen comedy, seasoned with Grand Guignol. [Blu-ray]",
            "[A] black-hearted black comedy, directed as if it were a living cartoon. ",
            "Dark comedy-fantasy about cannibalism isn't for kids.",
            "Part macabre horror, part romantic drama, part childlike fable, this ingeniously original French film defies categorization, but is successful on all of these levels, which may explain why it has become an international cult classic.",
            "If Rube Goldberg had concocted the film Eating Raoul, it might have turned out something like Delicatessen.",
            "Eventually, Delicatessen descends into raw grotesquerie and excess. But first, it serves as an ample experimental field and proving ground for a wild talent that's thankfully become more disciplined with time.",

            "Dash's project is similar to Mr. Snead's ... Chronicling the islanders' way of life - their practices, personalities and stories - before it's gone forever.",
            "Dash drew on her own family history to fashion Daughters of the Dust and throughout, there's an unshakable sense that the viewer is being called to bear witness. Heed the call.",
            "This is balletic, operatic cinema, and a celebration of cinema itself.",
            "This elegiac, dreamlike drama set on the Sea Islands off South Carolina in 1902 has an iron core of painful history",
            "The film offers a poetic political vision of a society falling between the stools of progression and regression, asking whether standing off against the travesties of the antebellum American South is the only way to attain true freedom.",
            "It is a mysterious, fabular and sometimes dreamlike film with its own theatrical poise.",
            "Dash's command of elusive expression unveils a thrilling, immersive mystique of her subjects.",
            "Beautiful, slow-paced historical drama; violence, cursing. ",
            "The film has a flowing, lyrical structure that slowly envelops you, immersing you in a lost language, culture and time, and the images of African-American women in white dresses and starched collars playing on a lonely beach earn their iconic status.",
            "Visually beautiful classic.",
            "Dash's seminal drama is that rare ensemble piece truly focused on the collective, how individuals complicate and contradict notions of community. ",
            "You must watch Daughters because you will not find a film like it anywhere. It's like some rare bird that's not only striking because of its unusual colors but because of the perfection of its form.",
            "Daughters damns precedent altogether, sidestepping the broad strokes of African-American history familiar from so many textbook historical dramas set during the era of antebellum slavery or the '60s Civil Rights Movement. ",
            "A ravishingly beautiful work, it presents the historically grounded story of a multi-generational Gullah family reuniting on an island off South Carolina's coast.",
            "The restoration and re-issue of Julie Dash's masterpiece is a valuable reminder that black female filmmakers are still woefully underrepresented in contemporary cinema.",
            "If you find yourself thirsty for more Lemonade this summer, find the time to take in a screening of Daughters of the Dust. The trip will open your eyes and your mind.",
            "It's lushly photographed and costumed, plus dreamily confusing, yet it vividly brings a past to life.",
            "Daughters of the Dust captures with precision and great beauty a point in history, the transition of African Americans from rural to urban at the turn of the last century.",
            "Dash has created a cinematic essay that immerses her audience in a world no other film has explored.",
            "Even when the pace slows to a crawl, the island's gentle mood is appealing.",
            "An absorbing, spirited film that merits considerable respect.",
            "A poetic tribute to African culture, the oral tradition and the spirit of the Gullah people.",
            "The stately pace serves the film's central theme - a discourse on the inevitability of change - which is enriched by much visual poetry.",
            "Daughters' impressionistic look at the Great Migration (who will go, who will stay, and at what cost?) combines a corporeal sense of history with poetic, often indirect and allegorical underpinnings."

            "In the absence of the usual teen-movie pyrotechnics, Zebrahead has a quiet, stagy style, more like a 1950's teleplay with a social conscience than a stormy present-day tale of racial strife.",
            "Zebrahead is not so much a movie as notes toward a movie - a good one, judging by what's on the screen.",
            "In Anthony Drazan's enjoyably offbeat Zebrahead, racial definition is the least important thing about anybody.",
            "The pulsing beats collected by music supervisor M.C. Serch...act almost as another living player in the film, imbuing it with a certitude which surely would have left Drazan's film lacking had it not been there.",
            "Zebrahead is a thoughtful film that speaks honestly and hopefully to urban teens. Drazan has earned his stripes.",
            "It is a remarkable first film, not only for what it says about friendship, love and antagonisms between young urban blacks and whites, but for how sharply it reveals a city making headlines even now with a new, true tragedy.",
            "The movie takes us to the two places where bigotry are both nurtured and perpetuated, the home (here single parent) and the racially diverse school, where the youngsters prove more mature and open-minded than their parents.",
            "A movie more earnest and well-meaning than wholly successful, Zebrahead is still worthy of praise - if only for treating its teenagers like actual people.",

            "Franklin's convincing portrait of life on both sides of the color line isn't quite like anything I've come across before, making One False Move one very assured directorial move. We need more filmmakers like him.",
            "For most of the way, One False Move is taut and sure-footed.",
            "Skillfully performed and welcomely unpredictable, this low-budget crime film, made by actor turned director Carl Franklin, starts out as a herky-jerky exploitation piece, then turns into something better.",
            "Everything about this movie -- the terse writing, the concise directing, the smart, unaffected acting -- is eminently satisfying.",
            "The overall journey is slow and in great need of editing or reworking to create keener emphasis on the motives that lead to specific choices and confrontations.",
            "Even worse than this annoying contrivance is Fantasia's portentous speech about the cry of a whippoorwill. And, yes, we actually do hear a whippoorwill cry. Perhaps it's a sign of the death of the hopes the promising film gives rise to, but then betrays.",

            "In this film ably directed by Carl Franklin, who has spent most of his adulthood as an actor, there are more than a few tense scenes.",
            "Rookie director Carl Franklin shows an obvious gift for pace and storytelling -- uncertain, halting moments are rare. Almost every scene has rich and authentic feeling.",

            "The biggest difference between One False Move and most other action films is the sting in its violence. There is so little stylization here -- so little gimmickry -- that when someone is shot or knifed, you feel it.",
            "It exerts an almost macabre fascination as we track the killers bloody trail across several states to their inevitable deaths.",
            "Emotionally complex thriller with riveting performances.",
            "The story is punctuated by violence that's as pointless as it is nasty, though, showing an unfortunate immaturity in the filmmakers.",
            "Mixing moments of genuine terror with offbeat comedy, writers Tom Epperson and Thornton have created a script that jumps along with the energy of In Cold Blood.",
            "There's plenty to be impressed by while watching this 1992 noirish thriller, cowritten by Tom Epperson and directed by Carl Franklin, but not a great deal of aftertaste.",

            "Though the level of acting is uniformly quite high, the true star of The Best Intentions is Bergman's script.",
            "August keeps a discreet distance from the harsher realities, making The Best Intentions must viewing only if you find diluted Bergman better than no Bergman at all.",
            "The performances, though, are superbly understated-particularly the two leads, as well as Norby as Anna's commanding mother.",
            "The Best Intentions is the most moving film I've seen this year.",
            "Bergman's script succinctly weaves in refs to themes explored in his own earlier films, notably the destructive force of worship when used as a crutch for human weaknesses.",
            "Throughout, Bergman sets up a series of vivid, literate confrontations involving Fr\u00f6ler, August and other articulated characters. Director August stages these tense, intimate, emotional wrestling matches with naturalistic fervor.",
            "Though Bergman only wrote (but didn't direct), the film is permeated with his unique angst and thematic concerns, and casting Pernilla August in a major role establishes strong link to Fanny and Alexander, in which she played the servant.",
            "A deeply satisfying film.",
            "Makes the point that marriage always brings spirituality down to earth with its focus on the all the effort that goes into making an intimate relationship work.",
            "The Best Intentions is full of high drama, but the low-key, matter-of-fact telling makes everything fall into order quite naturally. High drama, in this case, does not really mean big, explosive scenes.",
            "With a running time of three hours, this weighty drama tests the most patient soul.",
            "For a time, The Best Intentions captures the elements of a profoundly difficult and credible love story, one plagued by essential differences that cannot be resolved.",
            "Realized beautifully by director Bille August, Intentions is a moving, profound requiem to all human relationships.",
            "It remains a rare August pleasure, a film for grown-up audiences that challenges and enriches.",
            "For those looking to be stylishly entertained while learning more than anyone might ever want to know about the formation of the Bergman psyche, well, here it is."

            "Far and Away... is the director's attempt to step into the cinematic shoes of directors John Ford and David Lean. And, certainly, he's stepped into something with this sprawling, old-fashioned melodrama. ",
            "A little irreverence and some revisionist strokes would have lent some welcome spice to this bland meat-and-potatoes serving of U.S. history.",
            "Howard's lifelong ambition to make a film about his Irish ancestry results in a light confection, full of sweeping overhead shots and predictable pulp-fiction intrigue.",

            "It's Ron Howard doing his \"thing.\" Which, if you don't know, is sucking it for all it is worth, with having little to begin with, and trying his darndest to spread an Oscar cream to illuminate it.",
            "The story is ridiculously old-fashioned, with romantic flourishes and visual spectacle (the land-rush scenes are outstanding) in place of an interesting storyline and well-developed characters. ",
            "With its terrific cast and splendid production values, Howard's family saga looks like far and away the grandest new-old movie of 1992.",
            "This time the concept of TV-for-a-very-big-screen comes out silly.",
            "Far and Away looks like an epic, but it lacks flavor and texture. It's so predigested there's nothing left to chew on.",
            "Though blatantly no Eyes Wide Shut, this second on-screen pairing for the Super-A couple remains a class apart from the dross that was Days Of Thunder.",
            "Ron Howard comes up with his own little creation myth for America, free of such inconvenient original sins as genocide and slavery.",
            "Away isn't for cynics, providing an authentic rush of experience that makes the effort feel huge, even when it details the smallest interests of the heart. ",

            "Dafoe completely inhabits the character, appearing in virtually every scene and developing a fascinating psychological profile.",

            "Willem Dafoe's performance as LeTour is the glue that holds the film together, and it's a remarkable one.",
            "Light Sleeper remains a superior picture from one of America's more stimulating filmmakers.",
            "[A] leisurely paced but ultimately rewarding study of terminal addiction in all its many forms.",

            "It does develop powerfully the themes of Schrader's earlier work and will not disappoint his fans.",
            "Schrader certainly has his finger on the pulse of the times, and the universally strong performances do ample justice to his sensitive ear for dialogue.",
            "It's more hit than miss, and Dafoe's earnest portrayal carries the movie through its rockier, less sensical parts. Worth a look.",
            "A personal, melancholy tale of the midlife crisis of drug dealers in New York, Light Sleeper is done in a detached, ascetic, semi-successful Bressonian style but well acted by Willem Dafoe and Susan Sarandon.",

            "The remaining participants grapple with disillusionment, their reconcilement of the past, and their relationship to their own children.",
            "[35 Up] finds this series growing increasingly rueful with age.",
            "The latest installment in the most engrossing long-distance documentary project in the history of film.",
            "Most people will feel the start of tears at unpredictable points in this movie. They come from compassion and sympathy in the truest sense of those words -- we identify with these people living their lives as best as they can.",
            "It's a brilliant, vital human document.",
            "35 Up is a God-like glimpse of the uninterrupted trajectory of lives that is vastly disturbing, cooly scientific and intensely emotional.",
            "Part of Apted's seminal series that began with 7Up, this segment has different dynamics, emphasizing the children of the subjects and the deaths of their parents, showing stronmg evidence of the life cycle.",
            "Another engrossing entry in a groundbreaking series.",
            "35 Up is about life, real life from childhood through adulthood.",
            "Exceedingly long and repetitive.",
            "The film's realism is as ruthless as it is low-key. It's impossible not to look at the 35-year-old woman and mourn the loss of the 7-year-old girl."

            "Madden stages the action with a minimum of imagination and gets a career-worst performance out of Davis in a key role, but the material still sputters to life on the strength of the writing and Paltrow's commitment to the part.",
            "A subtle, slow-burning mystery that does justice to its themes of identity, sanity and sacrifice.",
            "An elegant adaptation to the screen, with the play's qualities largely intact and great performances from Paltrow and Hope Davis, as her sister. Jake Gyllenhaal and Anthony Hopkins complete a dream cast.",
            "We are invited to believe that Hopkins, Paltrow and Gyllenhaal all have, in their various ways, alpha-brains. They look to me like they couldn't recite the three-times-table without smoke coming out of their ears.",
            "An unlovely film about an unlovely group of people.",
            "Proof is a smart film, but it tries too hard. It wears its heart on its sleeve, and the pathos becomes a bit much because there is little to balance it out.",
            "A limp, and utterly pointless melodrama that's never as intelligent as it thinks.",
            "Timid staging faithful adaptation = no cinema",
            "offers a convincing demonstration of the theorem that good writing and sensitive performances can equal an engaging and nuanced piece of cinema.",
            "full review in Greek",
            "As a story about personal and family dysfunction, and about coming to terms with life's uncertainties, Proof isn't bad.",
            "Proof is something of a puzzle, an all-star drama that has the feel of a Sunday afternoon film. Think curiosity, not must see.",
            "Intense and compelling, Proof is an absorbing film that shows the intricacies of the human mind are as complex as a mathematical equation.",
            "Smart, well-acted, and wonderfully directed.",
            "Sure, the play won the Pulitzer Prize, but that doesn't mean it makes a great film, in my opinion. Maybe it just works better on the stage.",
            "Paltrow stars as a woman who may or may not be around the twist. Having named her real-life child after a piece of fruit, that's what I call inspired casting.",
            "...the story reveals a lot less substance than there appears to be.",
            "Sadly, the impact of the clever parallelogram of emotional and philosophical concerns in Auburn and Rebecca Miller's screenplay is deadened by the director's overly literal -- mechanical -- cinematic interpretation.",
            "A masterpiece before it reached the screen and maybe the highest praise that can be offered in celebration of this film version is that it remains one.",
            "For patient viewers, it does offer a carefully considered and ultimately inspiring examination of how the need for order and logic is less important than a willingness to embrace chaos.",
            "It's a quiet kind of triumph. I know no one saw it but I hope more people will."

            "If, as Jimmy famously tells us, there's no crying in baseball, there's plenty of it in baseball nostalgia.",
            "The film is an easygoing, fun time.",
            "A League of Their Own is a beloved comedy which not only celebrates women in baseball but continues to serve as an inspiration to women today.",
            "It is gentle, weepy and mostly inoffensive, with an ending which celebrates old people.",
            "If you isolate the performances and compare them to baseball cards, there isn't a dud destined to be traded or clipped to the spokes of a bicycle wheel.",
            "25 years later, director Penny Marshall's A League Of Their Own remains that rare thing: a sports movie with female characters to look up to.",
            "A League of Their Own is about looking back on a special time in your life. That doesn't have to be sports. ",
            "If director Penny Marshall were a baseball player, she'd probably be a scrappy catcher who plays steadily and reliably, always has her head in the game and usually comes through in the clutch.",
            "It is not Great Cinema, but it's really freaking good entertainment, smart without being brainy and nice without being saccharine.",
            "League wants you to laugh more than anything else, and Hanks makes sure that you will.",
            "The movie drones along uninvolvingly, as if it were erecting a monument, not telling a story.",
            "Any roughness is smoothed over by the talented cast and a great deal of charm and affection for the era.",
            "Though amusing enough to avoid absolutely drowning in schmaltz, it's sad to see a film with potential lose its way in the late innings.",
            "Marshall's methods overwhelm the material, and what emerges is a movie utterly without personality. A unique chapter in American history becomes a movie as ordinary as they come.",
            "What does it say about today's Hollywood when the most interesting character in a movie about a women's baseball team turns out to be a man?",
            "It's a cinematic home run, certain to please filmgoers who don't know a catcher's mitt from an oven mitt.",
            "Few of the other performers make an impression. A director who can lose Madonna in a crowd can't be said to appreciate charisma.",
            "This movie aims for the tear ducts and the funny bone as ruthlessly as the big action-fantasy hits go after the viscera.",
            "Part history, part comedy, and part soap opera, A League of Their Own casts a pretty wide net. For the most part, it's a net that's good fun to get caught in."

            "A fresh and exuberant romantic comedy that is as smart about playground basketball as Bull Durham was about minor league baseball.",

            "White Man Can't Jump is most effective at the beginning -- when it's bouncing along with the exuberance that Shelton brought to such other sports-minded movies as Bull Durham and The Best of Times.",
            "Slam-dunkingly satisfying sports comedy about two basketball hustlers (Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes) teaming up for an alley-oop of a payday, despite crying foul about each other's off-court lifestyle.",
            "Shelton is clever, and he obviously loves sports and beautiful women and even Los Angeles. Yet when it comes to telling a story, he can't seem to hit this time around.",
            "[Shelton] contributes a uniquely eccentric point of view that is simultaneously obsessed with and ambivalent about sports, athletes and competition.",

            "Five years before adapting and directing the modern masterpiece L.A. Confidential, Curtis Hanson helmed this sizable box office hit that, like 1987's Fatal Attraction, used home invasion as a crafty commercial hook.",
            "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle keeps you watching, yet this oddly somber thriller is really just a transparent chain of contrivances; it's all stunts, all concept.",

            "De Mornay seems to have found her true vocation playing the nanny from hell, but while the ensuing thrills may well be enjoyed by many, anyone with offspring of their own would be wise to stay away.",

            "Culkin is breezily winning once again as the self-reliant kid alone, while Pesci and Stern deserve combat metals (especially Stern) to the bricks and slings they endure.",
            "It's much more violent than the first film's comparable set of dirty tricks. And Kevin, removed from his embattled home, seems much more cavalier, possibly even meaner than his bullying older brother, Buzz (Devin Ratray).",
            "It is going to make a ton of money, but you never feel that's the only reason it was made. It respects itself and it respects us, and there's no reason to begrudge its success.",
            "The pleasures here are entirely cruel, with an unhealthy concentration on the suffering of the victims, on the thudding impact of various objects against their heads, on their howls of agony.",
            "The result, with some exceptions, plays like an over-elaborate parody of the first film, reminding us why we enjoyed it without being able to duplicate its appeal.",
            "The filmmakers stick like glue to the formula of the original: a little boy from a well-to-do family left on his own is threatened by low-life working-class crooks whom he repeatedly foils and tortures, and upscale property values prevail.",
            "This sequel has lots of color and Christmas warmth to recommend it. Its portrait of urban American is ridiculously romanticized, though, and the climatic fight with two silly-sinister bad guys is as nasty as it is cartoonish.",
            "Though equal to its original in quantity of sadistic slapstick, this anticipated sequel is dull and strikingly uninspired.",
            "Home Alone 2: Alone in New York is a rollicking return to the pesky juvenile high jinks, broad slapstick antics and tender sentimentality that made the first film a phenomenon -- and it does it all even better.",
            "Despite this material's definite loss of innocence and surprise, it offers some engaging moments.",
            "Culkin, an angel-faced Terminator more potent than any assault rifle-armed Schwarzenegger, swells with empowerment and lashes out, symbolically, at the indifferent parents, the ignorant teachers, the irritable authority figures, the brutal older sibling.",
            "A well-crafted film with brilliant scenes aimed at an audience that knows exactly what it's going to see. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "As slapstick escapism goes, this is well-engineered stuff, though it could have been so much better (and more believable) with a bit more heart.",
            "Taking no chances, the makers of the sequel have manufactured a remarkably close facsimile of the original movie -- even duplicating some of the jokes. But Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is an improved, more luxurious model.",
            "This is, inevitably perhaps, not as funny as the original -- the law of diminishing returns applying here as with most sequels -- although even the most demanding of viewers should find something to their liking.",
            "With any luck at all, the McCallisters will just stay home next Christmas.",
            "The picture, after all, is about Macaulay Culkin, who plays the wise, sober, inquiring, luxury-loving Kevin with the same unmannered appeal he brought to the original, and his fiendish foes, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern.",
            "This time, everybody's favorite resourceful mite is adrift in Manhattan with the same two duncey thugs on his case with the resultant cartoon mayhem of even richer and more highly evolved subteen sadism.",
            "Home Alone 2 takes up a story done before with a great cast - and Macaulay Culkin at its core - and refreshes it for another holiday classic.",
            "Whatever merits we attach to the first film in this series, they are all but abandoned somewhere in the mess of a follow-up.",
            "Just when it appears this can't get any worse, along comes white supremacist Donald Trump in a pointless cameo.",
            "As a sequel, the movie manages to be funny, if predictable, and occasionally borders on heart-warming.",
            "Does it really matter that Home Alone 2: Lost In New York is, in essence, the same movie as its megasmash predecessor?",
            "Let's face it: Culkin's self-reliant suburban warrior has entered a whole generation's pop mythology. He's their Knight in Shining Parka, safely beyond criticism."

            "This may only be a movie, but the potential for realism - for these scenarios of unrelenting torment to be exploited in real life - is absolutely staggering.",
            "Unlawful Entry has all the hallmarks of a down and dirty thriller. Implausibly gullible, Stowe's character is just a slow-witted object of desire. ",

            "Verhoeven does not explore the dark side, but merely exploits it, and that makes all the difference in the world.",
            "[The film has] a smug faith in the ability of its own speed, smartness and luxe to wow the yokels.",
            "Slick, clever and entertainingly overheated while you're watching it, Basic Instinct starts to evaporate the second you leave the theater.",
            "The harsh, politically incorrect truth about Basic Instinct is that it's a tantalizing, suspensefully correct thriller.",
            "Basic Instinct is a reminder of the difference between exhilaration and exhaustion, between tension and hysteria, between eroticism and exhibitionism. The line may be fine, but it is real enough to separate the great thrillers from the also-rans.",
            "The classic erotic neo-noir thriller...Sure, this one has questionable morals, but at least the woman has all the power.",
            "Time, sadly, hasn't been so kind to Douglas. A decade and a half later, the glimpse of his saggy naked bottom after one of the duo's sex scenes remains shocking.",

            "...a slick, stylish, and generally unsatisfying thriller from a distressingly erratic filmmaker.",
            "Verhoeven tries mightily to come across as a twisted Hitchcock, but, like his leads, he's too sick and confused to succeed.",
            "Here is a film so utterly devoid of art and intellect that nothing remains other than a husk of ridiculous ploys.",
            "Joe Eszterhas shamelessly reworks ideas and themes he had earlier exploited in films such as Jagged Edge and Music Box, but the sheer overheated nature of Verhoeven's direction makes this extremely watchable.",
            "Flashy, raunchy and schlocky, Basic Instinct is classic nineties noir for which Verhoeven's overblown direction and Stone's exposure secured a place in movie history.",
            "The result may be flimsy, but it goes out and grabs you from the start.",
            "Trailer trash Hitchcock spliced with overboiled film noir.",
            "[Verhoeven] has always had a skill for storytelling, however questionable and tasteless the materials; but here he is hopelessly defeated by Ezsterhas' talky, slow-moving, and derivative script.",
            "Call me a prude, but it's not sexy watching an erotic thriller in which every time a couple does it, one of them gets it with an ice pick. I don't care how many firmly toned tummies and tushes are bared.",
            "If Basic Instinct achieves nothing else, it will replace Caligula as Bob Guccione's favorite movie.",
            "[Stone] is the very best thing about this often disappointing, frantically sexy and, ultimately, unpalatable thriller.",
            "There's nothing new about this ploy, or about much else in Basic Instinct, but it's disheartening to see that Hollywood is still afflicted by its age-old anxiety toward strong, confident women.",
            "A vicious, grindingly manipulative urban mystery that uses a thick atmosphere of S&M kinkiness to distract the audience from the story's thinness and inanity.",
            "Through all this, there remains that calm center of nasty, brilliant social insight.",
            "Sharon Stone, in her first major-league role, comes on like a postfeminist Grace Kelly. She turns her haughty, slightly blank, cheerleader sexiness into something vampish and ominous -- an all-American beauty mask."

            "Redford directs with a fluid grace... to capture the idyllic, light-drenched aura of Maclean's early childhood memories. Even the seemingly unexciting fly-fishing sequences take on a magical air worthy of Spielberg.",

            "Moving, powerful movie of two brothers.",
            "Redford does an honorable job emulating the author's unsentimental, laconically witty style. A River Runs Through It is made with reverence and taste, but it only fitfully comes fully alive as a film.",
            "A skilled, careful adaptation of a much-admired story.",
            "This may work for you if you settle at the outset for a nostalgic, all-American mood piece.",
            "The film is blighted by an inability to break free from its source.",
            "Redford's heartfelt yet unfulfilled film feels more watered-down than haunting.",
            "Sherritt has been in a lot of movies, but the role of Rev. Maclean seems like one he was born to play. He owns it, the way that Pitt and Sheffer own theirs, and as a result it takes no time at all to believe this group as a family and become involved.",
            "There is too much taste, discretion and detachment in Redford's rendition of MacLean's sprawling family saga, but the scenery and Brad Pitt are nice to look at due to Philippe Rousselot's gorgeous Oscar-winning cinematography.",
            "Although heart-throb Pitt steals the film to some extent, veteran actor Skerritt scores highly with his outstanding and heartfelt portrait of the watchful father.",
            "Even set against the Sierra Club beauty of Redford's Montana, it's hard to get excited by fisherman casting their lines into the water.",
            "A great movie to watch with the family at Christmas.",
            "Leave your preconceptions about fishing at the door: you'll be caught hook, line and sinker.",
            "A specialist in bringing books to life as movies, Redford has a knack for finding what matters in the text and making sure it ends up on screen.",

            "Nice to look at but rather dull",

            "works superbly in its isolated setpieces, even as the film as a whole doesn't quite hang together",

            "The action and the campiness barrel along in entertaining counterpoint. You can laugh when you're not absorbed with truck chases.",
            "Fortunately, the characters all behave seriously, frequently stifling any hint of empathy - but their dialogue and actions scream of silliness.",
            "All brawn, no brains, but grows on you if you can prefer your action in one big, dumb hulking slab of alpha-male aggression.",
            "Cringe-inducing dialogue? Tick. Lots of shit being blown up? Double tick. Flexing of muscles as the stars of the day indulge in a display of cinematic cock-fighting? Triple tick.",
            "What Emmerich does do is present some very good action sequences which is probably why he was offered the opportunity to direct Independence Day.",
            "All the potential of the script's premise is diluted in a footage that is summarized in sequence after sequence of persecutions and uninteresting fights. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "One of my favorite Van Damme movies, and now it's his best franchise.",
            "There's a decent bit of escapism in here somewhere, but Emmerich doesn't possess the finesse to make the material rampage as it should.",
            "There are some pretty decent stunts-especially the one where the two main Uni-Sols go rappelling face-first down Hoover Dam-but they hardly make this $23-million turkey worth your eight bucks.",
            "With no real plot tying them together, the impressively staged big scenes become empty exercises in logistics, while the smaller scenes never develop any momentum.",
            "It may be little more than an expensive arcade game for overgrown kids, but it moves too fast for critical flak to stick.",
            "Roland Emmerich's best film, and Lundgren's best acting job. Admittedly that ain't saying much in either case, but a fun flick all in all.",
            "In the end, the main drawback is the brainlessness of the story and the lack of a believable emotional payoff."

            "The Muppet Christmas Carol is the definitive holiday classic, a triumph of comedy and tragedy with something to offer audiences of all ages. Simply perfect.",
            "Although the story has been Muppetised (with Fozzie Bear as Fozziwig, the owner of a rubber-chicken factory), no attempt has been made to water down the story, and the poignancy of the moral tale is as affecting as ever.",
            "The Paul Williams songs and Miles Goodman score are just lovely.",

            "Not, maybe, the most rigorous of Christmas Carol adaptations, although it is a lot more faithful than one would perhaps have expected... at any rate a great Muppet film.",
            "The fit between sentiment and satire is not always a comfortable one and the more dedicated fans of either the story or the Muppets may leave theaters dissatisfied.",

            "A mixed bag of mixed moods.",

            "A can't-miss opportunity to experience some of the finest filmmaking of the 20th century.",
            "An incredibly executed period piece, Howards End is as impassioned and refined a cinematic spectacle you're apt to see, belonging to a tradition of narrative and characterization belonging to a format now all but extinct.",
            "If this film were a cake it would be a grand one -- rich, sumptuous, oh-so-filling and with numerous tiers.",
            "Howard's End unfolds at a deliberate, measure pace, and it always feels like so much is happening that Ivory will scarcely be able to contain it all.",
            "It is an intelligent movie, a good movie, about real and not fake issues. And it moves the heart.",
            "[Howards End] is an ever-pertinent, wondrous and welcome return to the big screen.",
            "One of the best Merchant Ivory productions and one of the finest adaptations of an EM Forster novel.",
            "Choice performances from Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson, but any social criticism is weakened by the veneration of the privileged milieu.",
            "Merchant Ivory were famous for producing some of cinema's most lavish period dramas, and Howards End is perhaps the culmination of their craft.",
            "Jhabvala's Oscar-winning script deftly juggles the characters' romantic and financial travails, and Ivory's delicate direction manages to cut to the emotional core.",
            "What sets \"Howards End\" apart is the complex emotional life of its characters.",
            "An elegant, if bland reworking of Forster's classic 1910 novel.",
            "Thompson, radiating intelligence, shines as a woman who marries in desperation and repents at leisure.",
            "Elegant and powerful, accommodating collisions of class and temperament with the grace of a perfect Edwardian hostess, Howards End is the work to which all Merchant Ivory's other films have pointed and aspired.",
            "Ivory, working from a script by his longtime collaborator Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, has great relish in noting the smug tics in the Wilcoxes and the insipid delusions in the Schlegels. It's quietly savage.",
            "Testament to the richness of the story is that even these supporting characters have more depth than the average leading characters in an American film.",
            "Howards End provides more than enough in the way of production values-impeccable set decoration, elaborate costumes, beautiful locations and exquisite cinematography-to keep its primary audience entertained.",
            "Director Ivory has assembled a wonderful cast, and he gets them to work together as a repertory company of genius.",
            "This is the apotheosis of Classics Illustrated filmmaking, aiming at nothing more than tasteful reduction, and the fact that it's done so well here doesn't mean that it's necessarily worth doing."

            "This Candyman can elicit some bona fide shivers while the picture that bears his name is high-caliber horror in its purest, most primal form.",
            "To pull it off would take the utmost artistry and imagination, but writer-director Bernard Rose expends his energy mainly on the easier task of churning up violence and gore for its own sake.",
            "Candyman offers a plot riddled with narrative ambiguities that are never fully resolved, all as a spur to the hooked viewer to spread their own take on the Candyman myth, and so to keep it alive.",
            "Candyman is an uppper-register horror item that delivers the requisite shocks and gore but doesn't cheat or cop out.",
            "Like so many post-Val Lewton horror films, this 1992 feature starts out promisingly while the plot is mainly a matter of suggestion, but gradually turns gross and obvious as the meanings become literal and unambiguous.",
            "...the Tony Todd-starring classic from 1992 was something else.",
            "If the movie has a White lens, it at least makes room for a Black side-eye.",
            "The premise is highly original, the atmosphere terrifying, and the acting superb, especially considering the subgenre and its popularity for poor performances.",
            "Candyman is creepy without relying heavily on the elements that have always turned me away from horror... building a sense of foreboding atmosphere with the help of an incredibly chilling score by Phillip Glass.",
            "The drama in its story is put before its horror ingredients, making it one of the best films around. It's a psychological horror film with captivating social commentary.",
            "The movie soon enough abandons this interesting and original direction, detouring back onto familiar horror movie ground.",
            "While Candyman has a standard ration of supernatural powers, the movie's effects are tame. Nor does Rose exhibit any sense of humor.",
            "This is primal mythic territory. And the movie has more than its share of junky frights. It's loaded with things that go bump in the night.",
            "Madsen is absolutely terrific, giving a thoughtful and well-shaded performance as the emotionally abandoned heroine, and Rose's bold direction milks every terrifying moment of this compelling and atmospheric movie.",
            "[Helen's] loneliness would almost be pitiful if the film didn't unconsciously juxtapose it against the needs of Candyman himself. And that's exactly the point.",
            "Lots of gory moments in '90s \"urban legend\" slasher film. ",
            "Candyman has an interesting premise. It just works under its atypical treatment of cliches. But a good movie? I don't think so. [Full review in Spanish].",
            "Bernard Rose's Candyman offers a moody \"elegance\", if you will, that's sorely lacking in other horror films of the era.",
            "An urban horror allegory about the white guilt people feel standing on the outside looking in, encountering worse horrors after invading places where they just don't belong.",
            "Give Candyman hosannas for offering an intriguing premise, but then give it hell for not following through on its initial promise.",
            "Candyman stands up to the test of time and it feels even more prescient today. It had the guts the explore race relations within the context of horror without resorting to stereotypes or moralizing while still remaining scary and engaging.",
            "Tony Todd gives a memorable performance in the title role, projecting both intelligence and malice.",
            "This is a flick that's as weird, dark, gory and trashy as it is metaphorical and probing."

            "There are flashes of commercially oriented action and humor, but the overall feeling is one of a languid depression sprung straight from the heart of its author.",
            "[Burton's] dark, melancholy vision is undeniably something to see, but it is a claustrophobic conception, not an expansive one, oppressive rather than exhilarating, and it strangles almost all the enjoyment out of this movie without half trying.",
            "As Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands reminded us, Burton always has been more absorbed by what his audience sees than by what his movies say.",
            "It's the kind of film which has great stills but never quite comes alive when it actually moves -- likely to win at the box-office quicker than it does in the mind.",
            "Both Catwoman and the Penguin are unique, formidable, brilliantly costumed, and perfectly ghoulish.",
            "Tim Burton's Batman Returns is a masterpiece, and the tour de force performances from the trio of Michael Keaton, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Danny DeVito are nothing short of iconic. ",
            "[Batman Returns] is a blood-red wine that has only gotten better with age.",
            "...my biggest criticism of Batman Returns: its overstuffed narrative. Whether you see Catwoman as a villain or an antiheroine, there's a lot of moving parts in this movie and sometimes it seems like no one gets quite the attention that they deserve",
            "None have captured the feeling of Bruce Wayne's duality more, in my opinion, than Tim Burton's BATMAN RETURNS.",
            "Batman Returns doesn't quite outdo its predecessor even though the film has perfect casting with Danny DeVito as the Penguin.",
            "The film is unbelievably kitsch, and to those who associate Batman's camp period as starting with Schumacher, you really need to look at this film again.",
            "The Penguin running for office plotline is a snoozefest.",
            "A perfect Christmas movie for people who hate the holidays, and exactly the kind of film that modern studio executives are paid a small fortune to make sure you will never see the likes of again.",
            "There's unquestionable artistry in the mad world [Tim] Burton brought to life and the confidence with which he dropped it right smack into the middle of what should have been mainstream family entertainment.",
            "Routine car chases and explosions do not make a mildly dull film exciting.",
            "...embraces the weirdness of the saga without a hint of hesitation.",
            "Director Tim Burton, apparently given a free hand to create a follow-up to the hugely successful 1989 Batman, marshals all his forces to create an elaborately melancholy ode to alienation.",
            "Among the 1990s' most fruitful marriages of high-brow auteurist style and pulp source material. A Burtonesque layer cake: at bottom, his take on German Expressionism; then the Gotham grotesquerie; topping it all off is a fissuring, fracturing fairytale.",
            "Batman Returns, though, is full of grim, Dostoyevskian undertones, not to mention a multitude of bloody, violent scenes.",
            "Even though fans of the 1960s TV show may reject its brooding atmosphere, this is still impressive stuff.",
            "If Christopher Nolan never decided to direct a Batman movie, 'Batman Returns' would easily reign as the best film starring the Caped Crusader.",

            "Stylishly shot, it works well as a thriller; the result is energetic and entertaining, without the feeling of difficult truths being forgotten.",
            "Mr. Dickerson, whose cinematography has been the reason Spike Lee's films look so good, has a terrific eye and some juice of his own. ",
            "A Hitchcockian moment in an elevator is perhaps the film's signature set piece.",
            "Juice captures the traumatic and anxious roots of American gangsterism better than just about any other entry in the evergreen genre.",

            "It is genuinely slickly made and often deliberately amusing.",

            "Commanding performances mesh with solid storytelling",
            "The movie generates a real tension in its closing passages, as it shows its characters trapped in a plot that seems to be unfolding according to its own merciless logic.",
            "Dickerson's story of street kids at risk breaks no new ground. It is better than most, but not by much. Sure looks good, though.",
            "Despite the script's reliance on familiar cliches, the film never feels like an exploitation thriller, as we genuinely feel for these kids and the life they've fallen into.",
            "I'm sure Dickerson has strong feelings about inner-city problems, but if he does he can't convey them.",
            "Coming out from behind Spike Lee's camera, Ernest Dickerson has instantly arrived at the forefront of the new wave of black directors. His film aims for the gut, and hits it."

            "As they move through the martial-arts sequences, the performers leave the impression that the laws of gravity are subject to amendment. The rules of love and war -- all's fair -- are, Hero makes clear, immutable.",
            "The result is not so much a historical epic as a kind of highly determined ballet: dreamy with bloodless violence, relying less on shades of character than on magnificence of gesture.",
            "The austerity of Hero makes you realize how cluttered other action movies are.",
            "The result is both thrilling and thoughtful, offering imaginative action sequences as it considers questions of loyalty and the individual's role in history.",
            "As a technical achievement, Hero finds Zhang at the height of his powers, effortlessly expanding into complex genre filmmaking without losing his command. But in light of his earlier work, the film continues a sharp decline in urgency.",
            "One of the best Chinese movies of all time. And one of the best wuxia films of all time. Simply gorgeous. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "It is entirely possible that this is the single most beautiful film of the 2000s.",
            "An acceptable adventure that features some breathtaking action sequences and exquisite cinematography. ",
            "If it were merely lovely and silly, that would be fine, but Hero wants to be more than merely kung fu fun. It has a message.",
            "What makes Hero special is that it has so much more going for it than just the superb fight sequences. There are a satisfyingly complex plot, passionate romance, cool special effects and strong performances.",
            "Sumptuous and breath-catching, Hero blends the elegance of fine visual art with the more familiar cinematic jollies of attractive people engaged in crunching punch-ups.",
            "Zhang Yimou's Hero is a true martial arts epic -- a spectacle of movement, color and sound that will leave you awe-struck.",
            "Intoxicatingly beautiful, structurally enigmatic and decidedly brief.",
            "Gorgeous martial arts movie for older kids.",
            "Zhang weaves a complex and interesting story but the ultimate strength of Hero is its poetic beauty.",
            "When we are not left agog by the pristine production design and costuming, we marvel at the various staged conflicts, each one bringing a new level of proficiency and polish to an already overripe genre.",
            "A visually stunning martial arts epic in the wuxia tradition.",
            "Without the clarity of story, we begin to lose connection with the martial action, and it starts to seem repetitive.",
            "This intriguing, intoxicating martial-arts epic about the unification of China during the third century B.C. is a visual masterpiece.",
            "... one of the best films of its kind and one of the most beautiful films ever made.",
            "In what may be the movie's most spectacular set piece ... Zhang pits the sword against the pen and fends off war with knowledge and non-violence.",

            "Designed to get the audience rooting for this upper-class underdog, the movie accomplishes its task with military efficiency. But since the deck is stacked and the cards well worn, it hardly seems a victory to cherish.",
            "By pitting Cruise against Nicholson in the film`s final courtroom confrontation, Sorkin and Reiner are pitting two notions of masculinity and two notions of stardom against each other.",
            "A brisk and familiar courtroom drama of the old school, as pleasant to watch as it is predictable, Men more than anything else is a tribute to pure star power.",
            "The whole film, with its steady, important-picture pacing, its foursquare visual style, and its pseudo-profundity, is a piece of glorified banality.",
            "The literally in-your-face camera work can easily expose an actor's weaknesses, but, with the lens framed on Nicholson's bulldog visage, he lets loose with volcanic fury. His demagoguery and gung-ho self-righteousness are something to behold.",
            "The driving force of the story is watching Cruise`s character develop some backbone and staying power.",
            "Suspenseful, powerful, poignant, unforgettable, and sharply directed.",
            "A bit stilted and an unlikely alignment of parts, \"A Few Good Men\" maintains a taut, compelling hold from start to finish. ",
            "A star packed cast is actually pretty effective in this court drama presenting an awesome villain. Fantastic script. [Full review in Spanish].",
            "As speechy and preachy a courtroom drama as you'll ever find, detailing the secret manoeuvring that shadows a naval court-martial.",
            "There are more than a few excellent men in the cast, and a fine woman, too. But Rob Reiner's A Few Good Men roars with excitement only when Jack Nicholson seizes the drama between his sneering, snarling teeth.",
            "...a solid legal thriller that benefits substantially from a raft of better-than-average elements. ",
            "As you may have suspected, Jack Nicholson steals the show. His Col. Nathan Jessep isn't in a lot of scenes, but when he's there, you can't take your eyes off him.",
            "It's a very watchable picture, with plenty of drama and some good laughs. But you can't forget for a moment that Reiner is taking your emotions on a carefully guided tour.",
            "The film's entire cast and crew prove up to the task, and there's something both comfortably old-fashioned and blazingly contemporary about Aaron Sorkin's screenplay.",
            "The ultimate rebel Jack Nicholson has a ball playing the ultimate establishment figure in this star-laden, rather old-fashioned courtroom drama.",
            "As a courtroom drama, it manages to overcome its shortcomings -- some fairly ridiculous dialogue, implausible situations and predictable plot points -- with the pure screen power of its stars.",
            "Though a courtroom drama on the surface, the movie is really about the changing face of power in the military, and in all walks of life.",
            "I'm usually a sucker for courtroom dramas, but Rob Reiner's highly mechanical 1992 feature... kept putting me to sleep.",
            "More than competent are Moore, spared from what would have been a phony romantic involvement with Cruise, Kevin Bacon as a prosecutor and Kiefer Sutherland as a by-the-book Marine.",
            "A somber, studiedly intense drama that is absorbing despite its total predictability.",
            "The best feature of Rob Reiner's court martial drama isn't Jack Nicholson's \"You can't handle the truth\" speech. It's seeing a classy cast and a slick script hammer home a smart liberal message.",
            "Directed by Rob Reiner, from Aaron Sorkin's adaptation of his hit Broadway play, A Few Good Men is a thrillingly effective crowd pleaser.",
            "An extraordinarily well-made movie, which wastes no words or images in telling a conventional but compelling story."

            "The director, Christopher Cain, brings not a hint of irony to any of this -- not even to the Vegas finale in which Dusty is supposed to rescue himself from glitz.",
            "Pure Country is an Elvis movie with a thick country twang.",
            "Pure twaddle.",
            "Singers often make good actors, but Strait's debut performance doesn't measure up to his heartfelt, down-home warbling. It doesn't matter much: Pure Country is pure corn.",
            "Pure Country doesn't have much real drama in it because it`s only a flip of the coin as to how the story is going to turn out. But Strait and newcomer Glasser make solid impressions.",
            "Though this slick-looking paean to down-home values often undercuts its own message, Pure Country is an effective vehicle for amiable country star George Strait.",
            "As directed by Christopher Cain, Strait's first feature will probably not go down as a classic contemporary western nor a great modern musical. But it lopes along pleasantly, and Strait effortlessly makes the crossover into acting.",
            "If it were any cornier or mushier, it would be chowder, but this vehicle for country singer Strait generates a charming sweetness, the music is lively, and both Strait and Glasser are ingratiating new faces.",
            "This is an enjoyable movie for fans of country music, for whom the rich soundtrack should be a delight. And if they happen to have a crush on George Strait, so much the better.",
            "Strait gives an uncertain performance, full of blatantly rehearsed reactions and stoic delivery. It looks like he's reluctant to participate, and you can hardly blame him.",
            "You always know that you're being manipulated by Pure Country, and you're usually pretty sure what's going to happen next. Still, chances are fairly good you'll leave the theater smiling when it's over, humming one of the sentimental songs.",
            "If Strait weren't so appealing, the movie would be easier to dismiss. Let's hope it does well enough to give him a second shot and that maybe he can find something a little bit less Vegas and a little bit more East Texas.",
            "Your opinion of this tale of a troubled country superstar will depend totally on your reaction to George Strait. There's no denying he's handy with a tune, but dialogue proves more difficult for him.",
            "Country superstar George Strait is so laid-back he barely registers onscreen in Pure Country, an unabashedly corny by-the-numbers drama.",
            "The romantic subplot between Strait and Glasser's respective characters goes a long way towards perpetuating the movie's affable atmosphere...",
            "Too much of it depends on the magnetism of Mr. Strait, who peers into the camera sheepishly and never seems the superstar he is supposed to be.",
            "George Strait plays it right to his name in Pure Country, a pleasant, low-key country-and-western film.",
            "Country-western singing star George Strait makes his film debut with Pure Country, a show-biz love story that's pure corn pone. Not that his fans will mind in the least.",
            "This is the very definition of the kind of movie where fans of the star will enjoy it more than dispassionate observers.",
            "Country music superstar George Strait makes his acting debut in an extended music video held together by a formulaic plot that harkens back to the Golden Age of Hollywood."

            "Lumet made the regrettable choice of sacrificing credible character development and a worthy script for the sake of maintaining Hasidic authenticity and attenuated scenes of religious observances.",
            "There's apparently something about Hasidic Jews that makes normally talented and reasonable filmmakers turn otherwise straightforward thrillers into harebrained hootfests.",

            "Like Griffith's character, the film falls in love with the traditionalist Hassids, choking on scene after scene of ethnic dancing and stuck-on beards, every interior bathed in a golden Hovis advert glow.",

            "The film presents itself as worthy, but it's ultimately boring. [Full Review in Spanish] ",

            "Russell Crowe as Maximus has the charismatic glower of a true star.",
            "A movie initially intended as summer popcorn, but which somehow scored a Best Picture Oscar: the only one of Scott's lengthy and impressive canon to have done so.",
            "It took \"Alien\" director Ridley Scott to reinvigorate, however briefly, the sword and sandal genre at the turn of the 21st century. ",
            "Gladiator has the distinction of being both timely and nostalgic.",
            "This may be fundamentally Saturday night entertainment, but Scott attempts rather more than that on occasion, and at least succeeds in creating a memorable sense of a dark and often frightening period of time.",

            "The greatest mystery in White Sands is the casting. Mimi Rogers has an embarrassingly marginal role as Ray's wife.",
            "A baffling thriller, filled with double-crosses, but is absorbing and mostly a fun watch.",
            "Not a bad little noir, but not exactly memorable, either.",
            "An intriguing mystery with good performances and a crisp style."
