            "That story counts for less than gimmicks, and characters less than both, might be judged from the lack of resonance in the one narrative revelation, concerning Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker.",
            "The Empire Strikes Back Displays the same soaring imagination that made Star Wars a filmmaking classic; most other space movies seem clunky and earthbound in comparison.",
            "This is a respectable sequel to Star Wars but not as good.",
            "The Empire Strikes Back is no bland derivative. It has all the freshness and exuberance of an original. A marvellous space fantasy full of dazzling spectacle, exciting adventure, strange creatures and the mythic clash between good and evil.",
            "The Empire Strikes Back is the ultimate in fantasies, a visual wonder and a movie that should be recommended highly if only because it makes you feel good.",
            "Despite a couple of drawbacks, the Empire Strikes Back is an immense amount of fun -- big and splashy and breathtaking in its display of cinematic genius by a huge group of marvelously talented people.",
            "Promotions in the Galactic Empire are instigated by execution; torture is more vivid; villains are more numerous; loss is more agonizing; and happy endings are more elusive.",
            "Kirshner's direction gives the film an extra flare that Star Wars did not have. He got to make things bigger, both physically and in terms of the ideas at play. ",
            "If A New Hope is the body of Star Wars, Empire can lay pretty good claim to being its soul.",
            "Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is arguably one of the three greatest Star Wars films heading into The Rise of Skywalker.",
            "An indubitable classic, not only of its genre but of the seventh art in general. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "Seeing the arc of Luke's daddy issues culminate at the end of The Empire Strikes Back blew everyone's mind. ",
            "The special effects are great and the writing is poignant, funny, emotional, everything you could want in a movie.",
            "Among the best sci-fi ... anything... ever. It has a darker tone, but still has plenty of fun, I'd have no problem putting it on and watching it all over again.",
            "A tight story, incredible twists, great characters and crunching action scenes, all tied up with a terrific ending - if you don't believe so, that is why you fail.",
            "Topping the most successful act in show business history is an impossibility, of course. But that's the challenge facing everyone who worked on \"The Empire Strikes Back.\" They have succeeded to an altogether remarkable extent. ",
            "The best 'Star Wars' film, an exciting and thrilling adventure, but also a sober and complex picture. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Has any movie sequel ever so thoroughly surpassed impossible expectations as The Empire Strikes Back?",
            "...an erratically-paced yet consistently entertaining installment in a not-quite-great sci-fi series.",
            "To answer the big question first: Yes, The Empire Strikes Back is just as enjoyable as Star Wars. In fact, this is one sequel that defies tradition by being better than the original on several counts -- most of them technical, but a few dramatic.",
            "Another richly imaginative, engrossing and spectacular motion picture from the redoubtable George Lucas.",
            "The Empire may not top Star Wars, but it certainly makes one look forward to whatever new surprises George Lucas and his band of cinematic wizards can conjure up for us.",
            "It is technically even more proficient [than Star Wars], has virtually the same ingredients and bursts forth into a world that still seems ripe for its special blend of nostalgically simple story-telling and complicated technology.",
            "It is hard to place one's affections anywhere in a world which is ruled by buttons and dials, computers and bleeps, and people whose conversation is... technical, inaudible or dull."

            "The movie stands as a luminous portrait of the tragic tone and style of a middle-class life that aspires to nothing beyond materialistic comfort. It seems like a small tragedy. But it's not.",
            "Despite the sponginess of the content, Hutton's extraordinary film acting debut ought to assure his famous novice director a long, successful career behind the camera.",
            "With the skill of a practiced surgeon, Redford gradually peels away the protective layers of his characters, exposing their flaws, their darkest fears and ultimately, their innermost feelings.",
            "Story of emotional honesty is best for older kids.",
            "With no action, few characters, and little suspense, the film relies heavily on its acting - and what an impressive aspect it is.",
            "Despite technical flaws and awkward story-telling, Ordinary People has tremendous emotional power.",
            "Robert Redford brings stirring emotion and impressive skill to this story of an affluent family crumbling under the facade of normalcy.",
            "Adapted brilliantly and faithfully from the surprise best-selling novel by Judith Guest.",
            "Ordinary People (baroque music and all) will probably move a lot of people in the same way as Kramer vs. Kramer did, concerned as it is with people we all know, or might well be.",
            "The quality of the film is not spectacular enough to obviate the fact that this is another story of the pain and torment that even money can't buy you out of.",
            "The confident and effective ensemble make up a family portrait, where tragedy has arrived to shatter the peace and tranquility of their lives in Chicago. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "...an especially tony Afterschool Special.",
            "For its apparent lack of action, Ordinary People is superbly moving and dramatic, generating great excitement in the exchanges between characters.",
            "Mary Tyler Moore also excels as the cold-hearted mother -- a role very much against type.",
            "'Ordinary people' is not particularly boring, it's especially exhausting and false, as well as biased. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "It would be unfair to blame Ordinary People for the culture from which it springs; and, within its limits, this is an entertaining and skillful film.",
            "Under Redford's direction, even the smallest scenes practically leap off the screen.",
            "This is still an auspicious directorial debut that stands as one of the first films to deal intelligently with the role of therapy.",

            "It's interesting to note that Brubaker, before it devotes itself entirely to the protagonist's exploits, boasts a first act revolving around the happenings within the central penitentiary...",
            "The first half-hour is powerful stuff, but after Brubaker reveals his true identity, the movie begins to falter, with the one-dimensional nature of the characters (particularly the warden himself) eventually stripping the story of any dramatic charge.",
            "I never felt that I was wasting my time watching 'Brubaker,' only that it could have been a more dramatic and taut prison movie-which is odd, because it's directed by Stuart Rosenberg ('Cool Hand Luke').",
            "Inspired by fact, this politically conscious prison drama is well written (script was Oscar nominated), but only decently acted by Redford, who might not have been the right choice.",
            "It was hard to sit through two hours of such brutality and misery and say you enjoyed it.",
            "Redford is the main attraction, obviously, even though his princely good looks -- like the movie's 'idealistic crusader against the Establishment' earnestness -- are almost too much of a good thing.",
            "intense and a bit cliched",
            "Robert Redford, in a surprise acting tour de force, really stretches his style and mannerisms to become Henry Brubaker.",

            "A good, not great, movie that reps a solid, mid-career performance by Redford."

            "A hysterical nightmare of repressed sexuality and gender identity, it is arguably De Palma's masterpiece, but certainly a film you won't forget.",

            "This is a masterpiece. It proves that a film can have violent undertones and overtones, but still illuminate and comment upon violence in a moving, poetic and profound way.",
            "Martin Scorsese's obsession with a dubious mystique of masculinity turns \"Raging Bull\" into a ponderous work of metaphysical cinematic bull.",
            "\"Raging Bull\" ultimately has a numbing effect on the brain as if one's head had been pummeled by La Motta's so-called \"girlish\" fists.",
            "The other night, my wife and I sat down to watch the new 30th Anniversary Blu-ray edition of Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull. I could scarcely believe it's been three decades since...",
            "When has a performer as fully and uniquely sacrificed himself to the moving-picture cause as De Niro?",
            "The complete absence of redeeming qualities during a relentless downward spiral hinders it from being wholeheartedly enjoyable.",
            "Martin Scorsese's boxing opus delivers the goods and then some. Robert De Niro's work here is inspiring. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Raging Bull may very well be the film that saved Scorsese's life.",
            "Scripters Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin would have you believe LaMotta spent most of his life either throwing punches or yelling his head off at whoever was nearby. In short, La Motta's life hardly warrants screen treatment.",
            "Raging Bull is wonderfully made and features one of the all-time greatest performances, but I feel like I'm missing the point.",
            "The film pushes somewhat of a limited thesis, especially compared to Scorsese's superior existential portraits in Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, and The Last Temptation of Christ.",
            "It is worth mentioning Robert De Niro's performance. His way around the ring and his transformation after his character retires are nothing short of incredible. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Raging Bull moves with a feverish rhythm and brandishes an obsessive style.",
            "This is, I suppose, a film about a slob, a violent and stupid man whose few brains are knocked even further sideways every time he enters the ring. But, somehow, he becomes intriguing in the telling.",
            "From this disastrous and brutal history, Martin Scorsese has made a brutal, discerning and bleakly beautiful picture.",
            "It's certainly bruising to watch, thanks both to the ferocity of its fight scenes and the violent misogyny of its protagonist. This is a film that doesn't pull any punches when it comes to portraying machismo.",
            "endlessly compelling",
            "Raging Bull is a fascinating exploration of the mind of an emotionally disconnected man. It's brutal, crass and impossible to look away -- much like a real boxing match.",
            "Scorsese might never again find a subject as ideal as Jake LaMotta, the Bronx-based boxer whose public bouts and private demons Raging Bull chronicles with such bruising acuity. ",

            "Interesting, rewarding and, at times, surprisingly episodic.",
            "Robert De Niro's metamorphosis into boxing legend Jake La Motta (AKA the Bronx Bull) is one of the most impressive acting transformations on celluloid.",

            "Here Steve's 'undercover' status serves as a metaphor for his closetedness (and vice versa) - while murder is committed at the behest of an internalised paternal voice of authority that regards homosexuality as a guilt that must be bloodily expunged.",
            "The principal complaint, artistically, about Cruising is that it is not very clear at the rudimentary level of exposition of character and event. The problem... is in a script that never seems sure enough what it wants to say or prove.",
            "William Friedkin's Cruising is a work of art.",
            "What we're left with is a movie without the courage to declare itself.",
            "This detective melodrama has something to offend almost everyone.",
            "What's left is the framework for a graphic, brutal, sickening film, without the violent effects that might have made sense (however illegitimate) out of the conception.",
            "...it's a straight-up thriller, and it works in that regard and as just a peek into another world.",
            "This is a malicious movie from the grim voyeurism of the ungraphically depicted sex to the nauseating and unnecessarily explicit scenes of violence.",
            "Friedkin's unique approach to the serial killer thriller is one that is both frustrating and engrossing.",
            "It's too interesting and professional to be bad, but it's just too ugly and gross to be good. ",
            "Seen today, Cruising isn't the lurid gay-bashing pulp it was labeled at the time. But neither is it a particularly adept crime procedural. ",
            "An absolute bust as a murder-mystery, as a character study, and as an in-depth look at an alternative culture.",
            "There is so much talent in this film, from its very first moments with the unsettling strings by Jack Nitzsche.",
            " It's certainly not the grotesque failure of art and morality described in 1980... But a failure nonetheless.",
            "Appropriately framed by opening and closing shots of a garbage scow, Cruising is trash.",
            "While the savagery of the murders and the explicitness of the sexual practices on display are initially unsettling, they soon become numbing and, ultimately, yawn-inducing.",
            "Cruising is no lost classic, but the critical shoeing doesn't square with Friedkin's intelligence and steady, sparse technique.",
            "Viewers are spared nothing as Steve Burns undergoes degrading brutality after brutality; virtually nobody is portrayed sympathetically.",
            "What an odd relic of the 1980s Cruising is. Controversial enough at the time to derail director William Friedkin's career, thirty years later it's considered totally benign when a Disney star films a reconstruction of its X-rated scenes.",
            "Is it possible that Cruising is everything its detractors and defenders say it is?",
            "Friedkin makes the kind of films that a pod from Invasion of the Body Snatchers might make given the chance.",
            "Taking away the kissing, caressing and a few bloody killings, Friedkin has no story, though picture pretends to be a murder mystery combined with a study of Al Pacino's psychological degradation.",
            "still unsettling even after far more explicit fare has been produced in recent years",
            "A lot of upcoming filmmakers saw \"Cruising\" and took notes, because the movie became the prototype for every serial killer movie to follow (see \"Se7en,\" \"Basic Instinct\" etc.)."

            "This 1970 animated feature is dull, careless, and all too typical of the Disney studio's slapdash output before the unexpected renaissance of The Rescuers.",
            "Helped immeasurably by the voices of Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, Sterling Holloway, Scatman Crothers and others, plus some outstanding animation, songs, sentiment, some excellent dialog and even a touch of psychedelia.",
            "The Aristocats is one of the slightest of director Wolfgang Reitherman's contributions to the Disney animated feature canon, which is to say it's still among the studio's least suffocatingly ornate and ideologically risible films.",
            "Purr-fect.",
            "The animation is masterful and the overall design is appealing.",
            "I kind of feel the same way about the Aristocats as I felt about Fun, Fancy and Free. Both felt very lazy and derivative of better films.",
            "The carefully painted Paris setting has the watery air of Ardizzone, while light and colour are used beautifully throughout.",
            "Before the disastrous Aughts, was there a worse decade for Disney animated features than the 1970s? ",
            "A cute, feline version of \"Lady and the Tramp\" that should enthrall families . . . and, of course, cat lovers.",
            "Jazz and hijinks make this Disney cat tale meow.",
            "Insofar as the film has any real ambition driving it, that ambition seems to be that the Disney brand name must be kept alive until somebody could figure out what to do with it.",

            "has a charm behind it that shines through",

            "The Aristocats is largely an up-scale cat version of 101 Dalmatians minus the deliciously dastardly villain.",

            "If punk is a sensibility as well as an adjective, Mad Max is a punk movie. Its Australian setting enhances it, authenticating its futuristic aura.",
            "[The] film has been consigned to the grind houses, where audiences are responding as Miller wants them to. From there Mad Max will find its way to the film schools and revival houses, where its tough-gutted intelligence may be appreciated.",
            "Simple, but effective.",
            "Overnight, Mad Max went from being a U.S. cult hero to a mainstream figure, and Mel Gibson's place in the firmament was secured.",
            "Stunts themselves would be nothing without a filmmaker behind the camera and George Miller, a doctor and film buff making his first feature, shows he knows what cinema is all about.",
            "Some of the most determinedly formalist filmmaking this side of Michael Snow.",
            "If you haven't seen writer-director George Miller's Mad Max in quite some time, then it's very likely you're not even remembering it right.",
            "The scene transitions and attention to continuity aren't the most scrutinized, but the editing and framing of action sequences never betray the age of the film.",
            "There's something about Mad Max...that's allowed it to stand the test of time, not only as a work of art in and of itself, but also as a name and brand that commands cultural currency thirty years since the character's last appearance.",
            "It may not be my personal favourite genre, but what a showcase of creativity and grit.",
            "It's a tough little piece, just a little grimy, full of ambiance (love the crumbling sign over \"Hall of Justice\") and attitude and occasionally sparked by an inspired flourish.",
            "While it may not be as slick as Miller's other films featuring Gibson's iconic anti-hero, Mad Max still remains a timeless classic and one of the more remarkable films of its (or any) time. ",
            "A solid and entertaining spectacle, filled with brilliantly staged action scenes and made all the more fascinating for its oracular indication of the age of bold movie science fiction that was to follow.",
            "An action masterpiece...",
            "No imitation can compete with the grindhouse jaggedness of Miller's original pursuit",
            "Its perhaps unjustified narrative shortcuts hardly seem to be much worth complaining about in the middle of its flawless action sequences.",
            "Manages not to waste a single frame of film even as it wastes countless motorcycles, trailers, automobiles and other vehicles across the bad roads of rural Australia.",
            "Suffers from a case of terminal fatigue.",
            "[Max's] his weapon is a souped-up auto, which sets up chase scenes that make The Dukes of Hazzard seem like a hayride -- a feat director George Miller engineered with a meager $1 million budget. Dramatically, however, the film is inconsistent.",
            "Less pretentious and more gripping than the overrated sequel, The Road Warrior, but viciously violent and awfully shallow.",
            "Mad Max is a straight forward fusion of two B-movie genres popular in the 1970s: the car chase film and the vigilante revenge film.",
            "...essentially serves as the setup for the far superior Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior.",
            "While Mad Max has been hailed as a classic by some, it becomes plain to see that that reputation is not entirely deserved thanks to a bare-bones plot that doesn't even fill 90 minutes and a sluggish pace that will leave viewers struggling to stay awake.",
            "Beyond the explosive nature of the road movie, Mad Max also works as a character piece."

            "Within the limitations of the genre, this story of private Benjamin ends up being entertaining at times. It doesn't add anything new, but it brings to us a new and special performance from the brilliant actress Goldie Hawn. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "It's basically a one-joke effort, but that joke has Hawn throwing herself with great gusto into the role of a bewildered spoilt brat who comes good and her Oscar-nominated performance has huge charm.",

            "Visually and philosophically, it's Fuller's equivalent of Kurosawa's Kagemusha, although Fuller's film is more complex, more absurd and more haunted.",
            "Although these are the stock characters of war drama - the sage, grizzled Sarge, the farm boy, the street kid, the nice guy who doesn't want to kill anyone and the witness - Fuller's are particularly credible ordinary people.",
            "'The Reconstruction,' which clocks in at 2 hours, 43 minutes, with not a single extraneous frame, elevates the work from a robust genre film to a full-blown epic.",
            "Even though it has gained more than 45 minutes, it doesn't feel longer. Scenes that were choppy or half-baked are now allowed to play out as Fuller intended.",
            "The director's gift for bare-knuckles lyricism rescues scene after scene.",
            "It's an adventure film as refreshing in content and style as The Deer Hunter was horrifyingly realistic and Apocalypse Now was terrifyingly philosophical.",
            "But in the end, for a film that pretends to be anti-war, it comes across as ambiguous, which isn't anything new in the work of Samuel Fuller. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "... if you want a World War II story from a real vet's perspective, Sam Fuller is still the man and The Big Red One, drawn from his own war experiences, is the film",
            "Personal observation bleeds out of every scene, and somehow it feels like a true story in a way that most war movies can't achieve.",
            "... displays both raw power and the hint of war's brutality.",
            "meant to be the culmination of a life's work... It didn't come to pass.",
            "The cast smartly underplays things, with Marvin being as charismatic as usual playing a man of few words. And Hamill, an actor given to over-the-top outbursts, reins it in here; this may be his best big-screen performance.",
            "These places were where Fuller himself served during the war, and he imbues these stories with the same gritty detail he probably delivered telling them over a beer.",
            "Schickel's painstaking work elevates The Big Red One into the pantheon of the all-time great war films and gives it a fullness that the original only suggested.",
            "Fuller went a step further, baring not only his soul but the wartime scars inflicted upon it. For all its merits, the 1980 version of the film denied audiences that connection. The new version both restores and reaffirms it.",
            "Fuller wrote and directed The Big Red One with a reporter's respect for detail and a humanist's respect for the moments that shape lives.",
            "To see this seamless 'reconstruction' -- consisting of some 15 entirely new sequences as well as augmentations to 23 others -- is to behold a masterpiece revealed.",
            "It's sometimes so explicit, corny and odd that you can understand why a studio had second thoughts about it. But it also now has the feel of a true epic.",
            "The reconstruction is a bigger, longer and better movie than the one released in 1980, but is less than the revelation for which one might have hoped."

            "This picture is a delight in many respects, for it has been produced so pleasingly and with such efficient portrayals that only a dyed-in-the-wool cynic could fail to be affected by its sterling humor and pathos.",

            "No matter how you may think you feel about child actors, the Temple infant will get you.",
            "This is the sort of yarn that Runyon told well and often: hard-hearted wise guys melting when they have to put aside tough talk and show their true emotions. It'll have you showing your emotions, too.",
            "It would be a mistake to think of the film as a Shirley Temple vehicle, since it owes as much or more to Adolphe Menjou, the tragic Dorothy Dell and Damon Runyon's chracters.",
            "The original remains the most memorable of all of the versions because of Shirley, there was no one quite like her."

            "The musical biography by now has a pattern as fixed as a traditional 12-bar blues. It is just that some blues are better than others, and so are some musical biographies. Coal Miner's Daughter... is on of the best of its kinds.",
            "Coal Miner's Daughter is most interesting when it's conveying the bleak, dreary Kentucky landscape that formed Lynn's childhood. It's least interesting when it's portraying the agonies of show-business success.",
            "A thoughtful, endearing film charting the life of singer Loretta Lynn from the depths of poverty in rural Kentucky to her eventual rise to the title of 'queen of country music'.",
            "Highly conventional stuff, but lovingly constructed to produce unremarkable but heart-warming entertainment.",
            "Like its subject, the movie celebrates down-hominess but should win over plenty of city folk.",
            "[Sissy Spacek] brings to the character a wide-eyed ingenuousness and refreshing love of the small but wondrous things in life.",
            "Because the film never breaks out of its conventional matrix, it never really becomes interesting. Despite Sissy Spacek's. performance. it is impossible to feel much for her or for her family.",
            "Loretta Lynn's tough but heartwarming biopic.",
            "Though a classic rags to riches saga, this biopic of Loretta Lynn doesn't fall victim to cliches, and benefits immensely from the astonishingly authentic turn from Sissy Spacek, who does her own singing; even real-life singer Lynn liked the picture",
            "Superior biopic with an unforgettable performance by Sissy Spacek",
            "\"Coal Miner's Daughter\" risks understating its story to make Loretta Lynn's biography part of a larger fabric, and the gamble pays off.",
            "The movie isn't great art, but it has been made with great taste and style; it's more intelligent and observant than movie biographies of singing stars used to be.",
            "A rousing musical biopic that is a cut above its peers.",
            "This uplifting drama, based on Loretta Lynn's autobiography, shows how her marriage kept changing to accommodate her career as the First Lady of country music.",

            "At worst, the film is an empty vessel that places blind trust in affected stillness and symmetry. But Kagemusha quite often switches on a dime to more deep and meaningful textures.",
            "Kagemusha, much like the similarly overblown but handsomely mounted Lawrence of Arabia, is an epic with a cipher in its point position.",
            "The film he finally made is simple, bold, and colorful on the surface, but very thoughtful. Kurosawa seems to be saying that great human endeavors (in this case, samurai wars) depend entirely on large numbers of men sharing the same fantasies or beliefs.",
            "There is beauty in Kagemusha but it is impersonal, distant and ghostly. The old master has never been more rigorous.",
            "Beyond the exquisite visual effects and battles, what is most interesting about the story is its protagonist: a double who turns into the shadow of the warrior Kagemusha. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Excellent historical drama shows Kurosawa's broad range of gifts and skill.",
            "The film swings like a pendulum between stillness and action, an occasionally jarring mix of David Lean-like panoramas with intimate character study.",
            "A fine example of the Kurosawa style...precision of narrative in both scripting and imagistic storytelling... [Blu-ray]",
            "Though not as overall impressive as his next picture Ran, Kagemusha, Akira Kurosawa's return to the epic Samurai film deservedly received Oscar nominations for its great pictorial beauty and other production values.",
            "Here, as in all of Kurosawa's late films, this sense of hopeless fixity renders unconvincing any hope for human agency.",
            "Nakadai's performance as Kagemusha and Shingen is impressive, creating two distinct characters, one of whom eerily mimics the other",
            "Dull and plodding presentation of an interesting period of Japanese history.",
            "A powerful film.",
            "Despite its length, it never drags."
