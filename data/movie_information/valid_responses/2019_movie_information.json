            "What you will be getting when you walk into an inevitably overstuffed movie theater is something singular that reflects our age in a way that none of the MCU films that preceded it have-indeed, very few Hollywood spectacles ever have.",
            "The only complaint about Avengers: Endgame is that it raises the bar so high that there may well never be a superhero movie to match it.",
            "What's missing from \"Endgame\" is the free play of imagination, the liberation of speculation, the meandering paths and loose ends that start in logic and lead to wonder.",
            "The final battle is giddily cathartic, but the catharsis arises from prioritising character development over plot and spectacle. This, I imagine, will be the Avengers' legacy.",
            "The MCU will go on and on, but this chapter - and the American pragmatism vs. American ideals bromance that drove it - have well and truly come to their \"Excelsior! Nuff said!\" moment. ",
            " \"Avengers: Endgame\" was a wonderful surprise, filling almost every minute (all 181 of them) with excitement, drama, humor, and visually interesting and entertaining intrigue.",
            "What The Russo Brothers did here is take high expectations and blow them out of the water with an emotionally thrilling finale. Get ready to be moved!",
            "The only thing that I know for sure has ended with the Marvel Cinematic Universe is my patience. ",
            "Endgame is nothing short of a deserved send-off to the Infinity Saga, stamping an impressive mark on the cultural psyche. It has been one hell of a ride.",
            "Part of the journey is the end, and this one is perfect for certain characters. An unprecedented movie in film history, and a very difficult feat to repeat. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Neither the best nor the worst of times in the franchise, it's a bit like a sugar rush. Endgame delivers both epics highs and a following crash that leaves you feeling oddly empty.",
            "It's that the movie itself is overblown and half-baked, and without the audience, it's something of a glorified in-joke.",
            "If Infinity War wanted to blow you away, Endgame wants to punch you in the gut and leave you a speechless, quivering wreck.",
            "The 22nd installment is a fittingly epic, three-hour finale that packs all of the fan service you could ever want, laced with somber tones and emotional payoffs that will cause even the genre's biggest detractors to shed a tear.",
            "It's one of the funniest movies of the 20-plus in the franchise, but it's also the one that made me the most emotional. But more than anything, it left me satisfied and thrilled that I kept watching them through the years.",
            "For fans of the most successful franchise in movie history, Avengers: Endgame delivers the world - and more.",
            "Epic and spectacular, an emotional rollercoaster that none of us will ever forget.",
            "Avengers: Endgame is the most 'superhero movie' superhero movie ever made.",
            "The film is almost three hours long; long enough to tie up loose ends, as well as give foundation to a new generation of Avengers. When all is said and done, this was the hardest goodbye in the Marvel Universe.",
            "A genuine, spectacular, and moving love letter from the Marvel family, the world of comics and the Russo brothers to modern pop culture. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "A good movie with a breathtaking third act for any comic book fan. ",
            "While there are a few ho-hum moments, there are equally stunning, stirring, triumphant ones where it's damn near impossible not to cheer.",
            "Overall, Endgame was a satisfying high-stakes adventure that was at times even unpredictable."

            "This up-for-anything sequel to the 2017 reboot brings back the A-list cast (Jack Black is still MVP) for more in-game avatar shenanigans. It's just the ticket if you're looking for a comic blast for the holidays. ",

            "Dizzying in its overlapping talk-talk-talk, incessant ambient din and translucent set design (glass is everywhere), the movie seems to radiate energy, heat, light and pressure -- it crushes scenes into diamonds.",

            "It's not Eastwood's finest hour.",
            "There is an elegant, even-handed character study buried within Clint Eastwood's crisp procedural about a security guard who becomes a hero - and then a pariah - after reporting a suspicious package at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia.",
            "In many ways, it is a very good story, efficiently told - and that's down to the excellent and very plausible performance from Paul Walter Hauser.",

            "A mostly successful return to form for Eastwood that overcomes its questionable characterizations and flawed execution of its arguments thanks to great performances and an incisive look on heroism.",
            "Richard Jewell was an ordinary hero who was never really afforded the opportunity to be truly ordinary or a hero. ",
            "Set in 1996, filled with brand name products, tense with worry but stuck at home, Richard Jewell is an accurate portrait of the U.S.A. Eastwood insists it hasn't changed much in twenty-three years.",
            "If you like drama and the tut-tutting of government over-reach and media slander, knock yourself out, but there are other movies that don't trick you into cheering the budding incel.",

            "Jonah Hill was originally slated to play Jewell, but Hauser's anonymity allows him to disappear into the character. A recognizable star would've felt too fake. And considering how many fabrications Richard Jewell weaves already, that's saying a lot."

            "A masterful, melancholy, tender, lacerating self-examination, filled with colour and light and the ghosts of those he has loved. Almodovar at 70, and perhaps astonishing to himself, continues to grow.",
            "Antonio Banderas gives his best, most committed performance in years as a film director looking back over his life in \"Pain and Glory,\" a typically rich, layered film from director Pedro Almod\u00f3var.",

            "Has the aesthetics that always characterize his style and some moments of affectivity, but it lacks emotional strength and I immediately perceive that it becomes self-indulgent with the story of the film director. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "It's sometimes funny and mostly pretty grim, but the patient pacing and wistful dialogue give even the bleakest moments a sense of bittersweet beauty. ",
            "Pain and Glory not only shows a brilliant artist still operating at the peak of his creative powers, but also reunites him with his most important male lead.",
            "Pain and Glory is a patient film, it quietly sits in wait, encouraging you to create new memories by revisiting your own old memories. ",
            "Banderas is the best part of the movie, with a tour-de-force performance...a master filmmaker forging a new path...",
            "We are seeing the world - in all its sadness and beauty - through his eyes. Banderas brings it all to life.",
            " As slow and meandering as the film feels at times, DP Jos\u00e9 Luis Alcaine's eye is a constant that enlivens the screen when the narrative struggles to.",
            " In his assemblage of the film, Almod\u00f3var imbues \"Pain & Glory\" with a wonderfully lyrical lilt. He weaves the film's many themes gracefully, with the measured contemplation of a musician putting together an album. ",
            "Like many of Almodovar's films, this one is emotional and personal. I think this film appeals to an older audience with its story about reconnecting with one's emotional center, after suffering despair brought on by age and medical problems.",
            "Courtesy of Almod\u00f3var's masterful direction and a career-finest performance from Banderas, we feel every moment with Salvador. The pain, the glory, and everything in-between."

            "Without diverting excessively from shonen's more traditional patterns, its excellent rhythm and way of executing every action set piece makes it an enjoyable watch. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "The film provides everything fans have come to expect from the franchise - over-the-top action, crazy super moves, and tensive show-downs.",
            "Of course, die hard fans will get a little more out of the nuances and callbacks, but the best thing you can say about My Hero Academia: Heroes Rising is that you may want to delve into the earlier works.",
            "It is a story of good versus evil told through the fascinating art of anime.",

            "Imaginative but violent anime adventure has some swearing",
            "On a primal level, it is still an absolute blast to watch these characters come into their own as heroes and unleash their powers in glorious, bonkers action time and time again.",

            "Gully Boy finds that promised land. It becomes the reality that most storytellers here can only dream of, and the dream that most artists yearn to realize. ",
            "Bollywood music holds sway over Indian listeners and this film ironically may help bring to mainstream the underground rap music flourishing currently. ",

            "\"How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World\" still has the power to warm a cold heart, but the fire is less bright.",
            "DeBlois struggles mightily to connect the resolution of one storyline to the resolution of the other, and it proves to be an overwhelming task. Still, it's a painless watch, with plenty of visual oohs and emotional aahs, and will surely leave fans happy.",
            "The message of the importance of peace and understanding couldn't be more timely yet there's a \"been there, done that\" vibe to the movie it can't completely shake.",

            "A fitting end to the much-loved series deliciously visual spectacular with an emotional arc of dog-like proportions.",
            "It's thrilling, adventurous, and poignant in all the right ways. There may be more popular animated properties, but few have been as consistently good as this has been for nearly a decade.",
            "A few small problems that do start to add up, but still a strong finish to a great trilogy. ",
            "It's one of those rare feats of storytelling where you don't simply feel like you've been on the traditional 'hero's journey' with the characters. It's more like a life journey, where the characters feel as though they're part of your family.",
            "Not as noteworthy as the previous ones but still important in its own way. A great closure. [Full review in Spanish].",
            "A perfect conclusion to one of the best animated series in cinema.",
            "There is sadness but there is joy to be had in The Hidden World, ending the franchise like on this high was the best way to say goodbye to Hiccup, Toothless and the gang.",
            "Overall, this feels like a sequel made for the sake of it with little by way of inspiration. It provides a neat conclusion to the larger story but is liable to leave fans of the original feeling short-changed.",
            "A satisfying conclusion with its themes of growing up and moving on that bring an emotional weight to the story.",
            "The kids who first discovered How to Train Your Dragon are teenagers now, contemplating their place in the world, and their animated friends have grown up with them.",
            "Thanks to Hiccup and Toothless, How to Train Your Dragon is Dreamworks' most endearing film series to date.",

            "The movie's coda cements the overarching message of extolling heroism and the survivors' refusal to let terror define them. But that moral still rings a little hollow.",
            "Hotel Mumbai is thoughtful and considered in its approach - more so, at least, than we usually expect from glossy adaptations of international tragedy.",
            "There is something queasy about mining such fresh real-life trauma for popcorn entertainment.",
            "It's a tense and sometimes moving directorial debut for Maras, an Australian who until now has specialised in shorts.",
            "Art born of outrage has to be more rigorous - and we might also contemplate what merit there is in guaranteeing prospective terrorists a filmed account of their misdeeds.",
            "Hotel Mumbai seems so determined to act like a bog-standard fictional siege thriller that you find yourself wondering why it isn't one. It might not have been all that memorable, but it would have felt considerably less grubby.",
            "Despite its lack of focus on its characters, Hotel Mumbai emerges as a very tense viewing experience.",
            "It dives right into the brutality without enough depth, making for an uneasy balance of real-life tragedy and titillating action fare.",
            "Although some scenes invite a minuscule moral reflection, it omits the causes to underline the effects, using a recalcitrant violence that at times falls into a trifle that prevents proper narrative development. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "At a certain point, it's impossible not to feel every death or injury in your gut. Hotel Mumbai does a great service in telling this story.",
            "[Dev Patel] brings the right mix of stoicism and bewilderment.",
            "Overall, Hotel Mumbai isn't an easy watch in the sense that it does bring back some very painful memories; but cinematically it is a solid and gritty retelling of an extremely tragic moment in our recent history. 4 Quints out of 5!",
            "At one point I started shaking in my seat. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Somehow it works. The film is a rollercoaster of emotion, inciting anger, fear and anxiety in the viewers.",
            "The characters aren't quite as strong as the pulse-racing plot.",
            "A brilliant new docudrama.",
            "Maras has crafted a film full of instances that are hard to forget: it's the shaping them into a story that still needs work.",
            "HOTEL MUMBAI is excellent at creating tension, but terrible at turning it into any meaningful empathy with or understanding of its wider roster of characters, despite the best efforts of Dev Patel.",
            "The star glitter notwithstanding, authenticity and generous production spend inform every frame.",
            "Much attention with this one: A fierce, almost unbearably intense recreation of the terrorist attacks in Mumbai in 2018. The characters don't get much development, but the story is as compelling as it gets.",
            "Hotel Mumbai doesn't exploit. It chronicles the randomness of violence, and the ordinary heroism and decency of people forced to confront terrorism. Everyone should see this movie, because it could happen to you. ",
            "This is a compelling drama, with some interesting characters. It is a story worth telling and movie worth seeing, because this could happen anywhere. I am surprised it hasn't happened in more places, especially in the United States.",
            "Hotel Mumbai grants an equally intense subjectivity to its young terrorists as to their victims. Their callous fanaticism is only underscored when Maras reveals them as na\u00efve doofuses...",
            "This was a tough movie to sit through...this is a proper thriller, with each beat and moment landing..."

            "A kind of cinematic personal testimony, told from Johnson's post-conversion point of view...crafted specifically for Pure Flix's target audience, an audience that is already pro-life.",

            "There's a lot of money on the screen, Angelina Jolie is once again really good in the film, the musical score is great, and some of the action sequences are cool. But the story this time around is even less investing than last time.",

            "The rest is a sluggish film noir pastiche (the setting of the novel has been inexplicably shifted from the late Nineties to the Fifties) that aims to emulate the jazzy intrigue of Chinatown, but delivers only clich\u00e9s and screen-chewing vanity.",
            "As it is, his passionate commitment to the story has resulted in the very definition of a vanity project.",
            "Its homage to film noir is over-the-top and borderline parodic -- at times, it's more Who Framed Roger Rabbit? than Chinatown.",
            "It took Norton two decades to get Motherless Brooklyn made, and the result is a film that's wondrously out of time: one in which the hero isn't out to save the world, just understand it.",

            "Overall, it's a complicated story that unfolds beautifully.",
            "This isn't my usual fare of film, but I do love a good story that manages to be exciting as well as touching without all of that touchy-feely nonsense.",
            "A detective story that gets a little lost in the dark, but when it finds a footing, it's hard not to become intrigued.",
            "This could have been a great film with a more experienced director.",
            "Motherless Brooklyn is in general, a well-constructed, atmospheric film. Norton has assembled an admirable cast of characters...",
            "It is a detective film that can be seen, but doesn't escape the conventional. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "If only Edward Norton the producer had told Edward Norton the screenwriter to streamline Edward Norton the star's lines a bit, Edward Norton the director might have had a mini masterpiece on his hands.",
            "Unlike \"Chinatown,\" the hero of \"Motherless Brooklyn\" is not the strong, silent type like Jack Nicholson. Instead, Lionel grapples withTourette's syndrome.",
            "Norton sacrifices substance for style, and even style for stylishness. So, there's a lot to behold but little to contemplate.",
            "A genuine and elegant noir film that excels due to the endearing personality of the main character and excellent production design. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "At a time when some politicians celebrate an idealized vision of 1950s white Americana as a way to justify discrimination, it follows that a 1950s film noir is an effective format for a social critique.",
            "This beautifully crafted, deliciously compelling, chillingly atmospheric film noir is a fabulous showcase and reminder of the talented 50-year-old actor.",
            "Although it's worth watching... the balance between the languid tone and its protagonist's stuttering is not sustained during the two and a half hours of footage. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Edward Norton's sincere, hyper-stylised approach is both lovingly old-fashioned and refreshingly modern, crafting an impressive and thoroughly riveting mystery. ",
            "When Norton set aside the lead role for himself he was 39. Today he is 50. If we're not overly conscious of his age that's because the character, Lionel Essrog, is one of literature's more unusual private detectives.",
            "Edward Norton's drawn-out filming of Jonathan Lethem's 1999 novel has much to admire, but a bloated running time and some odd choices prevent it from being a proper neo noir masterpiece.",
            "A collection of characters that feel misplaced in a movie whose genre is a mystery. [Full review in Spanish].",
            "Tedious and way too long, this patchy period crime drama directed by and starring the usually impressive Edward Norton unspools like a by-the-numbers tele-movie."

            "Despite its predictability, it conveys what it's like to be enraptured by a rock idol. ",

            "\"Blinded by the Light\" represents such a sweet, easy-to-relate-to story that it deserves to be seen, at the least, by anyone who has shown a little faith that there's magic in the arts -- either in music, or a darkened theater.",
            "What promised to be an entertainingly charming film turned out to be nothing more than a dull homage to \"The Boss.\" ",
            "The direction by Gurinder Chadha finds a perfect balance between optimism and sensibility.",

            "Blinded by the Light is an enjoyable movie, although at times his single-minded focus on Springsteen - he even starts dressing like his idol - rather than opening himself to other musicians and music, seems oddly limited.",

            "As gloriously euphoric as the finest of Bruce's anthems.",
            "Blinded by the Light is exceedingly earnest; it doesn't wear its heart on its sleeve so much as shouts its feelings from the rooftops.",

            "These themes have preoccupied Linklater through his whole career -- and while Where'd You Go, Bernadette may not be one of his peaks, it shows he's still bent on approaching them in new ways.",
            "[I]n a cinematic landscape where stories of women finding themselves are too few and far between, Where'd You Go, Bernadette is a welcome gift, even if it's an imperfect one.",
            "Basically a miscalculation from end to end, full of bizarre narrative turns and inexplicable craft decisions. Yet there's never any question that Linklater is fully committed, and it's hard to consider a movie \"bad\" that's made with this much care. ",
            "Bernadette is a vibrant creative spirit, and Blanchett blithely gives the character her all.",
            "As Bernadette, Cate Blanchett is forced to do the work that Linklater doesn't devote to developing the story or characters. ",
            "Linklater understands that it's not where you ended up but what brought you there - and what you do when you get there - that really matters.",
            "This misguided comedy gets off to a strong start and then self-destructs in record time as what was initially charming soon becomes grating and irritating. ",
            "Where'd You Go, Bernadette might lure in fans of the book but as someone coming to the material with no background knowledge, I was disappointed.",
            "I'm happy to report that Where'd You Go, Bernadette is a pretty well assembled and often very well written film, with a towering performance from Blanchett at its heart.",
            "Fans of the novel may take umbrage at the considerable narrative streamlining Linklater and his co-writers have applied to the film's third act, but the changes make for a thrilling and satisfying resolution. ",
            "It isn't that Linklater has delivered a disaster, but there's an irascible feeling that someone -- nay, almost everyone -- behind the scenes was phoning it in.",
            "Even Blanchett's performance is not enough for the drama to have a cohesive solution. In the end it is somewhat conventional. It's a minor Linklater movie. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "It's easy to see why Cate Blanchett was drawn to such a project - especially with Richard Linklater... But his film adaptation of Maria Semple's satirical novel about motherhood and ambition is uncharacteristically ham-fisted.",
            "Peppered with zany touches that irk more often than they delight, the film lacks the wily spark that infuses Linklater's best work. ",
            "...while it isn't nearly as funny as the book, Blanchett is so likably crazed you may enjoy it anyway...",
            "Strong politics and an empathy for his characters help Linklater imprint his personal style on this adaptation. [Full Review in Spanish] ",
            "Cate Blanchett has her fingers on the pulse as a lost woman who rediscovers her creativity and her corresponding self-love.",
            "The posed question of Where'd You Go, Bernadette? isn't one that we feel the need to answer, rather we'd listen to the response with middling enthusiasm.",
            "I don't know if Where'd You Go, Bernadette is one of the worst films of the year, but it is definitely one of the most disappointing.",
            "In the Texas filmmaker's hands, learning to love [Bernadette]... inevitable. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Linklater is a filmmaker who continues to grow and make distinct and singular features that are often sublime, like Bernadette, an absolute triumph of a film about artists and the way they're treated (and mistreated by most of society).",
            "Yet another example of [Richard Linklater's] versatility. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "The combination of the powerful story and Cate Blanchett's finely-tuned acting made Bernadette sing.",
            "[Richard] Linklater is trying to rook us all into believing this is a universally heartwarming scenario. The unfathomably wealthy can be heroes, he says. That is, until the peasants sack the White Palace that Bernadette designed."

            "The mounting fear and isolation of the Cheadle character puts us in an interesting place: the war on terror is reconfigured as a tussle of the soul.",
            "Writer-director Jeffrey Nachmanoff bends over backwards to be even-handed, but his attempts at balance come over as earnestly unsubtle.",
            "[Traitor] is, however, a solid thriller, exhilarating when it needs to be and entertaining throughout, with another exemplary performance from Cheadle at its heart.",
            "The more I think about this movie, the better it gets.",
            "Traitor succeeds in painting a multihued, nuanced picture that is much more satisfying than paint-by-numbers conclusions.",
            "...one can't help but embrace the slow-moving narrative to an increasingly palpable degree.",
            "Simmers down into a reasonably smart little thriller with a moral conscience, yet.",
            "If it doesn't succeed in challenging you perception of the war on terror, it might challenge your view on Steve Martin.",
            "Surprisingly, Steve Martin created this story. In a decade of wild and crazy fictional terrorism, his was the most horrifyingly plausible - one that spun terrorism as drama into uncomfortable community theater, striking the country's friendliest corners.",
            "We watch for the sake of the chase, and while it's a chase that certainly proves better than most, it's also one that is good enough to have been even better than that.",
            "As a thriller, Traitor excels and feels especially relevant, considering the subject matter.",
            "The action scenes will grab you, but there's an actual story here, too.",
            "A certain interest resides in the film's even-handedness.",
            "As the eponymous terrorist, Cheadle makes a big impact without too much noise.",
            "Traitor is undeniably an intelligent, watchable thriller that wisely steers clear of racial stereotyping, yet manages to fall short of delivering a wholly satisfying cerebral or visceral experience.",
            "The result is an absorbing, old-fashioned drama without the gung-ho rhetoric you might have expected.",
            "A globe-trotting conspiracy thriller that is a little too complicated for its own good.",
            "Strong turns from Cheadle and Pearce elevate an ambitious suspenser with a keen eye for the duplicities that propel the War On Terror. The risible ending, alas, is pure wish-fulfillment hokum, while the solitary female character is barely a cipher."

            "The doco is at its very best when it gets to show us plenty of Pavarotti in his showstopping, heart-starting prime, peaking with his work with the incomparable Joan Sutherland and (most famously of all) as part of The Three Tenors. ",

            "Pavarotti was the Babe Ruth of tenors, and with Opie behind the wheel, there's an element of fandom that creeps into the mix - by keeping things out of the mix. ",
            "...a marvelous documentary that strikes the perfect balance to please both opera-loving Pavarotti fans who know his work well and those who are new to opera...",
            "It is done respectfully and lovingly, with the occasional criticism that he could be demanding.",
            "Pavarotti is a delight. At times hard to watch, but ever so entertaining and explosive exploring one of the most captivating and astonishing artists of the 20th century and showcasing every nook and cranny it can to fully realise such an iconic performer.",
            "Watching Ron Howard's celebratory, crowd-pleasing, hagiographic documentary Pavarotti, I wished I could see Kapadia's interpretation of the same facts, to get a glimpse into the real story.",
            "It's a lovely tribute from one superstar-tenor to another from an earlier generation."

            "This is not about the destination. It is about the journey, and it's a long, painful one. It is about more than just losing weight and running the distance, although that is hard enough. It is a long movie, but the characters make it worth the time.",
            "Brittany Runs a Marathon is such an unexpected surprise of the year, blending the elements of comedy and heart together with utmost skill. ",
            "As someone who has gone through a similar weight loss transformation, it really gets it right in terms of the personal shame you feel, the guilt, the emotional eating, and the perseverance it takes to accomplish a personal transformation.",
            "Brittany Runs a Marathon gives Bell a lot of smart comic business, but her character's humour is signalled from the first as a way of deflecting pain - and is often funny because it's so mistimed that the people around her don't get the joke.",
            "It is perfect, however, for viewers who enjoy slice-of-life films about flawed characters you can't help but cheer on.",

            "It can't quite get itself tonally right...it didn't gel for me, but there are individual moments that are quite funny.",

            "Blue Story, at its essence, is a narrative you've seen before. But Onwubolu vests it with firecracker energy-the pace never drags, even when you think you know what's going to happen next.",
            "It's a Shakespearean rhapsody in indigo where love, friendship, betrayal and revenge swirl and blur with life-changing consequences.",
            "The film has a powerful sense of place, with details that feel authentic and, in some cases, lived through.",
            "Aside from these compelling young actors, the success here is the fresh and original voice of Rapman, who has said \"Blue Story\" is largely based on his own life...",
            "If you want a blast of pure nitro in your pandemic viewing, start streaming this standout first feature from rapper-director-actor Andrew Onwubolu, a.k.a. Rapman, who uses hip-hop beats to bring mythic weight to this British youth-gang drama",
            "It's brutal, raw, and often hard to watch - and hard to understand at times. However, it is striking and will stay with you well after you watch it. The storytelling, with narrative hip hop interludes from Rapman is totally unique and fresh.",
            "A strong debut from Rapman, who shows an eye for visual dynamics, an ear for tone and a sense of swift, energized pacing - all signs of exceptional auteurism.",
            "Through rhyme and reason with Rapman in his element, Blue Story is a carefully articulated piece of art that should be judged on its own merits. And if you still feel that this film glamorises gang culture, then you haven't been paying attention.",
            "In an overabundance of movies and TV shows that portray Black men as criminals, Blue Story sets itself apart by having well-developed characters and believable acting that give this story more depth than the run-of-the-mill gangster film. ",
            "If the theme of Blue Story is the perpetuating and destructive cycle of revenge, it does well in convincing the power of its poison.",

            "Blue Story's ambitions therefore far outweigh its minor faults. And with this execution and knack for artistic flare, Rapman may be a talent to watch out for in the future.",
            "Love, loss, family and friendship ferociously collide, without distracting us from either its fun or energy. It's a balancing act only a rapper could pull off. ",
            "Blue Story can be messy in stretches, but it's undeniably passionate and carried by its simple, yet effective, and sometimes lyrical storytelling.",
            "A natural and spontaneous feel is accentuated by the foot-thumping musical score by Jonathon Deering. Also, characters sing or rap in-between dramatic scenes with lyrics that augment feelings and plot points. Call it \"rap narration.\"",

            "Rough-hewn but bursting with urgency.",
            "It may be rough around the edges and a bit shallow at times, but no one can deny its passion.",
            "Blue Story doesn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to films about turf wars, but its personal, humanizing themes about friendship, love, youth, and black masculinity keeps you riveted, Onwubolu's lyrical respites aside.",
            "Blue Story is a powerful and important British drama that truly packs an emotional punch, highlighting the needless tragedy and consequences of gang culture.",
            "A lyrical, moving and unflinching film that lays bare the terrifying, tightening pull of gang culture on teenage boys."

            "Director Alex Holmes gracefully cuts back and forth from stirring archival footage of the Whitbread Round the World Yacht Race as cameras get up close and personal with the female crew. ",
            "Luckily, this isn't the type of film that coasts on its inherently interesting story. It's edited with gusto, lining up its talking heads to emulate conversations.",
            "Without revealing too much, it's fair to say Maiden, Edwards and her crew did better than most people expected.",
            "It's interesting to watch Tracy Edwards' maturation as a person -- she goes from claiming that she hates the word \"feminist\" to wholeheartedly embracing it.",
            "What a revelation... It's quite stunning. ",
            "[T]his is a thrilling story filled with heart-warming ups and anxiety-inducing downs.",
            "Forget tales of drug-addled footballers and former All Black first five-eighths, this is the sporting documentary you need to see right now.",
            "Like a rising tide, thrilling archival footage and still-timely female-empowerment themes lift the compelling documentary Maiden beyond the timeworn tropes of the underdog sports drama.",
            "Exaltation, not outrage, is the primary experience of this film.",
            "For anyone who doesn't boat much, it's hard to grasp how yachting can be athletic, harrowing, admirable, or lethal. Maiden... makes a good case for the prowess, invention, and perseverance required.",
            "An inspiring look at an unsung trailblazer.",
            "This is an engrossing and inspiring saga , one that leaves the viewer with a profound respect for the men (and women) who go down to the sea in ships.",
            "The boat was skippered by a former short-order cook whose early life struggles deserve to make a quite compelling feature film some day soon. Her all-female crew also gives ample room for actresses to play them with strength and guts.",
            "Maiden transcends the rousing underdog sports story genre and offers an intriguing look at a stubbornly persistent sporting culture; one characterized by mindsets as outdated as its technology.",
            "Conventional non-fiction filmmaking aside, the story, players, and imagery are assembled in such a thoughtful manner that the results are frequently thrilling and inspiring.",
            "What you especially appreciate about [Tracy] Edwards is her fierce love of boating and her steely resolve to succeed. You watch the riveting film and wonder how anyone could have doubted that she would, indeed, sail around the world.",
            " 'Maiden' is most compelling when it takes us out to sea. ... The battle between sailors and the ocean is a full-time, life-and-death struggle. Storms and waves can wreck a yacht or claim a life by washing a person overboard."

            "It's almost like Shakespeare wrote this movie.",
            "The movie's impressive appearance notwithstanding, Shakespeare's domestic problems do not a classic make.",
            "Apart from fleeting pleasures, All Is True is mostly a goodie bag stuffed for Shakespeare completists.",
            "But mostly what \"All is True\" does is give viewers is a fresh look at Shakespeare, behind the guise, flaws and all. And if ever there was a man for that job, it's Branagh.",
            "\"All is True\" is expertly acted and handsomely filmed but suffers from an excess of sentimentality, a rash of revelations, and a surfeit of subtext, with characters blurting out the hidden motives for their behavior instead of simply behaving them.",
            "A fake schnoz significantly alters Branagh's appearance as the Bard of Avon, but his career-long interest in Shakespeare shines through.",
            "It is a diverting, fitfully thought-provoking look at Shakespeare at a point in his life that many of us may not be aware of, powered by a sense of poignancy and exceptional performances across the board.",
            "This is a joyously overwrought and theatrical movie, which finds its best moments when it deals in ripe, gently bawdy dialogue.",
            "Engulfed in bitter sadness and sweet sentimentality which, at times, loses itself to overwhelming grief.",
            "This era's paragon of Shakespeare performers is able to take All is True to a new realm and humanize an iconic historical figure.",
            "Branagh's pacing, intended as idyllic I guess, is glacial... That said, the acting is magnificent, from Dench and McKellan and the other supporting players, but above all from the star. ",
            "Kenneth Branagh transforms into Shakespeare and delivers one of the best films of his career. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "While the themes might be hammered home too much at times, they are still compelling and interesting, and hammered home by some incredible actors, decked out in gorgeous costumes and more wigs than an episode of RuPaul's Drag Race.",
            "All Is True ultimately has more in common with The Real Housewives of Atlanta than with The Merry Wives of Windsor.",
            "Sir Kenneth Branagh's All is True is a splendid little treat for Shakespeare fans, especially for those who've always wanted to know a little more about the man himself.",
            "Ben Elton's well-researched and cleverly built script offers plenty of delights for fans of the Bard, further enhanced with Branagh's fine direction and its wonderful cast.",
            "An intriguing take on Shakespeare's final days.",
            "Honestly there were times when it seemed a half step away from a Monty Python or Blackadder sketch",
            "\"Macbeth\" and \"King Lear\" didn't exactly stick to the historical record either, and Ben Elton's speculative screenplay finds poignancy and wit in this unauthorized and unexpected portrait of Shakespeare.",
            "These guys know their Bard, and they've come up with a wonderful homage -- witty, atmospheric, at times heartbreaking -- to both the towering genius of myth and the oh-so-fallible man within.",
            "Vintage shameless Branagh, borderline unwatchable, but also a weirdly perfect cap to a career built on flavorless yet vainglorious Shakespeare adaptations.",
            "Much as with Anne Rice's The Young Messiah, the film's use of an historical frame adds nothing vital to its story and creates an expectation of truth adjacency that it lacks the skill or imagination to meet.",
            "Kenneth Branagh plays William Shakespeare in dullish but, still, interesting fashion.",
            "Director Branagh and screenwriter Ben Elton spin a decent yarn that concludes \"Family is everything\" instead of \"The play's the thing.\""

            "Reminiscent of Ingmar Bergman with its substantive style, AFTER THE WEDDING provides a focused perspective of life.",
            "Takes aim at the rich one percent though the movie is not as entertaining as the Danish version.",
            "There's nothing quite as devastating as tragedy treated with sharp and precise Northern European restraint.",
            "As a critic, I don't always have the luxury of choosing everything I see. And a lucky thing, too, because director Susanne Bier's After the Wedding is making a strong argument that my instincts about Danish cinema are wrong wrong wrong.",
            "Une oeuvre aussi sinc\u00e8re que les intentions de ses protagonistes qui \u00e9pate par l'efficacit\u00e9 d'une mise en sc\u00e8nes dont les rouages se veulent enti\u00e8rement au service du discours",

            "One of the very best films to be released in America in the first third of 2007.",
            "After the Wedding is seamless, holding our attention, engaging our emotions and satisfying our cinematic needs with a story of human weakness, strength, heart and the capriciousness of fate",
            "Every scene is kissed with irony, the characters all seem believably flawed, the narrative unfolds with just the right storytelling panache and everything else about the production seems right.",
            "Those willing to overlook its emotional grandstanding will find much to admire and even more to think about in this Oscar-nominated Danish drama.",
            "Some of the scenes are downright devastating, as the various characters come to terms with their own choices. It's not nearly as spectacular as other contemporary Danish films, but the craft and acting bring it above the genre in which it slips.",

            "Bier [is] the latest in a long line of filmmakers who have mastered the art of making movies about people we can all thank God we're not.",
            "The portent of [director] Bier's unyielding vision may turn some viewers off, but she has the extraordinarily moving story to warrant the self-conscious artiness.",
            "Helene, caught like Jacob between lives, spends much of the film trying to explicate choices that now look only wrong."

            "It just tells a great story and has beautiful moments of powerful emotion that can bring a tear to the eye even 65 years after it was made.",
            "Viewed in isolation, Dumbo feels like a practice feature film from animators whose only previous experience was short subjects.",
            "In its scant 64-minute running time, the big top melodrama of Dumbo reduces me to a blubbering, mucus-drizzling wreck at least once with every viewing.",

            "The scrappy filmmaking and petty criminal antics fit the scale of this Gomorrah Jr.",
            "It flashes potential on both sides of the camera, but this gritty Italian crime thriller is conventional beneath its mildly unsettling surface.",

            "A whiff of the stage still clings to the characters' intellectual tussling, but it is very well acted, endlessly stimulating and, at this present juncture, extremely timely.",
            "[Onah] and Lee don't have enough of a grasp on melodrama, though, making for an after-school special with tons of untapped potential.",
            "[Julius Onah] provokes and pokes fun at our outwardly progressive beliefs by revealing all the unfounded, pre-conceived notions and fears rooted in our so-called liberal discourse.",
            "By addressing some of the more subtle, pernicious forms of racism, it doesn't let audiences off the hook with simple solutions, and it might make so-called progressives a little uncomfortable about their own latent biases.",
            "Luce is one of the biggest surprises of 2019. It's a socio-psychological thriller that intensifies like a ticking bomb. ",
            "Writer/director Julius Onah (The Girl is in Trouble) has a lot to say, but, with this powerhouse cast, he saves some of his best moments for the quiet spaces, between the words. Very recommended.",
            "The sky's the limit for [Kelvin Harrison Jr.]...",
            "Very impressed by this. Surprised by this film, with all its twists and turns...it wasn't as complex, but it was definitely terrifying...",
            "It's a film that wants you to remain as unsure of yourself as you are of the people it introduces - all the while insisting you fill in the gaps and provide the answers.",
            "This is a really chilling psychological thriller that illuminates racism in American in a different way than more common approaches. It asks, 'What is the cost of submerging one's identity, history and race in order to conform to white standards?'",
            "There's a rare intelligence to this film, which explores issues around race, wealth, class, gender and what it means to be a real American in a nuanced, multifaceted way. ",
            "This smart, racially-charged drama digs into the underbelly of our woke age.",
            "... almost made me indifferent to the topics in question, as well as unfulfilled.",
            "Watts and Spencer have some excellent scenes, crackling with energy and unarticulated tension, but the language can feel overburdened with significance.",
            "Its racial aspects make for uncomfortable viewing."

            "It's a movie that celebrates small things, while also acknowledging the larger injustices of life, and reinforcing the importance of connection. ",
            "Ever feel invisible in plain sight navigating through life with no one really noticing your existence? Invisible Life beautifully captures the love and life of two sisters and the strength of women under the most dire of circumstances. Loved it!!!",
            "Movies need to fill our hearts with love before they can break them. Invisible Life does both.",
            "A\u00efnouz imbues Invisible Life with an intimacy that's at once blunt about bodily needs and evocative of the lushness of inner lives.",

            "This story of lost and missed opportunities should have more of an emotional heft that binds you to the characters. Unfortunately, at times, the movie feels distant, as if director Karim A\u00efnouz is content to simply allow you to watch events unfold.",
            "The acting is very good in this movie, and the story is compelling, if somewhat far-fetched and overlong (140 minutes). I would have liked this movie more if it was more believable, and had a shorter running time.",
            "It's an enchanting experience, one that emphasises the power of hope in times of helplessness and the importance of love above all else.",
            "Julia Stockler and Carol Duarte bring the pining sisters to life in nearly every frame.",

            "Invisible Life lives or dies on Louvart's images, and it's her sensitivity for color and composition that elevates the film from a rather straightforward arthouse melodrama into something more effusive and mysterious. ",
            "\"Invisible Life\" is a rich film that will reward patient viewers who love a juicy melodrama. ",
            "It'd feel like a tragedy if weren't so real, and that's the point.",
            "In all, Invisible Life makes for a moving look at a bond that endures despite out-dated rules and a father's uncompromising rigidity.",

            "Two sisters with the most intimate of bonds are separated by societal mandate but never lose their connection.",
            "The film's modulated softness, its moments of quiet heartfelt sorrow, are testaments to a feminism that rejects political anger in order to embrace sisterly compassion."

            "Knives Out deserves to be explored as a world of it own, as Johnson balances moral conscience and black humor expertly within the constraints of the murder-mystery genre.",
            "There's a great deal of lively and funny shenanigans with poisons and antidotes, and Johnson delivers a stab of cheerful cynicism.",
            "An entertainment that's as smart, witty, stylish and exhilarating as any movie lover could wish for.",
            "I suspect that Johnson, an adolescent genre enthusiast to his core, has waited since age 10 to make a movie like this. His enjoyment is contagious, even for those of us who don't think Knives Out quite hits its marks.",
            "Knives Out is a whole lot of fun, intended to keep the audience off-balance right up until the finish. It's a razor-sharp throwback from writer-director Rian Johnson.",

            "Knives Out provides mysterious thrills while offering a timely critique of entitled white privilege.",
            " Everything old can be new again, and Knives Out demonstrates this brilliantly due to Rian Johnson's airtight script, assured direction and the commitment from the crazily talented cast. Foul play has never been this much fun.",
            "This whodunit is light entertainment at its finest, a surprising movie with an enjoyable sense of complication and a dream cast.",
            "Rian Johnson proves himself to be one of contemporary cinema's most creative, inspired, disciplined, and downright entertaining filmmakers working today. ",
            "This modern twist on an old classic understands that the genre's formulas are fertile ground on which to hang strident critiques of privilege and class.",
            "Rian Johnson (\"Looper\") delivers a star-studded romp that rises above the standard \"Clue\" whodunnit by revealing the culprit early on, then watching the aftermath.",
            "Rian Johnson's Knives Out is an energetic blast, not only a landmark undertaking in skill, craft, nuance, and entertaining hilarity but makes a confident and exceptional call to be considered as one of the best films of the year.",
            "A knowing nudge-wink that leans heavily into the genre's well-worn threads before pulling the rug out from underneath you repeatedly, Knives Out is at once a glowing tribute and a smart re-tooling of the formula by Johnson.",
            "In its criticism of the rich for their avarice, xenophobia and general lack of humanity, Knives Out turns out to be more than a run-of-the-mill mystery yarn.",
            "The all-star cast takes turns chewing the scenery. Daniel Craig nearly steals the film as Benoit Blanc. If film fans are wondering if there is life after James Bond for Daniel Craig, the answer is a resounding YES.",
            "The resolution...seems a long time coming, and it isn't quite the out-of-left-field surprise you might have hoped for. Still, writer/director Rian Johnson keeps his audience sufficiently off-balance to make things interesting.",
            "Knives Out is not only a throwback to classic murder mysteries, but a well-calibrated genre exercise truly meant for these troubling times. Though the text feels retro, the subtext feels unapologetically contemporary.",
            "Knives Out is a brilliant whodunnit film that is so much fun to unwrap and piece together. With a stellar cast, some killer humor, and a mild political undertone - it's surely set to entertain everyone.",
            "If you like mystery novels, you will love this film, otherwise... you will love it too. [Full review in Spanish]",

            "A bizarre, off-centre, singularly demented pitch-black comedy...it's superbly mounted by writer/director Quentin Dupieux, whose sense of the deranged is dispatched with a cool matter-of-fact air that makes the proceedings as disturbing as they are funny.",

            "An absurdist riff on Hollywood's toxic narratives of masculinity and machismo",
            "This slyly paranoid art film proposes what cannot be put back in order -- or, as an amateur filmmaker might think, rectified by pressing a rewind button. It defies back-to-roots, back-to-nature aspirations and so goes forward into murderous madness.",
            "Deerskin is completely bizarre. A story that baffles as much as it intrigues, but it is carried off flawlessly by Jean Dujardin who is selling the hell out of it.",

            "The leads are superb, and Balagov exhibits a masterful touch beyond his years.",
            "[Director/co-writer] Kantemir Balagov has created a story that may be about what happens after the war but there is no grit, grim or absolute misery which sometimes dominates this genre but there is pain, love, and delicate bond that hopefully will last.",

            "There is no light touch here, but by the time you reach the film's final 20 minutes, it has earned its fever-dream intensity.",
            "The movie's fluid camerawork, set detail, and deeply saturated greens and shocking reds help mitigate the gloom. And the acting is top-notch, especially considering that most of the players are non-professionals. ",

            "Bagalov's directorial vision and voice are bold and compelling. Beanpole is infused with a profoundly tender intimacy, interspersed with stark portrayals of pain, cruelty, and sacrifice. And yet these hard-to-watch moments never feel lurid or gratuitous.",
            "The issues addressed are troubling and often inhuman, but stick with it, not just for the story, but for the oddly moving respects Balagov pays to real-life female warriors. For them, \"Beanpole\" stands as a towering tribute. "

            "...a fairly disappointing missed opportunity.",

            "Young Ahmed can't resist the odd moment of melodrama, which sometimes feels out of place in an otherwise undiluted piece of social realism. This might not be vintage Dardennes, but it is still one of their most daring works to date.",
            "Ahmed poses many difficult questions-about the nature of evil, rehabilitation, and the limits of empathy-that it leaves the audience to answer. ",

            "The performances are uniformly naturalistic and beautifully poignant. Introverted to the point of near-unreadability, with traces of feeling revealing a deep well of insecurity, Idir Ben Addi is magnificent in the lead. ",

            "[Some] sequences have a gleam and a rhythm to them that encapsulates Disney animation at its purest and most sinuous. The film itself doesn't hit that sweet spot that makes Pixar animations, for example, fun for adults as well as their children. ",

            "...one of the most beautifully animated films of the decade, filled with stunning visual pyrotechnics and incredible attention to detail. ",
            "Because the first movie generated such a bracing gust of enthusiasm, Frozen 2 will inevitably be nitpicked and judged against those lofty standards. Still, there's plenty to enjoy for those willing to chill out, and yes, let the past go.",
            "Disney's 'Frozen 2' far exceeds the original animated film. The character development, storyline and the overall themes are more nuanced, detailed and intriguing. There are some scenes that may insight fear in smaller kids, but overall it's kid-friendly.",
            "Frozen 2 brings the strenghts of the first movie and takes them further (...). It's more balanced so kids and adults can enjoy the journey. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "There's no question the Littles will enjoy Frozen 2. It's plenty colorful, even if it did feel long. I say \"feel long\" because it's only 103 minutes, but a lot is going on.",
            "Disney has managed an impressive act of tightrope walking in following up their latest golden goose with something that shimmers almost as brightly",
            "It's a sweet tale of sisters doing it for themselves with a melancholic hinting at how childhood's innocence gives way to the concerns of the world and their place in it.",
            "A beautiful and very entertaining animated sequel that makes me have a nice time for a magical hour and a half. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Frozen II may sing about change, but that progress is what you project onto it.",
            " \"Frozen II\" is sure to please the kiddies and their parents with catchy tunes and wondrous animation, even if it makes the plot more complicated than it needs to be for its target audience.",
            "Frozen 2 may not warm the cockles of your heart quite to the extent that Frozen did, but it will, if you sit back and let it sweep over you, take your breath away.",
            "They try to throw a lot at you, but very little is focused.",
            "There's a whole lot of charm in this, but it follows the original's winning formula a little too closely that it feels almost repetitive.",
            "Although the sequel is no match with the 2013 original, \"Frozen II\" remains a decent sequel that - at least, thankfully - doesn't feel like a blatant cash grab after all. ",
            "Frozen II is a solid follow up to a brilliant film, managing to surpass the original in a lot of ways, while also being weaker in many other ways. ",
            "A visually marvellous work, with stunning imagery and design.",
            "A distressingly unnecessary (and fairly tedious) sequel...",

            "[A]n ultimately satisfying story of more mature themes for an audience that's grown out of the dress-up stage.",

            "Coming less than a year after her death, Timothy Greenfield-Sanders' film can't help being an elegy - but a celebration, too, of a woman acutely of her times and always a step ahead of them.",
            "It's incisive, it's precise, and it's honest",
            "A celebratory portrait of author Toni Morrison painted by those who knew her, this compelling documentary also explores how her work gives such a powerful voice to the African American experience.",
            "[A] fitting tribute to a national treasure.",
            "While there is nothing overly innovative in the documentary's form or presentation, Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am is an articulate, funny, and powerful celebration of one of America's premier literary forces. ",
            "I recommend it to anyone. If you feel that it can inspire you or touch you, it will. If you just want a pleasant watch, it works well for that too. All of this hammers in what a loss it was to lose her last year.",
            "'A writer's life and work are not a gift to mankind; they are its necessity,' wrote Morrison, and this film acts as an essential record for both the initiated and those not already acquainted with her work.",
            "It's a film that will inspire people to read more of her work but, perhaps more importantly, it's a film that will inspire people to write.",
            "Complicated, difficult, necessary reckoning is at the core of her work."

            "Tyrnauer tells Cohn's story through interviews with family members and colleagues, and makes it very clear that he's indirectly telling the story of Trump. This expos\u00e9 of \"a personality in disarray\" is a two-for-one deal.",
            "The documentary tells the story of Cohn, his life and career, and it's a grim saga.",

            "Director Matt Tyrnauer once again displays a remarkable ability to rummage around in our country's recent past as if it were an untidy closet, extracting painful mementos.",

            "There's nothing much new here, including the implication that Cohn was a key factor in the introduction of the combative, zero-sum style of modern politics. The film does manage, however -- maybe unintentionally -- to evoke a certain pity for Cohn.",

            "Lawyer Cohn apparently pulled many malicious stunts in his life. Now director Tyrnauer, whose sex swipes at dead movie stars in his last documentary somehow seemed credible, delivers a real hitjob that remains more absorbing than on point. ",
            "The film delivers high-speed tabloid journalism and rolls along swiftly. It's jammed with information that make shock the unknowing. ",

            "[F]or every scholar who talks about the social implications of Fiddler and the resilience that birthed it, there's one that spells out baseline interpretations of the text.",
            "I've adored Fiddler since childhood, so I watched this film with great pleasure. The only downside was that I wanted to hear the numbers all the way through. When it was over, I was ready for the show to start.",

            "Miracle of Miracles feeds the soul and explains in depth why a play like Fiddler on the Roof will always be a theatrical treasure.",
            "This film will be a treasure trove of insight into not just the making of a musical, but of women and men who had the courage of their convictions in the face of odds set against them.",
            "Max Lewkowicz's film, \"Fiddler: A Miracle of Miracles\" demonstrates, with great affection and sometimes exhaustive detail, just how this tale of a poor milkman named Tevye and his relationship with God, became a world-wide hit.",
            "It reminds us of why \"Fiddler\" is so enduring simply through the characters, story, and music that will still be touching audiences in another 50 years.",
            "A convincing theme of this informative and emotional documentary is that the 1964 musical \"Fiddler on the Roof\" is a \"female empowerment piece\".... with feminist portrayals.",
            "This documentary film feels like a joyous and edifying game of musical chairs. The one left standing is the monumental 1964 Broadway juggernaut, \"Fiddler On The Roof.\" ",
            "A loving salute to a show that has understandably retained its place in the public's affection for more than half a century.",
            "...a treat for fans of the musical, but it offers more, with its wealth of background and archival materials and thoughtful insights on how a musical about the life of a Jewish dairyman and his family in a shtetl became something that spoke to the world.",
            "Overall, \"Fiddler: A Miracle of Miracles\" will be best appreciated by fans of the musical, but [Max] Lewkowicz's effort, like the musical itself, should carry an appeal that will be relatable outside of Broadway circles."

            "The stakes this time turn out to be considerably lower, and your friendly neighborhood Spider-Teen is arguably just the guy to bring things down to Earth and reestablish a human scale.",
            "I like that \"Far From Home\" is trying something new and that its humor feels more real than the ironic cracks in most superhero movies. I just wish its good pieces all came together more satisfyingly.",
            "Even with a plot that builds off the emotional heft of Endgame, another mediocre villain, heavy dose of Disney Channel-level romance and too much clunky shtick... made this feel qualitatively more like a middle-weight contender.",
            "It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once.",
            "This mischievous film never tires of teasing the conventions and traditions of the genre.",
            " Superhero fatigue is definitely a factor here, as the film can't shake the expected narrative beats of these sorts of movies with the third act a rote exercise of mass mayhem and close calls.",
            "Spider-Man: Far From Home continues the feels from Endgame, and there are definite callbacks to moments int he MCU that, if you're invested, will get you emotional. ",
            "Spider-Man: Far From Home is far from perfect (get what I did there), but relying on that overt Marvel confidence, it's a fitting epilogue to close out the series.",
            "This film has the best Spider-Man scene that has ever been filmed. It's not just visually stunning, but emotionally charged like no other. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "It would be wrong to write off Far From Home as a complete and utter failure, but it's certainly the most disappointing MCU film since Iron Man 2.",
            "eaps of fun, Spider-Man: Far From Home steps up the comic pace established by the Guardian of the Galaxy and Thor movies with bonus excruciating hormonal awkwardness, never more so than when Aunt May refers to his Spidey sense as \"Peter's tingle\".",
            "A joyous trek through Europe after the gloom of Thanos and Endgame is exactly what the doctor ordered.",
            "A totally enjoyable ride with a commendably creative premise. ... In the big picture, \"Far From Home\" is the second best \"Spider-Man 2,\" better than Electro in 2014 but behind Doc Ock in 2004.",
            "Consistently engaging thanks to its blend of humour, action and humanity.",
            "Breezy and light-hearted with some epic action pieces, it's a visual kaleidoscope that will send 'Peter Tingles' down your spine.",
            "A standard superhero movie, but introduces a few new elements I haven't seen in a Spider-Man film and would like to see explored more.",
            "One of the most entertaining films in the MCU, even more so than Homecoming, which almost didn't seem possible until now.",
            "It never abandons the sense of humor, fun characters, and wonderful chemistry between Tom Holland and Zendaya, as well as correctly balancing adventure, romance, and action. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Entertaining, goofy, and packed with strong action, \"Far From Home\" is a satisfying superhero adventure. ",
            "You could chalk it up to Marvel fatigue, but we should call it like it is: it's just not as good as Homecoming, and a lackluster endcap to the stellar phase 3.",
            "I didn't like it as a movie overall, but as an experience...",
            "Ultimately, Spider-Man: Far From Home is a fun, energetic, and entertaining blockbuster, and far better than what's been in cinemas these last two months.",
            "This is an easygoing summer-movie trifle, make no mistake, and yet... In years to come, this may seem very much a movie of its era."

            "Lords of Chaos is a badass fucking movie. It gives any newcomer to the topic an accurate depiction of how black metal started, the key characters on the scene, and what happened between Euronymous and Varg. It is a whirlwind of emotions...",
            "There's absolutely nothing interesting in the life of these satanic church burners... which can be summarized as a mix of chaos, prepotency, and idiocy.",
            "It's a great concept and is nicely shot but all too often feels like the product of some hipster committee meeting.",
            "That it succeeds as well as it does is largely due to Culkin, director of photography P\u00e4r M. Ekberg's striking visuals and its truth-is-stranger-than-fiction story about artists who prize image over all.",
            "The special tone of the film is one of his great achievements.",
            " Lords of Chaos proves a fascinating character clash/ study and fandom exploration that enhances the surface narrative. It also makes for twisted, gruesome quasi-factual account that bends boundaries, tests endurance and turns stomachs.",
            "As someone who had carved out a persona as a misanthrope, the film has a semblance of sympathy for a person who didn't really know how to deal with his feelings when it came to the suicide of his best friend.",
            "Lords Of Chaos will leave you shaken, torn to shreds and thoroughly headbanged-out thanks to Jonas \u00c5kerlund's torturous dedication to black-as-hell metal crimes. Decked in leather, soaked in damnation and ablaze with five-alarm intensity.",
            "A fascinating exploration of a unique time in metal's history, in addition to delivering a cautionary tale of leading a performative life.",
            "A not very honest adaptation (but hey, who knows?) that manages to tell a compelling story about a culture we definitely should know more about. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Lords of Chaos is, at times deeply, darkly funny. This takes nothing away from its very true to life horror.",
            " Rory Culkin is expressive and raw as movement frontman Euronymous, but it is Emory Cohen's Varg that keeps us up at night. His turn from babyfaced teen to full-blown arsonist is utterly disarming."

            "If the heart of the horror movie is the annihilating Other, the Other has never appeared with more vividness, teasing sympathy, and terror than in this 1932 film by Tod Browning.",

            "Freaks (1932) is a shocking, bizarre and unsettling horror film, but a durable cult favorite. Tod Browning directed the unusual, creepy, and gothic horror film with real-life side-show \"freaks\" - it was one of his best works...",

            "To the horror movie, a genre he helped create, he brought a taste for Victorian melodrama and an understanding, which he must have gained in the circus, for the isolated lives of weird and deformed outsiders.",

            "The film's stunning visuals of these and other impacted places, particularly the aerial shots, capture an abstract imagery that is at once beautiful and horrifying.",

            "An uneven but genial comedy that riffs on America's love of conspiracy theories.",
            "Trust can be a double-edged sword, according to Shelton and O'Brien. It must be earned as well as given. And without it, life can be as dull as the point of an antique sabre.",

            "Come to think of it, Ask Dr. Ruth isn't really a portrait or a deep dive of her legacy. It's two solid movies smushed together.",
            "As a film, Ask Dr. Ruth is a delight.",
            "The movie connects Westheimer's biography both to her philosophy toward sex and how she cultivated her famous persona.",
            "Will answer most of your questions about former Karola Ruth Siegel...through a spirited tour of much of what she has experienced and done during her long and remarkable life.",
            "It is a life worth recording and discovering, and the perfect subject for a documentary.",
            "Learning a little of her life is a fine way to spend 100 minutes of your own.",
            "...a lively look at a fascinating figure in American culture, whose life story has also played out in Germany and Israel.",
            "Watching diminutive sex therapist and media mega-star Dr Ruth Westheimer resist the valiant attempts by her daughters to admit she is a feminist is just one of the joys in this very entertaining insight into her remarkable life.",
            "Ask Dr. Ruth is instantly and continuously charming which is all down to Westheimer herself. A documentary that, above all, is an ode to this inspiring woman, a trailblazer and an activist who deserves this recognition.",
            "I so enjoyed this movie to my great surprise. I had forgotten just what an iconic and pivotal figure Dr. Ruth was in our national discussion of sexuality and relationships. ",
            "Ask Dr. Ruth doesn't reinvent the wheel or contain earth-shattering revelations, but it does a good job linking her harsh childhood with her drive to spread knowledge.",
            "America's favorite nonagenarian sex therapist, Dr. Ruth Westheimer, entertains and educates America in this delightful documentary.",
            "Docu about famous therapist has sex talk, cursing.",
            "For someone who was, for want of a better phrase, a Dr Ruth virgin, this documentary is the perfect introduction to an inspiring and brilliant woman who has lived the most fullest of lives",
            "Ask Dr. Ruth prioritises the admiration of an inspirational figure, rather than a probing of the mind that cared for so many. ",
            "...shows a side of the famous sex therapist you likely have never seen.",
            "[An] intimate story of a woman who continues to leave a mark on the psyche of American society. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "Ryan White's documentary isn't remarkable for its structure or artistry, but for its subject matter. Ask Dr. Ruth is as endearing as its subject and packs an uplifting message to boot."

            "Geek and hero make for a decent enough odd couple; geek and pigeon are often a hoot.",
            "\"Spies in Disguise\" is notable for its anti-violence stance but elsewhere operates like a hybrid of other animated movies you've seen, part \"The Incredibles,\" part \"The Secret Life of Pets,\" and 100 percent skippable.",
            "You could do worse with your family after opening holiday presents -- and it might even give you something to talk about with your relatives of varying political persuasions.",

            "'Spies In Disguise' is a great movie for the entire family. There are positive themes of embracing differences, taking ownership of idiosyncrasies, and showcases the benefits of not giving up. This film also shows kids that nerds and science are cool too!",
            "The most pleasing point of difference to this action-animation affair is a welcome anti-violence message underpinning its story of high-stakes international espionage.",
            "Pure, honest to god entertainment oozes out of every feel-good moment. Who knew Will Smith as a pigeon would be a winning formula?",

            "The film plays, in part, as a sort of James Bond knockoff - a conceit about as tired as can be - but it is neither sharp enough to be a satire nor exciting enough to work as an homage. ",
            "It's not nearly as fun or as entertaining as it should be ... It's serviceable, it's perfectly fine, and passes the time, but these days, your animation game needs to be better. ",

            "It's not a masterpiece, but it's far from being just a distraction or worse, a complete waste of time.",
            "Spies in Disguise has a lightness in its humor and a thoughtfulness in its discussion of how to solve problems, with a great voice acting turn from Will Smith. ",
            "While the spy stuff is fun, the heart of Spies lies in the relationship between Lance and Walter, specifically on how Lance grows from their friendship. ",
            "Reeks of cynical calculation.",
            "It's bright and breezy from start to finish, with an intelligent and humorous script, and engaging voice performances from Smith, Holland and Mendelsohn. ",
            "This is a perfectly enjoyable popcorn entertainment, a family-friendly time killer that will engage you while it's in front of you, then slip out of your mind completely until, three months later, you recognize the title on your streaming index."

            "Little Woods is a worthy entry in the Western genre effortlessly anchored by its two charismatic leading actresses.",
            "The performances from Tessa Thompson and Lily James convince me in this crime-slashed and neo-western drama that represents Nia DaCosta's directorial debut, even if the narrative is not as strong. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "[Tessa] Thompson's forceful, charismatic performance brings life to what could have been a relentlessly grim film, but it also unbalances the drama somewhat.",
            "This is a film of high tension about two sisters living on the edge of ruin in the farthest northern reaches of North Dakota. One slip up and they could end up homeless, or in jail. The only things they have to rely on are their wits and each other.",
            "A predictable narrative given rich contours...",
            "The film may not look impressive, but I am impressed by how [writer-director Nia] DaCosta introduces complications into this already complicated story without straining for effect.",
            "Though it may be on the nose at times, Little Woods is a tense and emotional look at the political issues we're arguing about today that are affecting people's lives.",
            "Little Woods acts as a slow-burning drama that too often extinguishes the tension just as things are heating up.",
            "Little Woods is a film that more people need to see, as it is not only a compelling survival drama, but it is a enlightening examination at a slice of Americana, an involving crime western and a touching look at a strong sisterly bond.",
            "Little Woods can be bleak, but it's a good choice if you're looking for some substance among the Hollywood blockbusters out this season.",
            "Writer-director Nia DaCosta's debut feature is a bravura and, at times, bleak look at women living on the poverty line in small-town America.",
            "Visually striking. Comparisons to Debra Granik's Winter's Bone and Leave No Trace are fitting...",
            "This small crime film focuses on big American problems. Thompson and James are terrific.",
            "DaCosta's feature debut is impressive and quite promising. Driven by a towering performance from one of today's great performers, Little Woods is a tense neo-Western/thriller.",
            "DaCosta's personal vision brings out shades of Kelly Reichardt and Debra Granik and refuses to exclude the possibility of dreaming, which is a positive factor.",
            "The strength of Little Woods lies with the actors, and their ability to inject life into characters that lead ordinary, rather squalid lives in a non-descript frontier town.",
            "It is a slow burning but effective film that shows great technique at times, particularly in its storytelling and performances.",
            "Like so many American stories, Little Woods is a drama about personal agency, but it's also a dramatisation of what it means, in material terms, to have very little agency to exercise."

            "Is at its strongest when focusing on the experiences of Judy's clients, and watching the emotional weight on their shoulders slide off as they open up to her.",
            "The early glimmers of something soulful and sobering - rooted in investigative details and detention center realities - ultimately give way to the tired mechanics of give-it-all uplift.",

            "While the viewer can intuit that Hanish has a strong clear story to tell, the director too often tricks things up with noncredible flashbacks, fatty getting-from-one-place-to-another montages scored to anthemic pop and other extraneous matter.",
            "The film, directed by Sean Hanish, sometimes turns didactic, but it benefits from the efforts of an exceptional cast; their work deserves to be seen.",

            "The caliber of the performances elevates the material to such a degree that the film is made compelling, and the struggle of both attorney and client is equal parts gripping and frustrating. ",
            "This one has a couple things extra going for it. First is the presence of Michelle Monaghan, a truly under-rated actress who somehow avoids turning her Judy into a do-gooder bore. ",
            "It's a little on the nose, but despite that it has moments and the story... is quite interesting on the merits. ",
            "Director Sean Hanish and writer Dmitry Portnoy both have their values in the right place. What they lack is an elegant dramatization of their ideas without a didactic subtext.",
            "Monaghan's performance as Wood is clear, strong, and real as she creates a younger yet experienced, but imperfect attorney fighting for what she knows is right. ",
            "While the film occasionally casts Wood in a little too rosy a glow to be quite believable, a lot of uplifted audience members will be ready to nominate her for sainthood as well.",
            "Finally a role worthy of Michelle Monaghan's talent. This is the movie you wanted \"On the Basis of Sex\" to be.",
            "This crowd-pleaser suffers from melodramatic embellishments and is too eager to inspire through courtroom histrionics, but at least it shines a worthwhile spotlight on a deserving subject.",
            "The movie could have been more powerful but has been turned into slick commercialism with its pop music soundtrack and rah-rah uplift.",
            "Saint Judy reminds us what America represents to the world. This timely and inspiring film instills faith in justice and human decency.",
            "The film follows formula but it's a compelling story and Monaghan's solid performance makes Wood a complex and relatable character.",
            "[W]hile its message is sincere, it's also a little too broad to make much of an impact.",
            "The film falls into the trap of needing to show tired problems at home, without ever making it add up to anything. That misstep holds back an otherwise solid story.",

            "...a meticulously crafted look at a trailblazer in his industry who burned out way to soon.",
            "For all the digging, Tcheng doesn't get all that close to Halston, who died in 1990.",

            "Much too long, Tcheng's latest documentary is thin on content despite having a fascinating structure. Fine, but forgettable and frustratingly disposable. Fast fashion as film.",

            "A provocative, important argument, but this is ultimately a confused film, trying to fuse several different stories-some of which would have made interesting stand-alone documentaries-into one worthy, but uneasy whole.",
            "Despite Everything's desire to distance itself from other climate change ventures, these early stories are perhaps the most conventionally structured for a documentary, and also the most engaging.",
            "Klein and those impassioned protesters provide something that has been in short supply in the predecessors - namely, a modicum of hope for the future.",
            "The evenly wrought film accessibly argues that runaway capitalism and short-term economic growth at all costs has caused an imminent catastrophe, and that global warming is the hot-foot instigator for a radical change in economic thinking.",
            "It distinguishes itself among similar planet-loving docs by showing evidence there is hope in what can often seem an overwhelming bleak task to begin repairs to an industrial-damaged world.",
            "If, as many seem to believe, we are presiding over the possible annihilation of our species, then maybe we need a kick in the pants more than a reassuring hug.",
            "Where An Inconvenient Truth was a resounding uppercut, This Changes Everything fails to land a single punch.",
            "Beware an ideologue in confessional mode. Whatever Klein's misgivings, they haven't prevented her partner Avi Lewis from recycling the genre's most hackneyed tropes. ",
            "At best, it is a pretty conventional documentary about climate change that offers up a few solutions (cooperative action, renewable energy).",
            "This Changes Everything is the rarest breed of activist documentary: one that doesn't preach.",
            "Riveting climate-change docu encourages grassroots action.",
            "Klein and husband/director Avi Lewis can't make a rhetorically strong enough case for the central idea... so they fire up the waterworks and hope you'll feel bad enough to let them have their way.",
            "By failing to address basic issues, This Changes Everything comes off as misleading at best, deliberately confusing at worst. ",
            "An unsettling but ultimately encouraging documentary about global warming and grassroots activism.",
            "This Changes Everything isn't a game-changer, but it is jarring enough to be scary.",
            "It's sometimes boring, it makes assumptions about its audience.",
            "All this material has a hard time coming together in a natural crescendo, and no amount of vibrating violin strings can give it the emotional urgency or focus it badly needs in the closing scenes.",
            "Klein is an excellent synthesizer of difficult ideas and knows how to make them accessible."

            "It's the joy of watching Chan, a Buster Keaton of kickboxing, hurling himself into every stunt with total commitment, astounding athleticism and oddly unflappable, shaggy-haired grace.",
            "Chan seems to do everything he can think of to ingratiate himself with viewers.",
            "One of the great 1980s action films. It's also one of the most 1980s action films.",
            "The likeable and graceful Chan directs, sings and performs jaw-dropping stunts. Few of his American or Austrian rivals attempt a fraction of that.",
            "In the course of the story, about drug traffickers, Mr. Chan gets three separate birthday cakes thrown into his face, and participates in several elaborately staged gun fights and car chases.",
            "Although the blend of whimsy and adventure swings more toward the former than the latter, Chan's signature stunt choreography is no less impressive.",
            "The humor and music didn't work for me but the action is unmatched",
            "If you enjoy action comedies, look no further than \"Police Story\", a film that highlights all the elements that made Jackie Chan an international superstar. ",
            "...a bona fide masterpiece of action cinema.",
            "As writer/director/star/stunt coordinator, Chan secured legend status right here before our very eyes with Police Story.",

            "Chan shows off his formidable physical agility and winsome personality.",
            "Arresting fight scenes well orchestrated. Whatever area the fights take place in, everything in the vicinity will be used to fight with; whether it's a shoe, two small steps, or a sock - Chan will find a way to use them creatively during the fight.",
            "In Police Story, Chan is able to highlight all of his gifts as an action star, a comedic star, and as a director balancing the two.",
            "...[shows] writer-director-star Jackie Chan in his finest fighting style -- along with his usual over mugging for the camera.",
            "[Chan's] impeccable sense for how to stage a sequence extends to simple conversations, and the films are built around what's possible in terms of action rather than filling in action to support the plot.",
            "Featuring cinema's best bus-related stunt sequence, a spectacular finale in a shopping mall and, um, multiple instances of its star getting hit in the face with cake.",
            "Just as good as the fights though are Police Story's comic set pieces, especially one totally unrelated to any kind of plot development, which finds Chan alone in the precinct office as everyone else goes to lunch.",
            "Algumas das gags (como a confus\u00e3o com os telefones) caem no vazio, mas as seq\u00fc\u00eancias de a\u00e7\u00e3o, como sempre esperamos de Chan, s\u00e3o formid\u00e1veis.",

            "With Tarantino apparently firm in his plans to make one more film after \"Hollywood\" and then retire from moviemaking, \"QT8\" is an entertaining and enthusiastic look back on where he's been.",

            "A good primer on one of our most important, innovative cinematic storytellers.",

            "Whether or not American Dharma is worth your time is ultimately up to you and whether you enjoy giving space in your life to controversial figures.",
            "As always, Morris burrows deep into his subjects. Here his laser focus gives Bannon free rein to reveal his guiding principles and strategies, admirable and otherwise, and Bannon serves up some stunning commentary.",

            "Where Klayman's film was anecdotal, letting Bannon hang himself with his arrogant disingenuousness, Morris' feels more intellectually rigorous - an interrogation that, by comparison, may not come across strongly enough to some as an indictment.",
            "It's the journalistic equivalent of Muhammad Ali's rope-a-dope strategy, and while Bannon is far too media-savvy to be one of Morris' best subjects, he doesn't clamp down tight, the way Rumsfeld did.",
            "In this times of intense ideological division, the film gives viewers on both sides of the aisle some points to ponder, if only they're willing to listen.",

            "Morris feels no need to paint Bannon as diabolical, not when the man is approvingly quoting Satan. Morris is merely taking after John Milton when he lets Bannon explain himself.",
            "A rather florid, disjointed conversation, one where Morris' attempts to challenge and confront Bannon feels mostly cathartic for the filmmaker, ultimately, without yielding much additional insight to understanding Bannon that hasn't already been said.",

            "In showing such a personal, unmeditated view of the global migration crisis through one family's story, \"Midnight Traveler\" is a timely, essential film.",
            "While the obstacles that face the Fizili family are daunting and, sometimes, heartbreaking and dangerous, the thing I got most out of this well-made and personal document is the stability and perseverance of the tiny family.",
            "What makes Midnight Traveler distinct from its counterparts is that it follows filmmaker Hassan Fazili's own family, and the intimacy he's able to capture over the life spans of three iPhones makes his documentary more tender and honest and immediate.",
            "This intimate documentary works on many levels... First and foremost, it illustrates the plight of the refugee during a global nationalism movement when even legal shelter can prove unsafe.",
            "The wide-reaching scope of the overseas refugee crisis is given a fresh cinematic perspective by this urgent and persuasive first-person documentary.",
            "It is the gift of \"Midnight Traveler\" to allow us to feel this family's fate in the pit of our stomachs. If the plight of refugees has ever seemed abstract, this film makes sure you know how real it is.",

            "ten years after Saint Laurent's death, a reedited version of the film has finally been released and it is a fascinating, if sometimes frustratingly impressionistic, fly-on-the-wall look at the last years leading up to presenting his last collection.",
            "Saint Laurent and Berg\u00e9 appear like exotic birds. In most shots, Meyrou's camera sits quietly in the corner. He allows his subjects to be plainly seen. Ironically, this unintrusive approach is what makes the film so intrusive. Everything is laid bare.",
            "Though a document of an ostensible celebration, Celebration is never celebratory, and maybe that's the point.",
            "[Olivier] Meyrou's film is a touching tribute to his genius and a bittersweet reflection on mortality.",

            "Unfocused but consistently engaging.",
            "Like democracy itself, the movie assumes such a broad mandate and has such noble intentions that indicating its shortcomings seems almost beside the point.",

            "Taylor's take on the topic is multi-layered, and one that if you don't pay close attention to, you might miss. But once defined, can democracy ever live up to its promise? That's something you'll need to watch What Is Democracy? in order to figure out.",
            "Taylor's film is an energetic one, styled as a typical issue picture, but willingness to open a dialogue that's refreshing and intellectually energizing.",
            "Astra Taylor's What Is Democracy? offers the art of thoughtful conversation as an antidote to the fraught political hysteria of the public sphere. ",
            "Vital, profound and eye-opening. It's far more provocative, fair and balanced than any films that Michael Moore and Dinesh D'Souza have ever made.",
            "Incisive.",
            "It's a fascinating and enlightening treatise.",
            "What is Democracy? is a call to arms, but it is also a powerful and piercing reminder that, as Plato said, \"nothing beautiful without struggle.\"",
            "One gets the sense that What is Democracy? might have been edited in a different form, one that clarified its purposes a bit more deliberately. ",
            "It's a bit on the slack side, with Taylor offering up one talking head after another, breaking up the sections with thoughtful quotes from Plato's Republic... But I'm not sure a slicker, sharper version of this would serve any purpose.",
            "What Is Democracy? reveals Taylor's sure instincts as she shapes the vast sprawl of often disparate, sometimes random-feeling material into a focused, thought-provoking essay that even leaves you feeling that there was so much more to say on the subject."

            "In the end, I'm not sure that What You Gonna Do When the World's on Fire? really \"says\" anything, and that's OK. Sometimes, the simple acts of looking and listening trump any attempts at eloquence.",

            "Meyrou's film offers a compelling snapshot of an artistic genius, switching from colour to black-and-white to contrast the growing distance between an iconic creator and the changing world around him.",
            "ten years after Saint Laurent's death, a reedited version of the film has finally been released and it is a fascinating, if sometimes frustratingly impressionistic, fly-on-the-wall look at the last years leading up to presenting his last collection.",
            "Saint Laurent and Berg\u00e9 appear like exotic birds. In most shots, Meyrou's camera sits quietly in the corner. He allows his subjects to be plainly seen. Ironically, this unintrusive approach is what makes the film so intrusive. Everything is laid bare.",
            "Though a document of an ostensible celebration, Celebration is never celebratory, and maybe that's the point.",
            "[Olivier] Meyrou's film is a touching tribute to his genius and a bittersweet reflection on mortality.",
            "The Last Collections feels as though it plucks a loose thread and the documentary itself becomes untied",
            "For casual observers, the film may ultimately prove to be a little too chilly and reserved for their tastes, but for those with a vested interest in the subject, \"Celebration\" should prove to be a cause for one.",
            "Saint Laurent was essential to 20th-century culture, and \"Celebration\" shows the inevitable fading of glory as well as the enduring features of his life's work.",
            "[Celebration is] a madcap collage of bits and pieces that somehow coalesce into something greater than the sum of its parts."

            "While it is generally engaging to learn about the influences of the screenwriter Dan O'Bannon or the artistic process of H.R. Giger (who designed the alien), the documentary is at its least fawning when it focuses on technique.",
            "It has a complex and rigorously argued set of theses that all come together at the end.",
            "\"Memory: The Origins of 'Alien,'\" a well-mounted peek behind the scenes of Ridley Scott's 1979 science-fiction masterpiece, is more interested in what you can see, as well as what you cannot unsee.",
            "The result often feels superficial; it is neither a definitive account of the creation of Scott's touchstone of horror and sci-fi, nor a cogent analysis of its aestheticized subtexts, those gritty and unnerving surfaces and the things lurking underneath.",
            "[O]nce the film finishes discussing said scene, it stops dead and dashes for the credits, as if Alien were a movie of one half only. Still, this is an appealing jaunt nonetheless - and a must for Alien enthusiasts.",
            "[A] solemn and enlivening documentary...",
            "It was an attractive work, in terms of the cinematography, editing, and graphic design. That can't be said about all making-of documentaries, especially those made by inexperienced or under-funded filmmakers. ",
            "There is the feeling that one can't escape; the feeling being that this plays a bit too much like a glorified DVD extra.",
            "Memory tasks itself with exploring in all the messy details exactly what makes Alien so special. It does so with incredible minuteness and style.",

            "The second half of \"Memory\" is solely focused on the infamous alien-creature-bursting-out-of-the-chest-of-Kane (John Hurt) scene. You, know, the one that we have all seen a zillion times over the years.",
            "... with that subtitle it is no surprise that a lot of the inspiration for \"Alien\" came from author Dan O'Bannon's childhood.",
            "Geeky but not too niche. Heavy but not over our heads. Choppy but never muddled. Appreciative and eager.",
            "Like the masterful film it considers, the weird, haunting, and fascinating Memory is alternately precise and oblique in the ways it conveys its ideas.",
            "Fascinating insight into not only the making of a masterpiece, but the inherent inspirations that trigger such bold creativity. ",
            "The film's chief purpose is to pull focus on the work of the late Dan O'Bannon (died 2009) who first dreamt up the idea.",
            "The Origins of Alien, dissects the journey from concept to conception in microscopic detail, and with abiding fondness for [Diane] O'Bannon's work.",
            "Plenty of the clips in Memory feature Ripley, but Weaver herself is MIA, and making an Alien documentary without Weaver is... well, it's about as good of an idea as making any other Alien movie without her.",

            "Taking such a granular approach to the work provides real detail to \"Alien,\" but also reveals some shortcomings.",
            "This much I can promise: after seeing this documentary you'll never look at Alien the same way again.",
            "... a treat for genre geeks and franchise aficionados, although the absence of Ridley Scott and Sigourney Weaver is a glaring omission.",
            "[I]t seems to forget that there's a whole lot of film remaining after the most famous scene."

            "Tim Sutton's artfully directed but self-important downer of a movie that's meant to be some sort of Grand Statement about life among dispossessed whites in rural, Midwestern America. ",
            "Anchored by a quartet of fierce performances, \"Donnybrook\" is an intense, visceral tone poem, a rumination on money and drugs and bloodshed as a means of making ends meet in the heartland of modern America.",
            "\"Donnybrook\" is a movie about, among other things, bare-knuckle fighting, but it's the viewers who will feel beaten down.",
            "A pointless exercise in gratuitous violence that imagines itself deep because it's got an opera-heavy score.",
            "Holy hell, \"Donnybrook\" is bleak. A movie about a down-on-his-luck former soldier and a vicious drug dealer competing for $100,000 in an underground bare-knuckle melee already sounds grim, but damn. ",
            "The gritty film is a no-holds-barred bare-knuckle battle royal through the most impoverished corner of contemporary America. It is not for the faint of heart.",
            "A repulsive story of drugs and street-fighting that wallows in violence more than suspense.",
            "Donnybrook has trouble finding its footing, coming off as derivative of superior films.",
            "The rural and sometimes riveting thriller implodes as predictability takes over. It resembles a film that would have been released by Golan-Globus under Cannon Films in the late 80s/early 90s.",

            "Unapologetically harsh with an abundance of visceral mayhem.",
            "There's plenty of sickening violence and shock factor tactics, but ultimately, this only diminishes the overall resonance of the film.",
            "Donnybrook isn't without its highlights - from its searing performance made even more impressive by their limited material to its gorgeous and grim cinematography - however, it simply feels bleak simply for the sake of bleakness.",
            "The downfall of the American dream observed through a hyper violent lens. A tale of brutality and sorrow that lacks an emotional punch. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Sutton presents this brutal tale as though it were the modern equivalent of a Greek tragedy...but it comes across instead like vicious, overblown pulp.",
            "This film is as bleak as it gets. There's nothing wrong with that, except Donnybrook never is able to develop an entry point. You're on board with its brutality or not.",
            "As an examination of primal aggression and toxic masculinity, this atmospheric drama packs a visceral punch. Yet as a broader glimpse at socioeconomic desperation in the Deep South, it's hardly a knockout.",
            "I couldn't get any of what I just saw out of my head for hours after I had viewed it.",
            "Without a solid script to support its darker themes, Donnybrook is simply a joyless exercise in toxic masculinity.",
            "The relentlessly bleak nature of Donnybrook will undoubtedly turn off a number of viewers as it's characters circle the drain of life.",
            "If we're to judge a movie by how well a director succeeds at accomplishing what he set out to accomplish, then Donnybrook is at best a demonstration of [Tim] Sutton's technical abilities.",
            "The best movies walk the line between having something compelling to say and just being exploitative. It swerves maniacally between those lines like a tweaker on a three-day bender, convinced that its characters have no other choice. "

            "As pop culture narratives go, \"Scandalous\" wants to be as colorful and fun as a flip through of the rag itself at the supermarket. But in these truth-challenged times, the jovial tone of \"Scandalous\" all too often outweighs the judgmental.",
            "It comes off as more of a puff piece than an expos\u00e9, with its gratingly upbeat score, comical editing and penchant for letting its round-up of former Enquirer employees off the hook.",
            "Landsman isn't merely cataloguing the history of a kooky tabloid; he's using the Enquirer as a launching pad to explore the collapse of the entire journalistic enterprise.",

            "I was appalled by a lot of the material in this [film] and thought \"If these are journalists, then I want a different title for my job\"... This is such a sleazy thing [the filmmakers] are uncovering. ",

            "A look at the infamous paper that emphasizes color over critique, it's a blazingly paced film that entertains and informs, even if many viewers who value journalism will groan as they watch."

            "Although repetitive at times and, like so many show business documentaries, displaying a tendency toward self-congratulation, the film will prove fascinating for dance buffs.",
            "As Wechsler allows rehearsal scenes to play out at length, the perfectionism of dancer-to-dancer lessons becomes improbably poignant.",
            "It's less of an insightful backstage documentary than a gushing, sycophantic love letter to the late Merce Cunningham.",
            "If the Dancer Dances is reminiscent of witnessing a philologist or literary translator at play, trying to get into the mindset of someone who works in a different language. ",
            "Director Maia Wechsler and her editor Mary Manhardt stayed on point with a difficult editing job to make this film hang together. It is almost too repititious...If you're not into dance particularly modern dance, this might not be for you.",
            "I found the film fascinating.",
            "Perhaps film can never really capture the essence of dance, but Wechsler does the next best thing and captures what it means to those involved in its creation. ",
            "Though not a perfect film, I'm glad it is in the world. It's a quality record covering new ground in the dance documentary genre. ",
            "If the Dancer Dances is obviously a must-see for any dancer, but even more than that, it's a good viewing experience for artists of any discipline. ",
            "A rare privilege - to have this level of access to the creation of new work which is attempting to honor the legacy of such a legendary choreographer. An important document of an artistic process.",
            "While the film doesn't always give us access to its present-day subjects, it still offers valuable insight into issues of artistic preservation.",

            "An itch to play a few too many of the greatest hits softens the impact of the ride. But make no mistake: \"Doctor Sleep\" shines.",
            "Part homage to Kubrick's moody atmospherics, and part hyper-literal superhero story, \"Doctor Sleep\" is stylish, engrossing, at times frustratingly illogical and, ultimately less than profoundly unsettling.",
            "From the opening shots and synth notes to a spectacularly chilling closing scene, Doctor Sleep makes a convincing case for its own greatness.",
            "Doctor Sleep serves as a thought provoking and logical progression diving into generational traumas and owning your gifts before it's too late. ",
            "Really slow but captivating at the same time.",

            "This is not a retread of a crazy man in a haunted house, but a well-paced drama about the traumas of childhood abuse, the remnants of the psychic energy all abuse holds. ",
            "Doctor Sleep is a film with a near-impossible brief and crushing audience expectations. It delivers on those conditions marvellously, and presents one of the smartest, most effective supernatural thrillers of its type in recent years.",
            "As a standalone horror film, Doctor Sleep is successful enough. The film is a tale of the supernatural, struggles with substance abuse and trying to overcome the damage of a crippling childhood. ",
            "It's a fascinating idea, taking from both Kubrick and King in order to make a composite of events and themes. Flanagan, however, just ends up with a contradiction.",

            "Shockingly good, rich with psychological depth, meaningful characters, an exquisitely modulated tone and a few moments of riveting terror.",
            "Doctor Sleep brilliantly bridges the disparities between both of King's source novels and Kubrick's adaptation.",
            "\"Doctor Sleep\" can be overwrought at times, and you feel the length in certain spots, but overall it's an effective, engrossing horror film that adds new texture, depth, and wrinkles to something you already love.",
            "Although \"Doctor Sleep\" doesn't quite reach the same height as \"The Shining\", this long-awaited sequel remains a decent entry.",
            "Moving, exciting, and often scary, Doctor Sleep is the sequel that The Shining deserves.",

            "It's steady and clear-headed, safe in the knowledge that truth is the ultimate humaniser. ",
            "It's good acting at its finest in this preaching to the choir \"right to life\" drama that might have worked had the filmmakers chosen to show the audience a little mercy by not constantly talking down to them.",
            "Jordan, however, is completely persuasive. The virtues possessed by Stevenson are all on the quiet side. His analytical flair is matched by his patience, his tenacity and his acuity. ",
            "Still, by the time you reach the end - and realise how closely the film-makers have stuck to the facts - you won't care. That the truth will out is entertainment enough.",
            "[I]t's never less than engrossing. Even with the schmaltz.",
            "Jordan... has steel and energy in his part, and... Foxx... gives a beautifully modulated, unflashy and quietly moving performance, easily his best in at least a decade.",
            " Jordan's subdued performance is intriguingly captivating, and Foxx finds humanity and hope within the confinement and ever-present cloud of death looming overhead.",
            "It's an accessible crowd pleaser with powerful drama and surprising levity and deserves a watch based on its inspirational telling of a fight for justice.",
            "It's a film that is impossible to ignore and absolutely should not be ignored.",
            "The film's power rests on the cast's remarkable performances. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            "Just Mercy may rely on formulaic structures and predictability to illustrate its point, especially in its highly charged final third, but it is hard to walk away from this film without being moved.",
            "It's more than just a courtroom drama, it is a very pertinent story that shoulders its responsibility with a steady hand and a focus that matches Brian Stevenson's idealism.",
            "Totally ignored by this year's Academy Awards after debuting to great acclaim at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival, this staggeringly good legal drama further fuels #OscarsSoWhite accusations.",
            "Cretton's Just Mercy is a moving film with committed performances. Johnny D's trial scenes are taut and emotional.",
            "Just Mercy doesn't preach to its audience. It simply shows us the irrefutable facts and allows us to draw our own inevitable conclusions.",
            "A superb and integral story about injustice and one man who tried to change it all. [Full review in Spanish].",
            "Not all good-for-you movies are actually all that good. Just Mercy, populated by monumental performances and powered by a story of uncommon courage, is by every measure a great film.",
            "Cretton's direction lacks the same level of compassion Barry Jenkins brought to If Beale Street Could Talk, or the same level of outrage Ava DuVernay brought to When They See Us. So, it fails to rise above a conventional courtroom drama.",
            "It's a great addition to a genre that stirs our emotions and calls us to action. ... It's also shocking, stating that for every nine executions in America, one death-row inmate has been proven innocent.",
            "For the most part it's well-acted, with topics and themes that are obviously hot-button issues right now...this is a time in history, and a particular man in his struggle for freedom...",
            "This is an important movie to watch right now as we talk about injustice, doing the right thing...",
            "Just Mercy captures Bryan Stevenson's story for posterity's sake. We shall never forget.",
            "The resulting movie is a very well assembled cinematic mediocrity.",
            "Simply told with limited theatrics and anchored by some weighty vulnerable performances, Just Mercy is an excellent watch."
