            "For all the sluggish script and the enormous weight of the special effects, this movie behemoth still has the power to shake us rigid and and touch the soul.",
            "[The ending] is a masterpiece of popcorn tragedy: not deep, not sophisticated, barely even credible, but gut-clutching for those of us who have already lost the sensible use of our stomachs, as we would in any worthwhile fairground ride. ",
            "The movie is a ride, and not without the odd moment of corniness. But it's also about freedom and flight, bondage and stagnation. And most fittingly, as a memorial itself, it's about memory and the act of remembering.",
            "No meager disaster movie, greased by generic formula and goosed by big-bucks technology... Titanic is one big, bruising movie that will appeal on different levels to different audiences. ",
            "Cameron's aim was to set the most intimate love story possible against one of the century's biggest tragedies, and he very nearly pulls it off. DiCaprio has a captivating presence in a role that might have been written for a young Clark Gable.",
            "Cameron has devised a tender love story between Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio that serves as the main focus of Titanic's storyline, and it works beautifully.",
            "Stirring music and seamless special effects add to the thrills - it's just a shame it takes so long to get to that point.",
            "It's the kind of movie that just doesn't come along that often.",
            "In recent years I've come around to thinking that a more nuanced version of the tale with better-rounded characters wouldn't resonate as powerfully as Cameron's shamelessly bold, sometimes silly strokes. ",
            "See Titanic, then, for its success as an outrageous visual stunt -- a marvel of cinematic (and computer) sleight-of-hand. But don't go with any illusions that this soap opera on water is anything but a cartoon melodrama with fairy-tale leads.",
            "Titanic has deservedly cemented its place as one of the greatest movies of all time, as it manages to capture the wretchedness of historical tragedy while also skilfully enrapturing us with the dedication shown by one person to another...",
            "The dialogue may be unspeakable, but the film remains unsinkable.",
            "What I can tell you, risking puns, is that it swept me off my feet almost from the get-go, a grand epic romance-disaster that reminded me, in the middle of my overstuffed-with-movies life, of what we mean when we talk about the power of cinema.",
            "Sure, 'Titanic' may be corny, clumsy, and obvious-but the sincerity of its emotions and the power of its spectacle endure.",
            "If computer-generated special effects have overpowered human-generated drama, Cameron seizes that dangerously cold technology and recasts it as dream and delirium, profoundly human in its sources and longings.",
            "The execution is state-of-the-art and breathtaking. Titanic offers the full compass of courage and cowardice, and it stands as an achievement that truly is a night to remember at the movies.",
            "Titanic provides an absorbing blend of historical fact and old-fashioned Hollywood tearjerking.",
            "Titanic is indeed a ship of dreams. Climb aboard and bon voyage.",
            "DiCaprio and Winslet both deliver star-making performances.",
            "Take one of history's most compelling tragedies, tell it through the lives of two engaging young lovers and show it with some of the best-ever special effects and you have a dazzling, exciting movie that is also poignant and personal.",
            "It's a technically magnificent and emotionally wrenching experience.",
            "Titanic is an awesome achievement, a traditional Hollywood epic that dazzles your eyes, breaks your heart and shivers your soul.",
            "DiCaprio manages a good mix of youthful bravado and nervous uncertainty... And Winslet shines as a willful rich girl who discovers her sensual side with this earthy urchin.",
            "With his beatific, sweet, open face, DiCaprio gives us a rooting interest in hoping that someone important to us survives the wreck."

            "When it was first released in 1997, it made quite a name for itself, arguably in large part to the fact of its subject matter. A decade later, the shock factor is gone and what's left is a genuinely funny little film.",
            "A crowd-pleasing blue-collar comedy, half funny and half sad.",

            "An intensely emotional drama that mixes elements of Southern Gothic with the kinds of characters and tensions that prevail in the plays of Southern writers like Tennessee Williams.",

            "'90s African American family drama has violence, language.",

            "More than anything, about the nature of memory and how it rarely matches the truth of life.",
            "The film is given an almost dream-like quality by Vincent who washes everything in a sepia-type tone that adds to the effect of seeing an adult world of deceit and hurt through the eyes of a child.",
            "Lemmons' focus on strong female characters, and her willingness to ignore accepted notions of \"black filmmaking\" are powerful assets, but one can't help wishing the film as a whole lived up to its initial promise.",
            "It feels like I've seen dozens of films this year by first time writers and directors, and not one has stuck to me until now.",

            "Pretentious as all hell, sorry.",

            "Gattaca doesn't quite live up to the promise of its premise.",
            "A thoughtful hybrid of sci-fi, thriller, and character drama; to give you some idea of its high-mindedness, it not only opens with a relevant Bible verse (Ecclesiastes 7:13), but in the opening credits that follow, Gore Vidal is fifth-billed.",
            "Among the very best of all the original \"thoughtful\" sci-fi movies out there.",
            "It predicts the way the world would change in 2001--and how our films would reflect that change.",

            "Peter Fonda delivers the performance of his career in this excellent indie hit.",
            "Deceptively old-fashioned, this is an emotionally quiet but rewarding portrait of a taciturn beekeeper (marvelously played by Peter Fonda, who resembles his dad) forced to emerged out of his solitary, sheltered life and face his family responsibilities",
            "Peter Fonda's portrayal of Florida beekeeper Ulee Jackson is a masterpiece of restraint, confident and finely etched, understated yet always in control.",

            "I think one of the things [Ang Lee] really specializes in is ensemble pieces like this one.",
            "What struck me about it was the fluidity and discipline of Lee's direction, the performances which captured so beautifully the confusion of that period of cultural and sexual evolution, and the compassion which I think is a feature of all of Lee's films.",

            "Beautifully nuanced, passionately performed, and terrifically realized piece of work.",

            "Woo, a master of poetical carnage, mixes kitsch, sadism, sentiment and comedy with choreographic precision.",
            "I won't pretend that I completely enjoyed it, but it certainly has a few elements that I've never seen before. Action aficionados will undoubtedly slobber all over themselves.",
            "[A] gorgeously shot, repetitively violent, occasionally repellent, sometimes silly and consistently trashy fantasy.",
            "For all its fiery explosions, Face/Off just kind of implodes.",
            "It's sick, slick and sensational.",
            "In Face/Off, Woo sweeps us away again, into a world of wild action, heroism, villainy and double faces that turn deadly.",
            "Although the narrative is hysterical in its implausibility, the action portion of the film is reasonably effective.",
            "Apart from enjoying the narrative hijinks, it's also fascinating to watch both actors interpret the demonstration of the respective transferences of character. ",
            "Everyone remembers Face/Off had awesome action and great performances but those weren't even the film's strongest asset. What makes Face/Off a profound film is how both Sean Archer and Castor Troy adapted to each other's lives.",
            "Face/Off is a giant step for a filmmaker known more for action sequences than psychological insight.",
            "An engaging and at times sophisticated story of identity and behavior, wearing the leering face of a farcical action cartoon.",
            "What really makes Face/Off tick, what sells the movie more than anything else, are the dazzling performances from the two leading men.",
            "Woo more than delivers in the overblown action stakes. It's also patently evident that both stars are having a ball sending up each other's mannerisms.",
            "Face/Off is a masterpiece equal to the action classics Seven Samurai, The Wild Bunch and The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.",
            "[Woo] benefits from the dual performances of John Travolta and Nicolas Cage, who alternately glower and boogie their way through creepy material that would have been far beyond the reach of lesser stars.",
            "The visuals are impossibly glossy and the sound impossibly loud. Every frame glistens with that antiseptic precision of advertising. Even the slightest emotional vibration is writ in 100-point type,",
            "A knockout new thriller by John Woo.",
            "Face/Off is a full-blooded, movie-going experience. It's 100 percent movie.",
            "Face/Off is the best action movie of the summer.",
            "Cage is good, Travolta is better. There is a glee to his performance, a sheer joy at playing two roles in one. He's having a rip-roaringly good time, and so are we.",
            "Almost indefensibly violent, the film is one of those whirligigs of wit, barbaric energy, blood spatters and firepower that will be adored by the morally retarded among us -- like me -- and loathed by the morally superior.",
            "This is the ultimate Woo movie, but while his fans will enjoy every minute, others will find it too long, repetitive, and violent.",
            "Face/Off makes bad movies look worse and makes the making of good movies look like the most thrilling work in the world.",
            "Though the plotting is preposterous, this is John Woo's most successful American movie, demonstrating his unique signature as auetur applied to a a blockbuster. "

            "It's not exactly 'Goodfellas.' But it's not every filmmaker who can create works as divergent as 'Goodfellas' and 'Kundun,' either.",
            "Vigorously directed, sensual and hypnotic, Scorsese's film is a visually extraordinary meditation on ritual, nature and humanity.",
            "A challenging, thought provoking, mediative film that sits uncomfortably with Scorcese's previous work is helped no end by a superb score by Philip Glass.",
            "Scorsese's rich tableau of image and music bears a potent emotional weight.",
            "Kundun is surely the most gentle and meditative of Scorsese's films, a placid biography with the scope of an epic, the quality of a storybook, and the dramatic stakes of a tragedy.",
            "There's no denying the artistry of Kundun. Its heart also appears to be in the right place. But for those like me who don't have a versed history in the modern history of Tibet or Buddhism, the scope is ultimately too big.",
            "Martin Scorcese has made a meditative, low key historical drama about a truly mystical figure of our modern history, departing from his usual, violence-prone flicks.",
            "Scorsese skillfully indulges his propensity for obsessive detail. Visually, the direction is varied and exhilarating",
            "Though a meditative, introspective film, Scorsese's distinctive techniques cause Kundun to pulse with life under its calm surface.",
            "All in all, Kundun is beautifully produced and honestly acted.",
            "Scorcese has made one of his best and most personal films.",
            "Kundun is original, moving, inspiring -- and one of the best movies of the year.",
            "'Filmed with the approval of the 14th Dalai Lama himself, Kundun is reverential to a fault...and that fault is the film's biggest weakness.'",
            "Kundun is both a stunning visual feast and a moving meditation on the difficulty of sustaining the Buddhist principle of nonviolence in a brutal world.",
            "Scorsese's celebrated eye for composition and camera placement has never been more evident."

            "An engaging look at a mangy day in the lives of two junkies trying to kick, Gridlock'd would have been a good mid-level B.O. performer even without the interest surrounding it, due to the recent death of co-star Tupac Shakur.",
            "The &#64257;lm has a fairly uninteresting narrative motor in its thriller subplot, but hits on an edgy black comic tone for Stretch and Spoon's increasingly pained dealings with the unsympathetic representatives of authority.",
            "The film seems so fresh it's almost possible to forget that it is a fraud in its description of the culture of hard drugs.",
            "The movie's appeal lies largely in its capacity for surprise, riffing off tired characters and pooped genres to produce, intermittently at least, a fresh new tone. Call it junkie humour.",
            "Cast against type as the gentler of two musician junkies trying to burrow through the bureaucracy to enter a rehab clinic in Detroit, Shakur has the relaxed screen presence of a young Wesley Snipes and plays perfectly off the delirious Tim Roth.",
            "This is grim material, but surprisingly entertaining, and it is more cause to mourn the recent death of Shakur, who gives his best performance as Spoon, a musician who wants to get off drugs.",
            "Hall shows taste and humor as a filmmaker, and he is fortunate to have three leads who bring quirkiness and style to his film. ",
            "A dark, effective satire about drug addiction that offers laughs as well as savage criticism of the US approach to dealing with users.",
            "While not entirely successful, there's enough humor and humanism amid gritty urban locations to recommend Gridlock'd.",
            "The late Shakur is especially impressive as the brighter of the duo -- a frazzled but infinitely patient character with a touching faith that somehow, if the pair just keeps plugging away, everything will turn out okay.",
            "An ambitious, too ambitious, effort by Curtis Hall that shows talent and a future behind the camera.",
            "A very underrated film that is also very truthful",
            "Written and directed by actor Vondie Curtis Hall, the film blends savvy and sour-mash humor with bone-deep sadness that recalls predecessors as varied as After Hours and Trainspotting.",
            "Exposes the obstacles that that two down-and-out men face in their efforts to turn their lives around.",
            "So just when Roth and Shakur's clowning closeness nearly transcends the subject, the film throws up a bunch of flashy edits and MTV-esque close-ups that trivialize it. Junkies just can't win.",

            "When will someone realize that sexy Sarah Jessica Parker is pure comic gold and start writing movies that give her a chance to glisten? She's the only spice in this too-sweet romantic comedy.",
            "Alas, first-time director Scott Winant and screenwriter Winnie Holzman rarely get beyond the cuteness of the story's structure.",
            "I was not surprised to discover in the press notes that the movie ''has a touch of autobiography.'' The film's irritating insistence on parading its sensitivity gave the game away.",
            "With its clotted script, art direction that's all splash and no style, and dialogue that's too nakedly calculated to facilitate identification), this tedious and confused movie points several characters in obvious directions.",
            "Very little is amusing in all of this; the lighting is murky, the sound is mumbly, and will someone please tell the piano player to knock it off?",
            "Its stars, young, sexy performers all, deserve a better vehicle.",
            "The woeful miscasting of Jeanne Tripplehorn sabotages this romantic comedy about two people who are destined to meet but who contrive to keep missing each other.",
            "Coincidence follows coincidence as the story moves predictably toward its pre-determined ending. But not before Winant and Holzman parade an annoying array of thinly drawn eccentrics and weirdos across the screen by way of fleshing things out.",
            "Sometimes funny but often plodding.",
            "'Til There Was You is a rarity -- a film in which absolutely nothing works. Nothing. Not one redeeming performance. Not one convincing moment. Not one solid laugh.",
            "Bad romantic comedies with sappy characters aren't always without merit, since we cynics can at least use them to further our conviction that love isn't worth the trouble. But this bad romantic comedy is merely bad.",
            "Graceless star Tripplehorn -- who's called upon to execute a painful series of pratfalls in a high-tech restaurant -- is not a natural comedian, and overall the movie is awkward and leaden.",
            "A tired piece of romantic cornball fare that harks back to a bygone era, the film is a badly conceived, poorly executed fairy tale guaranteed to make audiences squirm in their seats.",
            "The film's real irony is that Gwen and Nick are so annoying that they deserve each other.",
            "The end credits couldn't have come any sooner",
            "This is a fluffy, delightful romantic comedy in the same vein as Sleepless in Seattle.",
            "Tripplehorn and McDermott are likable enough in their roles, but Holzman's precious, overwritten script gives them few genuinely honest moments.",
            "Bending the destinies of its principals like so many pipe cleaners, 'Til There Was You dwells mechanically on the mysteries of fate."

            "Good Will Hunting is lyrically directed, efficiently written, side-splittingly funny, quietly devastating.",
            "The headline story from this slice of honestly earned sentiment is Matt Damon, who delivers the year's No. 1 breakthrough performance directly atop his agreeable high-profile turn in John Grisham's The Rainmaker.",
            "The best thing about Good Will Hunting is not in its well-crafted, psychological symmetries but in the just-plain messiness of its humanity. It's rowdy, it's funny, it's heartbreaking -- it rings of life.",
            "A crowd-pleaser, with bags of charm to spare.",
            "Towering performance by Matt Damon as a troubled working class who needs to address his creative genius elevates this drama way above its therapeutic approach, resulting in a zeitgeist film that may touch chord with young viewers the way The Graduate did",
            "The film works as a character-driven narrative because Mr. Van Sant and his co-screenwriters are not afraid to unlock the psychological mysteries of their five major characters with clear and concise dialogue.",
            "What Matt Damon and Ben Affleck accomplish with such a profound, witty, inspirational and heartbreaking script is quite extraordinary. And then, Mr. Robin Williams takes it to another level. [Full review in Spanish]",
            "The acting is outstanding; Williams and Damon perfectly embody their roles, creating a believable, poignant, powerful partnership full of uplifting, feel-good triumphs.",
            "On the surface there doesn't seem to be too much going on, but dig a little deeper and you'll find remarkably telling insights into the mind games that go with being a genius.",
            "The film offers Robin Williams the chance to show his dramatic acting skills.",
            "The movie... [is] surprisingly moving, though resolutely unsentimental, rites-of-passage yarn.",
            "It's a deceptively good performance by Williams: the schmaltzy raw materials of Maguire would seem to be a trap, but he plays it absolutely straight, in muted, dignified tones",
            "It's a movie that captures (in a way that perhaps an older screenwriter could not convey) the limitless possibilities of youth, a movie in which a character can tell another, without cynicism, \"You could do anything you want. You are bound by nothing.\"",
            "Most movies about troubled individuals are insulting in the way in which they suddenly wrap things up with insipid developments that cause tumultuous, positive transformations in the protagonist; this film avoids that pitfall.",
            "Despite its coarse exterior, Good Will Hunting proves to be a rather positive and motivational experience.",
            "Can get overly sentimental at times, but Gus Van Sant's sensitive direction... and his excellent use of the city make it a hugely entertaining and effective film.",
            "It's acted and directed with care, and Damon is outstanding, his scenes with Driver being especially sparky.",
            "The film succeeds not because of an overall arc, but as a chain of smaller moments that glimmer in their minuscule perfection.",
            "For the first time in his career, Van Sant is invisible as a filmmaker, simply getting out of the way of the story and his performers. The film is richer for it.",
            "Affleck is on my long list for Academy notice this year.",
            "... beneath their arrogance and crass behavior, you'll find a lot of hurt and many defense mechanisms raised against a compassionless, manipulative society.",

            "The songs (co-written by Guest and Tapster Harry Shearer) are suitably ridiculous and the deadpan gags come thick, fast and too numerous to mention, all delivered with knuckle-gnawing subtlety by the C-list cast with A-list style.",

            "Trabalhando em um subg\u00eanero que praticamente ajudou a crier (o do pseudocument\u00e1rio), Guest cria mais um filme que diverte por compreender t\u00e3o bem seu tema e seus personagens.",
            "A sly, gleeful and subtle comedy that pokes fun at American musicals, amateur theatricals, and the culture of celebrity-the universal wish to be famous--set in the small, provincial town of Blaine about to celebrate its 150th anniversary.",
            "It's Corky's movie.",
            "Guest's satire of small-town America and amateur actors has a sly edge, it's not mean, and Guest never strips his characters of their dignity.",

            "It's silly, but it's also free from pretensions to be anything else.",

            "Mega-budget action extravaganzas don't get much sillier than this.",

            "It's not exactly a spoof of action flicks, but everyone involved clearly has tongue wedged firmly within cheek.",
            "Rude, crude, mindless action and nonstop gratuitous violence just don't get any better.",
            "Bruckheimer may be the only producer working in Hollywood today who deserves the auteur treatment.",
            "Director Simon West pulls off the impossible task of having the film make constant fun of itself and its viewers while keeping the storyline grounded enough for emotional payoffs.",
            "This is a big, silly film. Is it full of explosions and one-liners? Of course. Is it entertaining? Of course.",

            "With West's confident competence, and Bruckheimer's reliable slickness, Con Air gets out of its own way and becomes a trash classic.",
            "Jerry Bruckheimer should be thankful for the modern audience's short attention span.",
            "I don't know how it happened, or what Simon West was thinking, but the first half of Con Air is brilliant and the second half is a non-stop climax, and a dimwitted one at that."

            "In The Pillow Book, text and texture meet so exquisitely. Sex is a visual art, Greenaway says, and writing is a matter of life and death.",
            "It is exciting that in an age of mass book signings and disrespect for literature, Greenaway is able to sexualize the author's signature as it sweeps up a woman's neck.",
            "The Pillow Book is an experiment in the potential of film. It rejects convention and asks the viewer to forget traditions and entrenched assumptions. Those willing to go along will be hypnotized.",
            "Greenaway is a dedicated aesthete and sensualist who creates his own little worlds of cruelty, delight and artistic trickery. With tremendous brio and skill, he cuts his patterns into our minds, tickling our skins with his brush.",
            "I can, with many reservations, recommend The Pillow Book for graphic artists and, of course, for Star Wars completists. People who simply can't get enough nudity might also want to take a look.",
            "As intricately assembled as all of Greenaway's works, and representing one of the last films from famed DoP Sacha Vierney, The Pillow Book is worthy of a revisit, easily existing within its own timeless universe. ",
            "Greenaway provides a visual feast, then he kills your appetite.",
            "Seductive eye candy masquerading as thought-provoking art cinema.",
            "Pillow Book may be a dull, heartless, cruel film, but for what it's worth, it looks marvelous.",
            "The Pillow Book is erotica for bookworms. Its poetic story is told brush stroke by brush stroke, in calligraphy painted on naked bodies and in the \"pillow book\" or diary of Nagiko (Vivian Wu).",
            "Extraordinary. Ravishing. Preposterous.",
            "A surprisingly humane, satisfying film.",
            "A lavish, sensual and endlessly fascinating film that almost fetishes fetishism, this is provocative in every sense.",
            "The Pillow Book is obsessed with obsessive erotic obsessiveness. If you've ever trembled at the thought of having Japanese characters painted on your nude body, this is the film for you. Bring a lunch; it feels like it'll never end.",
            "Greenaway is a unique filmmaker in that he layers images upon one another in a single frame and doesn't require dialogue to make his films arresting.",
            "At first daunting but ultimately awesomely impressive and beautiful.",
            "A very intimate, sensual film, and a torrid, lurid melodrama, full of passion, jealousy, hatred and revenge.",
            "Yawn.",
            "Never less than mesmerizing, even when you're not exactly sure what exactly Greenaway is trying to say.",
            "A seductive and elegant story that combines a millennium of Japanese art and fetishes with the story of a neurotic modern woman who tells a lover: \"Treat me like the pages of a book.\""

            "The rest of the film is Sheen, playing a George Stephanopoulos-styled presidential adviser, being chased around Washington D.C. by an assassin who is a terrible shot and has no speaking lines.",

            "Although it's \"just a movie\" and \"all in good fun,\" there's something kind of not fun about a film that opens with a sweet little girl being eaten alive by a flock of pigeon sized dinosaurs. (Parent alert: The film's PG 13 rating is a joke.)",
            "Taking the funniest character from the first film and handing the reins over to him was a pretty brazen move that paid off in more ways than one.",

            "Clearly, it wishes to be different, but anyone who fondly recalls the buddy films of the '70s will find it to be more of the same.",
            "The quirky-misfits-on-the-road genre is nothing new or revolutionary, but the film possesses a naive charm that is as refreshing as it is rare.",
            "As the film progresses, however, it begins to accumulate all sorts of unnecessary characters and subplots that only serve to weigh it down.",
            "A harangue on how ironic it is that men often attack one another verbally and physically as a way to get close.",

            "Parts of the movie focusing on drugs and wanderlust seem like throwbacks to the '60s, but most of the story is more self-indulgent than sociological.",
            "Not a great picture -- not by a long shot -- but the many and various parts of Finn Taylor's quirky black comedy do add up to something rather appealing.",
            "Nothing here is sufficiently wild.",

            "A promising first film with moments exceeding that promise.",
            "Broken English surprised me all around: I didn't expect to be particularly impressed with it, and instead it turns out to be not only one of my favorite films I've see this year, but it will probably earn a spot in the all-time annals for me.",
            "Posey's admirers will experience a sensual intoxication that fans always experience when their film goddesses are at their very best.",
            "This isn't the best independent film we've seen starring Miss Posey, but she is the reason this one works.",
            "a tired retread of Sex and the City, with all the same preoccupations and issues but with none of the fun",
            "Edgy girl-meets-boy indie for older teens and up.",
            "When Nora decides to take yet another risk against her better judgment, the film leaves to you to judge it as quixotic, vexing, or fitting.",
            "You might be a little surprised or at least amused when the caustic, tired, joyous, frantic roller coaster stops.",
            "Ultimately, the only wisdom you leave with is the implausibly wise pocket philosophy gleaned from romantic strangers on the streets of an idealized France.",

            "Posey gives a committed performance, and Justin Theroux is good as an overindulged movie star. But almost nothing that's said or done here is convincing. And the energy is set at near-coma level.",
            "Zoe Cassavetes' new film Broken English is a delight, and as a debut film shows that we can expect good things from her.",
            "It's pretty clear where this is going from the first frame, though Posey's performance does keep you interested.",
            "[Cassavetes] treats cliches as fodder for comedy and nuances as the mainstays of a deeper, more beguiling sexual humor. What's engaging about this movie is that all the conventional trysts become low-key nightmare farce.",
            "Her Nora is a complicated mess you can't help but fall in love with even as she manages to tear herself apart, and watching Posey slowly bring this frazzled female to love's doorstep is absolutely joyous.",
            "Parker Posey is one of those rare performers who can elevate a mediocre film into a good one and a good one into a great one simply by the sheer force of her personality."

            "An exhilarating film that happens to be about moviemaking itself, Olivier Assayas's sinuous, kinetic, waggish Irma Vep is an oblique, supremely enjoyable course in movie history.",
            "If you're going to poke fun at the film industry, you might as well go for broke.",
            "Though Irma Vep may be best appreciated by movieheads, it's hardly just an homage. By its shrieking avant-garde climax, it's more like a statement on how history, even filmed history, can fragment and dissolve into oblivion.",
            "Irma Vep is undeniably a complex and thought provoking work - but compared to the comparatively human films Assayas has made recently, it can't help but feel less rewarding as a result.",
            "Light, playful, and self-reflexive, Assayas' film is a mi or work but it's enjoyable and boasts a graceful performance from Maggie Cheung.",
            "The post-modern compulsions on display here may bring movies together, but they also keep people apart.",
            "A wonderful tribute to filmmaking that could only be made in France, it has delightful performances and a low-budget style -- like the film it parodies -- which work beautifully.",

            "One of the few movies about making movies that captures the kinetic madness of the process. Maggie Cheung, playing herself, floats like a bemused Buddha through the maelstrom, offering a welcome sense of grace and normalcy.",
            "Love of film is the magical point of the film."

            "The franchise has lost none of its taste for acid-spewing, flesh-impaling, entrail-dripping gore. But the tone has changed...If this is your cup of slime, this jauntily gruesome installment won't disappoint.",
            "Weaver obviously knows her role by now, but Winona Ryder is as much of an action hero as Julie Nixon would be, going way out of her element.",
            "It satisfactorily recycles the great surprises that made the first movie so powerful. And most significantly, it makes a big hoot of the whole business.",
            "It brings a mordant, crackerjack wit to the world of chest-busting, head-ripping creepazoids from beyond.",
            "If you need to read a review to decide if you want to see \"Alien Resurrection,\" you absolutely shouldn't be going.",
            "Huge contrivances, surprises that are stupider than they are unexpected, and stale dialogue work against the only redeeming factor: the visuals.",
            "The best way to enjoy this so-so effort is to treat the whole shebang like a football match where everybody already knows the result. Cheer on the dumb humans, boo the even dumber aliens.",
            "The team chose to raise the franchise from the ashes, but instead of a golden phoenix they produced a jaundiced turkey.",
            "Jeunet,... has both a pictorial imagination and a healthy sense of irony, qualities that may not have viewers on the edge of their seats but do tend to make \"Resurrectoin\" quirky fun.",
            "It's tense, mordantly funny, very graphic and bloody, while Weaver is on great form as the clone with some interesting alien influences on her personality.",
            "It's at least more watchable than Alien3 in that it knows it's a bit crap but has a blast with it anyway! I have to admire that, even if it still won't score that highly...",
            "Without anything to pull the project in a single direction, it fumbles and flails, punctuated by some interesting visuals and action beats, but content to coast on the calm seas of been-there, done-that.",
            "If you prefer the action of Aliens, then Alien: Resurrection has the next best action of the franchise. If you prefer the horror of Alien, Alien: Resurrection is the second scariest one.",
            "This is not a Hollywood space thriller at all, but an intergalactic fantasy driven by the same cheerfully eccentric impulses that have informed a myriad of high-spirited French filmmakers.",
            "A blend of surrealist humor, unintentional self-parody and groan-inducing moments, this is easily the nadir of the franchise.",
            "[Jeuenet] doesn't push it all the way to \"so bad it's good\" territory, but he at least gives a healthy dose of the bizarre that makes it memorable, in its fashion.",
            "This fourth chapter in the popular sci-fi-horror franchise is without a doubt the weakest, both dramatically and visually.",
            "More than worthwhile as a closing statement.",

            "After the disappointing Alien 3, this fourth film in the franchise represents a marked improvement, but it fails to match the level established in the first two films."

            "The big part of Lee's film commemorates the lives of the '4 little girls' who died, through the memories of parents, siblings and friends.",
            "It is Lee's job as a film maker to imbue these images with life, and that's a task he easily accomplishes.",
            "There is mostly sadness and regret at the surface in 4 Little Girls, but there is anger in the depths, as there should be.",
            "4 Little Girls is a masterpiece that needs to be seen and remembered.",

            "It's presented with Lee's usual intelligence and clarity as he skilfully mixes politics with moving reminders of the lives it affects.",
            "Time and tragedy may have flattened the four girls into remote paragons of youthful virtue, but the viciousness of anti-integrationist rhetoric is palpable and should never be forgotten.",
            "Lee's filmmaking ... has the beauty of simplicity and the shadings of compassion.",
            "Spike Lee's Oscar-nominated documentary, about one of the defining moments of the civil rights movement, balances personal and painful memories of many witnesses with a poignantly political expose of the event, the murder of four innocent girls.",
            "Some of the credit for the two convictions may well be due to Spike Lee's memorable 1997 documentary...which brought new attention to the case.",
            "Immensely gripping in its outrage and poignancy. Nobody knows how to bring the disdain of racial to the forefront like the skilled Spike Lee",

            "A thoughtful, graceful, quietly devastating account.",

            "There's something intrinsically insincere about the whole quest. Gray is on a search less for a cure than for material.",

            "Becomes a kind of strange examination of human existence; frail, idiosyncratic, and ultimately a kind of cosmic joke.",
            " It is haunting, though. How could it not be, when the last lines of the monolog are \"Ecstasy, despair, ecstasy, despair\" and some mention of a big fish?",
            "Soderbergh does (Gray) no favors with a series of overwrought stylistic choices.",
            "Visually inventive version of Gray's monologue, though the material is not as interesting as that of Swimming to Cambodia.",
            "The late Spalding Gray's monologue is typically fascinating, and Soderbergh's creative staging is a treat.",
            "Gray's Anatomy is a triumphant reminder of the power of words to summon our deepest fears.",
            "Using every cinematic trick in the book, [director] Soderbergh turns Gray's one-man world into the most surreal mind-expander since Alice fell down the rabbit hole.",
            "Not only is it interesting to follow the course of Gray's storyline, the movie is also equally interesting to view, even if the storyteller is just sitting in front of a desk most of the time.",
            "The film manages to come off like a dinnertime conversation with a friend -- albeit a one-sided and long but very good and very funny one.",
            "In spite of Soderbergh and the painful lack of an audience/laugh track, Gray's story is immediately compelling, proving that once again, a talking head can truly entertain an audience.",
            "If you cannot see Spalding Gray live, then do see his monologue films. Gray's Anatomy can be infuriating, but Spalding makes it worthwhile.",
            "The movie version of Gray's material seems arch, contrived and starchy, not the spontaneous eruption that his theater work manages to resemble.",
            "Soderbergh is a gifted director (SEX, LIES AND VIDEOTAPE; KING OF THE HILL); Gray is a gifted monologist (SWIMMING TO CAMBODIA). They're just not a very good match for the creation of a film."

            "Men In Black deserves credit for supplementing its special effects with a breezy script and genuinely charismatic performances by Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones.",
            "Its attitude is poised somewhere between the deadpan ghoulishness of the Coen brothers and a Letterman-like sense of the absurdity of life in New York's rich ethnic stew.",
            "Men in Black is moderately amusing, well-constructed and mercifully short, but it fails to deliver on the zaniness of its first half.",
            "There's a playfulness, here, that you don't often find in a special-effect flick.",

            "Men in Black is the rare breed of a sci-fi blockbuster that film audiences don't really get the opportunity to see anymore in theaters.",
            "[Director Barry Sonnenfeld] establishes the premise in the wildly entertaining first 45 minutes and then glides along for the rest of the film on the strength of a poker-faced comic sensibility.",
            "What makes this wildly imaginative setup so much fun is the contrast between the deadpan gruffness of Jones and Torn, and the spectacularly strange environment in which they work.",
            "Men in Black, running a breezy 98 minutes, is a showpiece of laconic economy. It's quick, eccentric and deadly funny and for many young movie-goers it's likely to be a close encounter they'll want to see a second and third time.",
            "A lean, punchy, fast paced, and extremely endearing sci-fi action comedy.",
            "Great special effects, inventive alien designs and Smith and Jones's hip, hilarious double act make director Barry Sonnenfeld's Lethal Weapon-style buddy picture a fast-paced pleasure.",
            "The plot, trifling as it is, doesn't much matter. What makes the movie such a hoot are the clever gags, imaginative special effects, and the snappy byplay between the well-matched Jones and Smith.",

            "There are so many things to enjoy here. Director Curtis Hanson... keeps a complex story coherent and absorbing -- if bloody at the end.",
            "At the center of the movie are three mismatched cops with separately fueled ambitions, ferociously played by Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce. Their combined charisma almost smashes through the screen.",
            "L.A. Confidential isn't quite up there with Chinatown, but it's the closest thing to come down the Santa Monica Freeway in the last 23 years.",
            "Hanson has made the film noir setting virtually another starring character.",
            "Spicy and boiling-hot, this sensational early-'50s crime drama is a morality play disguised as pulp fiction -- a sprawling saga of corruption and redemption set against a flashy West Coast backdrop.",
            "A simply stunning score by Jerry Goldsmith accents every nail-biting scene, enhancing the tension and suspense that snowball as motives are unearthed.",
            "L.A. Confidential could yet prove too demanding for big audiences, but there are huge narrative pleasures and swoony surprises that lift the picture off in new, darker directions. This may be the best noir storytelling since Chinatown. ",
            "Its hard edge and mystery, set beneath the bright lights of Tinseltown, makes for a rewarding cinematic experience that does not disappoint with each repeated viewing.",
            "Jerry Goldsmith's work for 'L.A. Confidential 'is a compendium of the talent that this master had accumulated during his four decades of career. [Full Review in Spanish]",
            " What makes LA Confidential such a perfect film of the Nineties is not that the legend takes over from the fact, since that's almost invariably the case, but that the legend is so knowingly, so unanxiously embraced -- as legend.",
            "A sublimely complex story.",
            "Hanson delivers something ever rarer in film culture, not a new film noir but an old-fashioned total movie, somehow of a single piece.",
            "The story is so complicated that the movie can't quite make it clear, but the picture has impressive energy and high-intensity performances from Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, and Guy Pearce.",
            "Like Chinatown before it, this twisted and twisting tale of cops, crime, corruption and hangers-on in 1950s Los Angeles artfully evokes the flip side of the City of Dreams.",
            "While not reaching the twisted heights of the superbly sinister Chinatown, L.A. Confidential is smart, complex and engrossing.",
            "It doesn't let up for a second, cramming James Ellroy's sprawling novel into a mere 98 minutes. That's both good and bad. The good? It's an exhilarating, breakneck ride. The bad? It's over far too soon.",
            "L.A. Confidential is a satisfyingly plotted film with echoes of the 1974 classic Chinatown.",
            "The result is a powerful work of art. Seldom has a study of sleaze said more about what makes us all tick.",
            "This superlative filming of James Ellroy's complex 1950s detective story by director Curtis Hanson fuses period authenticity, fluid direction and searing, full-blooded performances.",
            "This may be the best movie of the year; it's definitely one of the greatest crime films of all time.",
            "Though their spirits may seem all but entombed by sin, these men are vividly human, this film savagely alive.",
            "The genius of the film -- and it is a film of genius, without a doubt -- is that it holds an investigation into the human soul's capacity for evil, while somehow still managing to be funny, thrilling, lively, shocking and unremittingly entertaining.",
            "A glamorous, alluring entertainment that revels in the artifice of Hollywood while exposing its corrupt heart, L.A. Confidential pays stylish homage to some of the great film noirs of the distant and recent past."

            "A cheesy and sometimes melodramatic slasher film that is certainly not one of the best, but... It's directed better than a lot of the slasher films in recent years.",
            "The numerous false alarms, jump scares, frustratingly disbelieving supporting personas, and misdirections are admittedly amusing.",
            "For all its glaring flaws, I Know What You Did Last Summer has its fun with a loosely adapted story from the novel of the same name by Lois Duncan.",
            "The performances by the young actors are engaging.",
            "All the scary, screaming, sniggering fun continues here, aided by swell performances from Hewitt and Gellar in particular... an appearance from the always groovy Anne Heche, and the crisp, crackerjack direction of Jim Gillespie.",

            "It's tempting to think Pacino stopped trying sometime in the mid-1980s. But watch Lefty's elegiac final scene and you might conclude that it's not Al's ability that's dimmed, rather it's the imagination of casting directors that's grown stale.",

            "Absolute Power is one of those evil-in-high-places thrillers that hums along nicely while the crimes are being committed, and sputters while they're being solved.",
            "It's more effective than expected - aside from the scenes of excessive sex and violence, that is - mainly because Eastwood gives one of the most deeply felt performances of his career.",
            "It's let down by a wildly implausible script... but it's still enjoyable, and the sleaze theme is nothing if not timely.",
            "Eastwood has infused Absolute Power with a predictably deliberate sensibility that fits the material quite well...",
            "A reasonably engrossing and entertaining suspenser for most of its running time that is undercut by too many coincidences and some whoppingly far-fetched developments in the home stretch.",

            "Frequently fun, but glossy tosh.",
            "The plot is a doomsday version of Bill Clinton's Paula Jones problem, but the theme is impending mortality--settling scores before time's up.",

            "Not one of Clint's best, but still better-than-average entertainment.",
            "Contrived and dawdling.",
            "Doesn't rank with Eastwood's best work as actor/director, but it's nevertheless solidly enjoyable.",
            "A pretty decent suspense movie, until its last half hour or so, which ends on a flaccid note and doesn't generate the needed resolution for the solid build-up that came before.",
            "For all the suspense the film does generate, the fairly flat climax is a disappointing payoff."

            "In short, a wordy courtroom drama which seldom progresses beyond ciphers, stereotypes and salutary slogans.",
            "In Amistad, an admirable but disappointing effort...[Speilberg] veers between stoic political correctness and mushy Hollywood platitudes.",
            "Spielberg seems to be dividing his filmmaking output into two distinct halves: in the summer months cranking out no-brainer dinosaur flicks...in the winter season unveiling his serious artistic stuff to edify the adults and woo the Oscar crowd.",
            "Brief moments of visceral fire allow glimpses into the rousing movie this could have been.",
            "As Spielberg vehicles go, Amistad -- part mystery, action thriller, courtroom drama, even culture-clash comedy -- lands between the disturbing lyricism of Schindler's List and the storybook artificiality of The Color Purple.",
            "Amistad is certainly a film of considerable power.",
            "Amistad is worth seeing for the stormy scenes on board the slave boat, and for Djimon Hounsou's magnetic performance. Otherwise, it can't decide on its direction, and this unique historical event is stifled into a less than thrilling courtroom drama.",
            "'Amistad' may not be the first, or fifth, or tenth film people talk about when Spielberg's name comes up. But it has more moments that will put your hair on end than other filmmakers' best works, and that says something.",
            "Powerful story for mid-teens and up.",
            "Amistad is worth seeing just for people to know about this important story, this moment in history. But from the world's most powerful, successful and famous director, we expect more.",
            "Aiming to instruct and entertain, and often struggling to reconcile these goals, Amistad lacks the subtlety of tone and simplicity of form that made Schindler's List one of Spielberg's very best; here, however, every idea and image are too explicit.",
            "Fortunately, the dry, courtroom banter is interjected with powerful accounts of the violent, inhumane atrocities inflicted on the slaves by Spanish merchants.",
            "Amistad is the telling of an interesting event in American history, but doesn't draw its audience in to the heart of the story.",
            "This is the most straightforward, understated, and powerful big-screen representation of the gospel in recent movie history. And for that, Amistad should be recommended to everyone.",
            "As with Schindler&#8217;s List, Spielberg allows his subjects to be remote and somewhat unknowable human beings, creating an air of documentary-like authenticity.",
            "Amistad is the kind of movie that makes a tired topic seem fresh and entertaining again.",
            "Just when you thought you had seen the best movie there is about a historic seagoing vessel, along comes Amistad.",
            "Spielberg's films never lack a certain degree of narrative and visual force, but his tendency toward sentimentality, a strictly antipodal, Good-vs.-Bad conception of character, and an insensitivity to structure have consistently marred his work...",
            "Steven Spielberg's engaging, heartfelt and well-made drama delves into a critical incident in the history of slavery in America."

            "Romance comedies definitely come better than this, although perhaps not lately.",
            "It's fun to watch Jack Nicholson draw on great reservoirs of bile to play a mean SOB with an obsessive-compulsive disorder.",
            "It's a mark of how magically written, directed and acted As Good as It Gets is that we end up loving this film despite knowing how haphazard, scattershot and almost indefinable its charm is.",
            "This is the stuff of formula but director James L. Brooks and co-writer Mark Andrus elevate it with terrific writing. ",
            "On one hand, it's Brooks's film that most betrays his TV sitcom roots; it's also one of his more ambitious works, packing in subplots and subjects by the handful-indicative of a filmmaker who seems to genuinely struggle with the confines of the genre.",
            "Funny, but not a light comedy for youngsters.",
            "The greatest pleasures come from the acting.",
            "The movie's too long, and the direction is sometimes slack -- but the script is crammed with withering ripostes, ably delivered by Nicholson and Hunt.",
            "Not only one of the best romantic comedies of the year, but one of the best films in ages.",
            "Both funny and sad, the comedy was in the vein of Brooks' Terms of Endearment, except it was more eccentric and nuttier and in moments genuinely touching due to strong chemistry between Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt.",
            "An inflated TV show by a sitcom creator.",
            "The character is written as the most unlikable person one could ever meet. Despite this fact, Jack manages to make the character sympathetic.",

            "Mildly likable.",
            "...a precariously balanced movie, one that flirts with smugness. That it isn't awful is in some respects amazing. ",
            "... it coaxes us to be more open to each other, more compassionate, and more loving.",
            "Like Broadcast News, James L. Brooks' new film is a dark-edged adult comedy that hits the spot for those who like their romances splashed with acidic wit.",

            "Humorous, romantic, personal.",

            "A beautifully made survey of '70s excess, filtered through the trashy world of the burgeoning porno film industry in southern California.",
            "The pop 1970s were typified in part by cheesy fashions, ephemeral music and a regular diet of daring, cutting-edge movies that arguably made that decade Hollywood's richest. Blistering Boogie Nights recaptures the spirit of that time on all three counts.",
            "Boogie Nights, an epic tale of porn, pleasure, and excess, offers a purer hit of exhilaration than any movie this year.",
            "Not since the mysteriously reclusive Terrence Malick has there been such an explosion of sheer talent on the American movie scene.",
            "Considering the potentially explosive nature of the yarn, set in the porn world, Anderson's strategy is remarkably nonjudgmental and nonsensationalistic, largely due to his love and respect for all the characters and his impressive storytelling skills.",
            "In terms of sweep, ambition and precocious cinematic competence, it heralds the arrival of a new talent.",
            "A fantastic take on a Golden Era that nobody wants to remember and it's pretty relevant. [Full review in Spanish].",
            "...there is enough brilliance-including a drugs-and-guns showdown that outdoes Tarantino-to make it worth sticking around for the end of the party. And nothing could be truer to the Seventies than a party that goes on too long.",
            "It is remarkable that [Seymour Hoffman] was able to stand out-it's packed with great performances from some of the best of the best: Don Cheadle, John C. Reilly, William H. Macy, Heather Graham, and, of course, Burt Reynolds.",
            "The Tarantino comparison is ultimately less about technique than a shared joyful electricity of the filmmaking, the sense of an artist clearly high on the sheer act of making a movie.",
            "Nights humanized these actors and made them live beyond their reputations.",
            "Boogie Nights is an impassioned and creative portrait of American souls in distress from a young, passionate filmmaker who threw himself headlong into his movies (his follow-up, Magnolia, pushes even further). ",
            "Unflinching look at porn industry; lots of sex, drugs.",
            "An epic story of self-delusion with a skill and grace that many more experienced filmmakers would be hard put to match.",
            "Comparisons are invidious, but inescapable: Boogie Nights is the most stunningly accomplished, attention-grabbing movie by a sophomore director since Pulp Fiction.",
            "...loud, gaudy, profane, thoughtful, and risqu\u00e9; you can't say it isn't fun in its own exuberant way.",
            "Call it the consummate example of director-as-DJ, at least for now.",
            "The flashy style cannot hide the slight story.",
            "...Paul Thomas Anderson cements his reputation as one of the most gifted filmmakers of his generation...",
            "Probably the most enjoyable complete overrated swipe ever made.",
            "Aaaaw man, P.T. sure loves to move that camera around, and as a MAJOR fan of the general look and feel of movies, I totally got into his groove.",
            "Anderson eloquently blends these characters together for a tantalizing seriocomic medley. He keeps his proceedings glossy and tantalizing, while steady and harshly real.",
            "This film will hit a huge chord with those who weren't in diapers in the 70's, but people who missed the era should find penty to enjoy as well.",
            "An original film about a little-done subject, providing good acting and an interesting story."

            "Quentin Tarantino had a lot to live up to with this release and while he has not made a movie that has matched his previous successes, Jackie Brown is still a great film.",
            "It's slow, it's sad and it's very funny in ways that don't really revolve around punchlines. It's about characters who have been around the block one too many times and they're exhausted, full of dreams deferred, just trying to scrape by.",
            "While Jackie Brown can be too languid, drifting like one of Melanie's highs, its wearied, over-40 lows reveal Tarantino as a director who, once upon a crime, could've mined complexity and depth from the cracks and crevices of American genre movies.",
            "A much moodier, slower pace from Tarantino's other work, but Jackie Brown is one enjoyable flick that rewards its audience with each viewing.",
            "might be his best film",
            "Succeeds as a witty Elmore Leonard crime story...but also as a surprisingly affecting mid-life romance. [Blu-ray]",

            "Jim Carrey entertains himself mightily, and his enthusiasm is infectious.",
            "Close to an ideal jumping-off point for Carrey, who spends the better part of an hour grotesquely physicalizing his scummy lawyer's struggle with being obliged to utter cold, hard facts.",
            "Pretty rudimentary, but it keeps Carrey's occasional over-exuberance in check and delivers likeable, effective, but decidedly mainstream comedy.",

            "One of the best comedies of the '90s and one of Carrey's most enduring (and endearing) works.",

            "Despite being way, way, way (way) over-the-top at times, Liar Liar is vintage Jim Carrey and a nice return to form. Honestly.",
            "Carrey's frenzied physical and vocal contortions provide lots of amusing comic moments, as well as a few riotous ones, and the role is not only tailor-made for his rubber-faced antics but also gives him an opportunity to show a more human side.",
            "This is essentially a one-joke movie, but it's a nifty joke.",
            "Carrey's mugging glosses over some tough issues.",
            "A sickly soft-swirl confection of low laughs and smarmy sentiment...",

            "A product that has nothing, zero, zip going for it besides the presence of its star.",
            "After a while, Jim Carey's character making a fool of himself is becoming annoying and the ultra-sentimental finale doesn't ring a little bit true.",
            "Entregando-se com uma energia assustadoramente feroz ao personagem, Jim Carrey comprova mais uma vez seu dom para a com\u00e9dia f\u00edsica e transforma O Mentiroso em um filme simplesmente hil\u00e1rio.",
            "Strong on premise, the film is short on plot.",

            "For what is essentially a one-joke movie, this has an awful lot going for it.",
            "A soggy, all-over-the- place mess.",
            "An entertaining oddity, an amiably black comedy whose bared teeth double as an engaging smile: It takes a satiric bite and leaves you laughing through the pain. For that, we can thank the writers.",
            "Cusack might seem a bit frail to be regarded as a hitman, but his hyper-cool manner and razor-sharp delivery of the movie's cracking dialogue is never anything but convincing.",
            "Tackling the ravages of time with a rambunctious tone, \"Blank\" wraps emotional entropy and existential rumination into a clever, conceptual comedy that befits the '90s brethren like \"Defending Your Life\" or \"Groundhog Day\" alongside which it stands.",
            "If Grosse Pointe Blank (1997) was just another comedy in the wave of 80s nostalgia, then John Cusack is the kid who grew up to be Oliver North.",
            "[John] Cusack could not possibly have more perfect timing, and [Minnie] Driver could not be a better foil. ",
            "Quirky mix of laughs, romance, strong violence.",
            "With its darkly comic sensibilities and morally flawed protagonists, this won't be to everyone's taste, but those who can get on its wavelength will appreciate the savory witticisms and dryly acute observations.",
            "For John Cusack lovers, \"Grosse Pointe Blank\" is one of his best, an engaging showcase for his droll demeanor and a seamless blend of comedy and action. It's light entertainment, in spite of the body count.",
            "Silly black comedy fires a blank.",
            "One of the true delights of 1990s American cinema.",
            "A slick, mannered and frequently clever comedy.",

            "There is little to recommend in this nonsensical, repulsively gory outer-space yarn other than moody interiors and a few adequate special effects.",
            "But, to its credit, Event Horizon never pretends to be anything other than a series of highly efficient rip-offs.",
            "Very early on, this defective dramatic vehicle runs out of fuel, degenerates into a slasher/Hellraiser wannabe and self- destructs among explosions, flames and streams of blood.",
            "Anderson's attempt to show the world that Britain could do big-budget sci-fi just as well as Hollywood may have fizzled at the box office, but it's still a relatively effective deep space frightener.",
            "By the time the story gets rolling, the filmmakers are trying unsuccessfully to scare the audience with sudden loud noises and gallon upon gallon of fake blood.",
            "The film is content to relentlessly scream \"Boo!\" behind the audience's back rather than provide any real thrills",
            "Whether all the mind games, blood 'n' guts and loud bangs scare you or not depends on your tolerance of gore and horror, but director Paul Anderson keeps the picture stealthy and dark, aided by a crashing score from Mark Kamen.",
            "In space, apparently, no one can hear you direct.",
            "[Anderson] has little feeling for suspense - instead he lays on the violence and gore with a trowel and diminishing returns are the result.",
            "The settings and visual effects are imaginatively done, but the dialogue is silly and the plot is a mishmash.",
            "A misunderstood movie I loved on release and am thoroughly enjoying being smug about, now the rest of the world has realised its grave error. Tense and intensely frightening, though even after 20 years I have no idea what a baffle is."

            "One does not attend Mimic hoping for more than a few new twists on the durable old idea; such movies, like thrill rides at parks, work every single time if they have been well planned and constructed. But Mimic is superior to most of its cousins.",
            "...a picture revolving around human-sized killer cockroaches should be less of a slog and much more fun than this.",
            "The atmospheric settings are the most spectacular elements, perfectly utilizing flickering tunnels, moist walkways, noisy air vents, and murky flashlight beams.",
            "It seems Del Toro was given free rein to rework the film AND share candidly about the process that forced him to compromise so much in his original theatrical version.",
            "A dark story that entertains with artistic moments until it fizzles as it becomes derivative of those standard sci-fi horror Big Bug films from the fifties.",
            "It comes off smarter and creepier than I recall the original, less about scares than a sustained atmosphere of eerie unease and skittery threats.",

Ainda assim, a hist\u00f3ria \u00f3bvia, t\u00edpica de uma produ\u00e7\u00e3o B, resulta em um longa descart\u00e1vel.",

            "Visionary filmmaker Luc Besson manages to create several of the most exotic and original characters for this magnum opus of sensory outlandishness.",

            "It fuses slapstick with screwball comedy in brilliant ways, and appreciates the necessity of levity when considering heavy themes.",
            "Even 20 years on, The Fifth Element hasn't lost very much of its ability to thoroughly confound and dazzle.",
            "Luc Besson's The Fifth Element is a dazzling, funny, and exciting sci-fi actioner that features unforgettable characters and a thrilling story, making this one of the most underrated science-fiction classics around.",

            "I knew where it was going at all times, but the ride was excellent.",
            "The story is such a cut-rate kid's sci-fi fairy tale that at one point Evil actually calls Gary Oldman on the phone (and it isn't played for laughs).",
            "Besson has done a solid, if not outstanding, job in bringing his story, written as a teenager, to the big screen.",
            "This gonzo sci-fi outing proves to be a messy amalgam -- a motion picture with the body of a mainstream blockbuster but the spirit of a trendy cult flick. And yet, for all its narrative incoherencies, visual excesses and shifting moods, the movie works."
