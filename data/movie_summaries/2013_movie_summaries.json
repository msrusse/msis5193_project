He also happens to be the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the land of enlightenment: France. With his silver mane and tanned, athletic body, he stalks the world stage, from the floor of the United Nations in New York to the powder keg of Oubanga. There, he calls on the powerful and invokes the mighty to bring peace, to calm the trigger-happy, and to cement his aura of Nobel Peace Prize winner-in-waiting. Alexandre Taillard de Vorms is a force to be reckoned with, waging his own war backed up by the holy trinity of diplomatic concepts: legitimacy, lucidity and efficacy. He takes on American neo-cons, corrupt Russians and money-grabbing Chinese. Perhaps the world doesn't deserve France's magnanimousness, but his art would be wasted if just restricted to home turf. Enter the young Arthur Vlaminck, graduate of the elite National School of Administration, who is hired as head of \"language\" at the foreign ministry. In other words, he is to write the minister's speeches. But he also has to learn to deal with the sensibilities of the boss and his entourage, and find his way between the private secretary and the special advisers who stalk the corridors of the Quai d'Orsay - the ministry's home - where stress, ambition and dirty dealing are the daily currency.

Oblivious to the danger, a group of hip students from all over the world, who now attend school together in New York, are planning a memorial to celebrate the lives of their lost \"brothers and sisters\" who died suddenly in a tragic plane crash a year prior. Aspiring actress EVE, her athletic boyfriend SEBASTIAN, bad boy gone good DOMINIC, tough but sweet JOAN, hip hop mogul on the rise, VALENTINE and beautiful, carefree MARIA, soon begin to turn up dead, one by one. As more dead bodies mount, detectives JOSEPH and MICHAEL are in a race against time to stop the serial killing. The crime scenes and the way each victim was killed lead the detectives to theorize that each of the killings may be linked to the victims' ancient namesakes. Those namesakes are known to be some of the most saintly people that have graced the earth. As evidence continues to mount and more body bags are gathered, the detectives are convinced that the killer is basing his crimes on the belief that every generation has 36 righteous individuals who live among us, where, with all of them gone, the world would fall into chaos, corruption and eventual darkness. The hunt is on to find the last of the 36 Saints before the killer does.  Written by AFPSee less",

Presently, the growing trend in gun control favors the wealthy and privileged, who leverage their connections to ensure their Second Amendment rights and safety, while those of lesser means struggle. Informative and emotionally charged, \"Assaulted: Civil Rights Under Fire\" is an eye-opening look at the genesis of the Second Amendment to the Constitution, leading the audience to rethink the issues surrounding gun control, and the effect on civil rights and liberty.
