Villagers are simple and diligent people who struggle to cope with a harsh nature. They earn their living, on a daily survival basis, out of the earth and of a few animals they feed. Just like the animals and trees around them, they have the knowledge of their temporary existence, hence a sober resignation prevails. They live according to the rhythm of the earth, air and water, day and night and seasons. The daily time is divided into five parts by the sound of the call to prayer. Every day, all human events are lived through within these five time slices. In child raising, grownups go on with the practice they have experienced by their parents. They expose their love awkwardly and consider beating a favorable method. Fathers always prefer one of their sons. Mothers command their daughters ruthlessly. \u00d6mer, Yakup and Yildiz, three children of about 12,13 years old, just between childhood and youth, are the prominent characters in this movie of five times. \u00d6mer, the son of the imam, wishes hopelessly for the death of his father. When he understands that wishful thinking does not have any concrete results, he begins to search for childish ways to kill his father. He shares his guilty thoughts with his friend Yakup. Children study in the village school consisting of only one classroom. Families show their gratitude to the young woman teacher by giving her presents -the bread they cook themselves, the milk of their own sheep. Yakup is in love with his teacher. He hides his guilty feelings even from his best friend \u00d6mer. When some day he sees his father spying the teacher, he dreams, like Yakup, of killing his father. Yildiz both studies and tries to manage the household works imposed by her own mother. She tries to be a mother for her baby brother. On the other hand, she learns with irritation about the secrets of the relationship between men and women. Five times elapse. Children, oscillating between rage and guilt, grow up slowly. \u00d6mer gives up killing his father. Stuck between love and hate, he cries desperately.  Written by omayra73@yahoo.comSee less",

When Rani introduces Ashish to her businessman dad, Tau, and mom, they unanimously frown upon this alliance, until Ashish promises to get a job, save enough money, buy a flat, etc.. Ashish does get a small job with Izzat Papads, and then also starts selling steroids out of the back of a van. He gets noticed by a Ad-firm owner, and gets hired. Soon he has all the luxuries that he had always dreamed of. When the Bhallas come to know about this, they decide to welcome him as their son-law, and a lavish engagement party takes place. It is then Ashish finds out that he has cancer, and he begins to create misunderstandings between him and Rani. He tries becoming an alcoholic, but that is considered normal with the Bhalla family; he confesses to Rani that he has loved Sania, a model with ad-agency, which is welcomed by Rani as being truthful and honest. But when Rani notices that he has put up Sania's photos all over his apartment, it is then that she breaks off the engagement. Ashish knows that Sania will not marry him, as she is a flirt. But when he is assigned to go to Malaysia with Sania, that is where he finds out that Sania is not quite a flirt, but wants to marry him. She even introduces him to her brother, Anna, who instantly approves of the match. Now Anna inducts Ashish into the family business - which is extortion, and a stunned Ashish is trained to be use guns and defend himself. When the time comes for marriage, Ashish confesses that he has cancer. An angered Anna summons Dr. Rustom, who in turn gives a clean health chit, and confirms that Ashish had overhead a conversation about another patient and had misunderstood. A hapless Ashish, fresh out of lies, must now resign himself to getting married to Sania - or else be hunted down and killed by Anna and his gang.  Written by rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)See less",

The film delivers a surprisingly candid look at Robert Wilson, who drops his characteristic reticence and speaks with unprecedented candor about his personal life. Nothing is left in the shadows, as he discusses his troubled and lonely childhood as the son of the Mayor of Waco, Texas, his early learning disabilities, his work with disabled children using therapy as a tool for artistic expression, his departure from Texas at the time of his coming out and his fascination with the downtown New York avant-garde scene of the late 60's. What emerges is a life full of impressions, colors and rhythms, making it all the more poignant how Wilson's early hardships ultimately shaped his ground-breaking aesthetic vision. More than a biography, the film becomes an exhilarating exploration of the transformative power of creativity itself and the inspirational tale of a shy, stuttering boy who grew up to become a fearless artist with a profoundly original perspective to share with the world.See less",

Karnail Singh was one such suspect, who claims that he has had no hand in any terrorism activity, but is nevertheless pursued by the Police, leaving his widowed mom, Kartar, and sister, Parsan, to fend for themselves by running a Dhaba and being subjected to harassment at the hands of Inspector Ujagar Singh, while the village Mukhiya wants Parsan to get married to a much older Narang Singh. Parsan's problems are resolved when Indian Army Captain Nihal Singh intervenes, and marries her, even though her mom, beaten senseless by the Police, passes away on the day of the marriage. Months later, Nihal must re-locate to Siachen, leaving behind a pregnant Parsan. Once in Siachen, he gets news that Parsan has been attacked and is hospitalized. Since Siachen is isolated due to a heavy snowstorm, he can only return home after several days, and is told that Parsan has passed away, and his new-born daughter has been abducted by his neighbors, Sukhwant Kaur, and Mandeep Singh. Nihal's attempts to locate the couple are all in vain, and things get worse when the Station House Officer is transferred and the new incumbent, his arch-enemy, Ujagar, refuses to locate his daughter. Nihal confronts Ujagar, arguments and fisticuffs ensue, resulting in Ujagar's death. Nihal is arrested, stripped off of his uniform, tried in Court, found guilty, and sentenced to 20 years in jail - and may never be reunited with his daughter.

On their one day off per week, they perform as drag performers in a group called the Paper Dolls. On the political level, it explores the perils of global immigration. In this case, after the second Intifada, the Israeli government unofficially opened its doors to illegal workers to replace the Palestinians who were no longer allowed in the country. As tensions with the Palestinians eased, the government changed its policy and began to forcibly deport these foreign guest workers with dramatic consequences for our characters. On the human level, the film is about people who are rejected by their own families for being gay/transvestite and who emigrate and end up with jobs taking care of other people's parents who have been rejected by their own children because they are old, difficult, etc. They work grueling hours to send money back to the Philippines to support the families that have rejected them.

A spoiled brat speeds off in her boyfriend's car. Follow it to a bad idea. The good girl is saving up for a plane ticket.Follow her as hope takes off. Fall to Grace, a debut film by Mari Marchbanks, has a taut script with an epic heart. Kristofer, a Russian-Georgian emigrant, is trying to make his way in a new country, a new school and onto the varsity team. Living under the weight of his father's anger and economic hardship, Kristofer keeps himself afloat with a basketball and a flirtatious spirit. But when Sarah flirts back, Kristofer begins to realize he may have come on to the wrong girl. Sarah has her hands full trying to keep her random drug use within the range of an excusable cry for attention, but it's quickly becoming a real problem. Like so many troubles, a stack of money would go a long way toward making things better, but the only available cash lies in a shoebox at the bottom of Jessie's closet and Jessie's Dad is a cop. As these individual stories intersect and collide, heartache ignites into remarkable hope.

As such, Rebecca goes on a search for Rita through Vancouver's notorious downtown eastside, where over the years many aboriginal women, marginalized in society, have been found dead, most under the mysterious but suspicious circumstance of being alone in their single room occupancy (SRO) hotel with excessively high blood alcohol levels. Many of these women were officially classified as missing before their dead bodies discovered. Although she comes across a few leads, Rebecca believes the strongest lead in finding her mother is through a man named Norman, who claims to have seen the woman in the photograph, who he refers to as Shadie, sometime recently.
