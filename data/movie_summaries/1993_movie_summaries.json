The Odoms have lived a life of the traditions of the American south in their longtime, large family beach front home. That tradition is turned upside down when younger daughter, bright high school senior Lucille Odom, arrives home to find a note from her mother, Helen Odom, that note which states that she has left for good.

The family patriarch, retired Warren Odom, believes his wife will eventually return. To help with the situation, Warren and Lucille request the return of Warren's eldest daughter/Lucille's older sister, Rae Odom. However, Rae has her own issues as she arrives with her new Yankee husband, Billy McQueen, and news that they got married because she's pregnant, about which she doesn't seem too happy.

But as each of the individual adult family members deal with their immediate situations - for Warren which includes if there is a second chance on love, most specifically with hairdresser Vera Delmage - Lucille may come to an understanding of her past and future.

Facing dismissal from the top perch of Hollywood and finacial ruin from back taxes, he is forced to take on a very commercial and, he believes, ridiculous movie. Now as he faces the film's release and, he believes, another total flop which will complete his ruin, he meets up with his son and daughter and his former wives (which includes Dyan Cannon) to examine his life and his future.

His agent (Jerry Stiller) assures him that he has a hit, while those around him wince (as does the audience) at the thought of the movie within the movie. The movie is \"The Pickle\", a supposedly social satire where a bunch of super-white kids from Kansas take vegetables into space via a super cucumber and land on an Earth-like planet where everyone lives only on beef and die at age 49. As shown in the excerpts of the film, Little Richard stars as the President of the planet who has 6 months to live, Ally Sheedy heads up the Kansas contingent, and Griffin Dunne is the President's aide who falls in love with Sheedy.
