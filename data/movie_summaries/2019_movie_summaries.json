On Thursday, August 1, join Dead Heads in your neighborhood - and around the world - when Trafalgar Releasing and Rhino Entertainment celebrate the 9th Annual Grateful Dead Meet-Up at the Movies. This can't-miss event - the first to go global - features the previously unreleased complete June 17, 1991 concert from Giants Stadium. Widely considered one of the greatest shows of the band's final decade of performing, 6/17/91 also sounds unlike any Dead show you've ever heard as it was one of only two recorded on 48-track. Mixed by Jeffr ey Norman in glorious surround sound with video from the multi-camera live edit, this will be the first time the Bruce Hornsby and Vince Welnick line-up has ever appeared on the big screen . Opening with a shocking \"Eyes Of The World,\" the Dead were firing on all cylinders from the opening notes of the show, mixing beloved classics like \"Truckin'\" and \"Uncle John's Band\" with rarities including \"Saint Of Circumstance,\" \"Might l MYAs bl,\" \"New Speedway Boogie,\" and \"China Doll.\" But the real standout was the recurrence of \"Dark Star,\" which wove in and out of the setlist, making no less than six distinct appearances and teases during the show. The Dead capped off the spectacularly night with a perfect song to send the crowd on its way - The Band's \"The Weight.\"  Written by Trafalgar ReleasingSee less",

Smooth talking and seductive, Victor was raised to do one thing only, which is to kill for money. When he is sent to the home of a brutal drug lord to collect payment for his most recent hit, he encounters the beautiful Sarai (Alicia Sanz), who has been forced to spend the last 9 years of her life with the drug lord. After Victor leaves the compound, Sarai seizes her chance at freedom by hiding out in Victor's car. But things don't go as planned and instead of being transported back to her home, she finds herself free from one dangerous man only to be caught in the clutches of another. While on the run from the vengeful drug lord and his brutal henchmen, Victor's conscience catches up with him as he risks all that he stood for to protect his captive. In the end, the power Sarai unknowingly holds over Victor and their undeniable attraction may be what places her right in the arms of a killer.  Written by PantelionSee less",

The film pulls back the emotional layers surrounding the five days during which the community housed, fed and cared for the dislocated passengers (or the \"come from aways\" in Newfoundland parlance). While their stories were the inspiration for the extraordinary Broadway hit musical, Come From Away, the documentary, You Are Here, reveals first-hand accounts of the great kindnesses and energetic resourcefulness the community showed their unexpected guests. Their emotional and sometimes humorous story of compassion and generosity, born of a long history of rescuing and welcoming shipwrecked sailors, resonates with a legacy of healing and reconciliation for the world - especially for the survivors of those murdered on 9/11, and for the first responders who lost their own lives saving others on that fateful day.

To further complicate the daily rigors of teenage life, her father, Robert, an advertising executive who has since rebuilt his business, tries to do the same with his relationship with his daughter. Against his therapist's advice, overeager Robert tries really hard to get close to Tennie by showing his own way of caring. He tries to find out about his daughter's personal life with the help of his newly appointed, 19 year-old driver/intern, Jack. Practically being raised by her extended family, Tennie although very academically inclined and mature for her age, with compassion for others, she's got a touch of sarcasm, and a hint of rebelliousness. After she catches on to her father's plan, Tennie realizes that in order to get her father off of her back, she needs to convince him to find a lady friend. She recruits her friends to create an online dating profile in order to introduce her father to potential companions. Little did she know that her father already was seeing someone that he was not yet ready to introduce to her. Things escalate when Robert gets Tennie's friends from school to participate in a focus group for a project, and in retaliation, Tennie throws a party at the house with almost half of the school showing up. A series of hilarious interactions between father and daughter ensues that starts to close the generational gap between them. What finally brings them together is a long overdue heart to heart conversation about past transgressions. One thing becomes certain, they will always have each other.See less",
