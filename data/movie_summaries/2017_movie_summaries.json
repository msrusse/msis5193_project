Yet here we also discover her as a lover, daughter, mother, sister and even grandmother, as she submits herself to our gaze and allows us to understand what constitutes her mask. The stage is where her most extreme embodiments are realised and her theatrical imagination lets loose: this is where the musical of her life is played out. The film includes Grace's unique performances singing iconic hits such as Slave To The Rhythm, Pull Up To The Bumper, as well as the more recent autobiographical tracks Williams' Bloods and Hurricane. These personal songs also link to Grace's family life, as the film takes us on a holiday road trip across Jamaica, where her family roots and the story of her traumatic childhood are uncovered. In Jamaican patois, 'Bloodlight' is the red light that illuminates when an artist is recording and 'Bami' means bread, the substance of daily life. Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami weaves together the layers of Grace Jones' public and private life, as she moves effortlessly between different facets: she is gypsy, artist and partying hedonist, warm and funny but also a fierce and tenacious businesswoman. The performance continues to move thematically though the film, with Love Is The Drug acting like an aria, bringing the film to its final and most touching scenes. This is a Grace we have not seen before, someone who reminds us of what it is to dare to be truly alive.See less",

I'll Push You is an up-close and personal look into the dynamics of a life-long friendship between of two best friends - Justin Skeesuck and Patrick Gray - as they travel across El Camino de Santiago. This feature-length documentary covers the struggle of the 34-day, 500-mile hike across mountains, deserts, hills, and valleys and features perspectives from family and friends. Even though the story begins with the challenges that come with Patrick's answering of the invitation to push Justin in a wheelchair across northern Spain, it also explores the struggles related to Justin's rare neurological disease. The parallel paths of Patrick's experience in Spain and Justin's life journey come together in a singular moment to reveal to Patrick something unezpected. The story's beautiful cinematography is set to poignant music tracks that underscore, perfectly, the inspiring example of generosity and vulnerability on display. The film is an intimate portrait of an epic journey and explores the true meaning of friendship, generosity, and vulnerability. It's a one-of-a-kind documentary chronicling their pilgrimage, which will resonate with viewers craving stories of faith, hope, love, and the power of community. Their trek in 2014 captured the imagination of the world and was featured in the Huffington Post, The Meredith Vieira Show, Der Spiegel, Fox and Friends, and many other outlets.

The film features archive footage and interviews with various models, artists and filmmakers who worked closely with Beaton during his illustrious career. Beaton was not only a dazzling chronicler of his time, but a supreme arbiter of its tastes. From the Bright Young Things, to the front lines of World War II, and from the international belle monde and the pages of Vogue to a role as the Queen's official photographer, Beaton embodied the cultural and political schisms of the twentieth century. In this warm - though critical - portrait, which blends archival footage and photographs with voice over from Beaton's famed diaries to capture his legacy as a complex and unique creative force.

It was during and after World War I that the Ottoman Empire carried out the systematic mass murder of 1.5 million Christian Armenian citizens, but also 950,000 Greek and 750,000 Assyrian Christians. To this day, the Armenian people are persecuted in the Middle East for their beliefs - and many are kept from their true home. Turkey, which is the successor state to the Ottoman Empire, still denies the extent and the systematic nature of the atrocities and doesn't use the word genocide for these well-documented events. Other governments officially deny the Armenian Genocide as well because of political pressure by their ally Turkey. \"Architects of Denial\" not only digs into the persecution of Armenians and other Christians in the Middle East, both past and present, but it also sheds light on those politicians who refuse to acknowledge an event scholars accept as a sad reality and historical fact.See less",

Isabelle Huppert commands the screen as Araminte, the wealthy widow who unwittingly hires the smitten Dorante (Louis Garrel) as her accountant. Secrets and lies accumulate as Dorante and his accomplice, Araminte's manservant Dubois (Yves Jacques), manipulate not only the good-hearted Araminte, but also her friend and confidante, Marton (Manon Combes). Dorante, by turns pitiable and proficient, but always deferential to his social better, walks a fine line in his quest to arouse an equal desire in the object of his affections. Bulle Ogier delivers a memorable turn as Araminte's mother, who suspects the young man's intentions, but wants to push her daughter into the arms of an aged, hard-up Count (Jean-Pierre Malo).

Only 22 of them remain today to speak out publicly. This documentary is not a film for political gains or narrow nationalistic purposes. For the director and the crew, each and every one of those elderly women is a brave and strong individual with similar yet distinctive experiences. This is a group that deserves to be known and correctly understood by more people and a history worth being preserved in a most accurate yet sensitive way. In the documentary, the current situation of those 22 elderly women will be presented in an impersonal way. There's no interrogation, sympathy, nor exaggeration in our film. You will hear them talk about their own experiences, and you will also learn about their perspectives on life, sufferings and happiness. Now all over 80 or 90 years old, those elderly ladies are at the very last stage of their life.

Moving through the corridors and bowels of the enormous and disorientating structure, the camera takes the viewer on a journey to a place of dehumanising physical labor and intense hardship, provoking cause for thought about persistent pre-industrial working conditions and the huge divide between first world and developing countries.

MACHINES portraits only one of these factories, while at the same time representing the thousands of labourers working, living and suffering in an environment they can't escape without unity.
