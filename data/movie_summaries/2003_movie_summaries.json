Now a charming thirty-something-single woman, Federica's fantasies have evolved, adding lovers, stardom, and motherhood to her waking dreams, where Federica continues to press for her everyday life to be as real as the fantasies that invade her. Unfortunately, Federica's daydreams can only provide a meager distraction from the reality she faces. Her career as a successful playwright is heading south, her boyfriend is pressuring her to start a family, a former lover wishes to rekindle an old affair, her sister is barely talking to her, her brother is self-centered and her loving father is terminally ill. And as if to make matters worse, Federica is rich, too rich, and the guilt that consumes her because of it is pushing her over the edge. As Federica struggles to find meaning in her life, she wrestles with her feelings about death and responsibility. She alleviates the added weight of the haunting guilt that her wealth derives through her vivid imagination, where her reality grows wonderful and, if only fleetingly, gives her the sense that all is perfect in her world.

In fifty-four years of capturing the worldwide flavor of alpine skiing and kindred adventure sports, the Warren Miller crew has traveled to every corner of the globe. This season's Journey offers another prismatic view of the kaleidoscope of winter sports, taking the viewer on a voyage inside the soul of skiing. Ports of call include the treeless snowfields of Portillo, Chile; the savage couloirs of Chamonix, France; the sheer descents of the Chugach Range in Alaska; and the powder paradise of Bella Coola, British Columbia. A backwater romp through the wilds of Morocco provides a pungent whiff of the exotic, while a visit to a very unfrozen lake in Helena, Montana, is no less strange. As Doug Coombs remarks to his friends in a Chamonix bar after a long day of indulging diverse challenges, 'It's not about the destination, it's about the journey.' True, but there's also a lot to be said for the destinations along the trail of Warren Miller's Journey.See less",

But things do not go as planned when Harish finds out that Mohan actually is a snob, who hates F.O.Bs.

The SRA's act as 'portals' on the Internet, helping users to fulfill their dreams. The SRA's are nourished through touch. Because they were bred only with Rosetta's DNA, they need the balance of an Y chromo or male sperm to survive. Rosetta projects seduction scenes from movie clips onto Ruby, which absorbs as she sleeps. The SRA'S can not distinguish dreams from reality. Ruby acts out these scenes in real life with the men and shares her spoils with her sisters. However, Ruby's encounters suffer from impotence and unexplained rashes. Fearing a bio-gender war, the FBI sends in Agent Edward Hopper to solve the mystery. Puzzled, he turns for help from a private cyber detective. The men recover. Ruby falls in love and becomes impregnated by Sandy, a xerox shop worker. The characters struggle to find love in a world that no longer needs sex to reproduce, a world that is changing and is populated with people who use provisional identities and are seen through virtual selves and a world where love is the only thing that makes things real.

Saanvri goes around the village raising awareness, and incurs the wrath of the village elders, mostly members of the Gujjar family. When Saanvri persists with her efforts, five of the men severely beat-up Sohan, and gang-rape Saanvri. A devastated Saanvri and Sohan decide to get justice. They go to the Police Station, but the Police Inspector refuses to lodge a complaint until and unless he gets a Medical report. The doctor will not issue a medical report until and until he gets Court Order. Sohan and Saanvri, with Shobha's help do go through this process, and a complaint is finally lodged. Despite of this, the Gujjars are not arrested and continue to wander around, bragging about their experience with Saanvri. Saanvri's case then gets nation-wide attention, with the Prime Minister himself entrusting this investigation to the Central Bureau of Investigation. The Gujjars are arrested and tried in Court, but are fully aware that this is nothing but a charade, for they have the backing of the local Member of the Legislative Assembly, Dhanraj Meena, who has hired a lawyer, Purohit, and has instructed him to ensure that the Gujjars are not held liable. Watch as Judge after Judge is transferred, even the Prosecuting Attorney is of a upper caste, and is under pressure from the Gujjar community.

Principle photography began in July 1999 when the band, Bering Strait, entered the United States and began recording their first album in Nashville. The film documents the band responding to the twists and turns of the recording industry, rehearsing for their tour, preparing for their debut concert at the Grand Ole Opry, charting the course for their career with their managers, and living every-day life on the farm where they reside in rural Tennessee. The crew traveled with the band to their homes in Obninsk, Russia and to their music conservatories in Moscow, documenting how these two girls and five boys became so adept at playing American country music. The film culminates with the band's arrival on the U.S. stage at Wolf Trap National Park. \"The Ballad of Bering Strait\" is a two and a half year epic that follows Bering Strait's amazing cultural fusion-coming of age journey in America.
