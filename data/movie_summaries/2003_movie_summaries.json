Now a charming thirty-something-single woman, Federica's fantasies have evolved, adding lovers, stardom, and motherhood to her waking dreams, where Federica continues to press for her everyday life to be as real as the fantasies that invade her. Unfortunately, Federica's daydreams can only provide a meager distraction from the reality she faces. Her career as a successful playwright is heading south, her boyfriend is pressuring her to start a family, a former lover wishes to rekindle an old affair, her sister is barely talking to her, her brother is self-centered and her loving father is terminally ill. And as if to make matters worse, Federica is rich, too rich, and the guilt that consumes her because of it is pushing her over the edge. As Federica struggles to find meaning in her life, she wrestles with her feelings about death and responsibility. She alleviates the added weight of the haunting guilt that her wealth derives through her vivid imagination, where her reality grows wonderful and, if only fleetingly, gives her the sense that all is perfect in her world.

In fifty-four years of capturing the worldwide flavor of alpine skiing and kindred adventure sports, the Warren Miller crew has traveled to every corner of the globe. This season's Journey offers another prismatic view of the kaleidoscope of winter sports, taking the viewer on a voyage inside the soul of skiing. Ports of call include the treeless snowfields of Portillo, Chile; the savage couloirs of Chamonix, France; the sheer descents of the Chugach Range in Alaska; and the powder paradise of Bella Coola, British Columbia. A backwater romp through the wilds of Morocco provides a pungent whiff of the exotic, while a visit to a very unfrozen lake in Helena, Montana, is no less strange. As Doug Coombs remarks to his friends in a Chamonix bar after a long day of indulging diverse challenges, 'It's not about the destination, it's about the journey.'

Julien sets out on his annual attempt to find a rare species of butterfly that he had once promised his son he would find (son dead) in the French country side, specifically a region known as Vercors. Elsa stows away in his car. After being discovered she convinces him to let her come to Vercors with him. They bond while hiking and camping until Julien, who is initially annoyed by Elsa, near the end of the film seems to have a grandfather-granddaughter relationship with her. Elsa falls in a well. The police arrest Julien. Elsa tells everyone it is cool. Isabelle starts paying attention to her child. Julien and Elsa are friends.

After ten years of being ignored by record producers, Jacki and the band find hope in one producer who promises to see them play and consider them for a contract. Jacki resolves to play this one last gig and then throw in the towel if she does not find success. Personal tragedies, however, threaten to rip the band apart, rocking the foundation of friendship and trust the women have built together. Ultimately, the band must find its strength in the music that is their passion and the thread that holds them together, inspiring them to prevail.  Written by Cheri LovedogSee less",

His dad, Satish Kumar, wants him to re-locate to the U.S., live with the Bakshis, study, and marry the girl of his choice. Harish must first go through the blessings of an Astrologer, Bholey Shankar Maharaj, who blesses him, informs him that he will meet a girl whose name will start with \"P\", who he will marry. An overly excited Harish travels all the way to Houston, Texas, U.S. where he is met fondly by the Bakshi family, consisting of Mrs. and Dr. Bakshi, Mohan, and Deepu. In keeping with the fear and paranoia after the September 11 attacks, Mrs. Bakshi has made it a practice to place American flags in the front pockets of her sons, and she does it now for Harish as well. Mohan is around Harish's age and shows him around the campus. Harish meets with a beautiful Malyalee girl, Priya, and falls in love with her. But things do not go as planned when Harish finds out that Mohan actually is a snob, who hates F.O.Bs. (Fresh off the Boat) Indians like him; the girl Priya is actually in love with another young man by the name of Raju, and her name's not Priya - it's Supriya; and due to Harish's accent, oily hair, & c. he is not being invited to the party where everybody else is invited. Looks like Harish is headed for more pitfalls than he had bargained for, and it also looks like the Maharaj may have been wrong after all.  Written by AnonymousSee less",

The SRA's act as 'portals' on the Internet, helping users to fulfill their dreams. The SRA's are nourished through touch. Because they were bred only with Rosetta's DNA, they need the balance of an Y chromo or male sperm to survive. Rosetta projects seduction scenes from movie clips onto Ruby, which absorbs as she sleeps. The SRA'S can not distinguish dreams from reality. Ruby acts out these scenes in real life with the men and shares her spoils with her sisters. However, Ruby's encounters suffer from impotence and unexplained rashes. Fearing a bio-gender war, the FBI sends in Agent Edward Hopper to solve the mystery. Puzzled, he turns for help from a private cyber detective. The men recover. Ruby falls in love and becomes impregnated by Sandy, a xerox shop worker. The characters struggle to find love in a world that no longer needs sex to reproduce, a world that is changing and is populated with people who use provisional identities and are seen through virtual selves and a world where love is the only thing that makes things real.

After watching their father being gunned down in front of their eyes as children, Thomas and Sean Phelan grow up building their lives on opposite ends of the law. Thomas, the studious and responsible brother, creates a better life for himself through education and hard, honest work. Eventually, he builds a successful career as a US Attorney. Sean, the more rebellious of the two, gets caught up in a life of crime and rises through the ranks to become the head of the Irish Mob.

She does succeed in recruiting a young housewife, Saanvri, the mother of a young girl, Kamli, and wife of rickshaw driver, Sohan. Saanvri goes around the village raising awareness, and incurs the wrath of the village elders, mostly members of the Gujjar family. When Saanvri persists with her efforts, five of the men severely beat-up Sohan, and gang-rape Saanvri. A devastated Saanvri and Sohan decide to get justice. They go to the Police Station, but the Police Inspector refuses to lodge a complaint until and unless he gets a Medical report. The doctor will not issue a medical report until and until he gets Court Order. Sohan and Saanvri, with Shobha's help do go through this process, and a complaint is finally lodged. Despite of this, the Gujjars are not arrested and continue to wander around, bragging about their experience with Saanvri. Saanvri's case then gets nation-wide attention, with the Prime Minister himself entrusting this investigation to the Central Bureau of Investigation. The Gujjars are arrested and tried in Court, but are fully aware that this is nothing but a charade, for they have the backing of the local Member of the Legislative Assembly, Dhanraj Meena, who has hired a lawyer, Purohit, and has instructed him to ensure that the Gujjars are not held liable. Watch as Judge after Judge is transferred, even the Prosecuting Attorney is of a upper caste, and is under pressure from the Gujjar community. Faced with a corrupt police force, an even more corrupt Judicial system fueled more by wealth, influence, and caste rather than the rule of law, will Saanvri succeed in getting the justice she deserves?

Principle photography began in July 1999 when the band, Bering Strait, entered the United States and began recording their first album in Nashville. The film documents the band responding to the twists and turns of the recording industry, rehearsing for their tour, preparing for their debut concert at the Grand Ole Opry, charting the course for their career with their managers, and living every-day life on the farm where they reside in rural Tennessee. The crew traveled with the band to their homes in Obninsk, Russia and to their music conservatories in Moscow, documenting how these two girls and five boys became so adept at playing American country music. The film culminates with the band's arrival on the U.S. stage at Wolf Trap National Park. \"The Ballad of Bering Strait\" is a two and a half year epic that follows Bering Strait's amazing cultural fusion-coming of age journey in America.
